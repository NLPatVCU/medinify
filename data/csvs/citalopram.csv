"My doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram for depression.  After a few weeks, there was some improvement, but I felt the drug helped my anxiety more than the depression.  The dose was increased to 40mg.  Still felt ""lopsided"", in that the anxiety was under control but not the depression.  This drug clouded my judgement, as I said some things and felt like I put my foot in my mouth!  Very embarrassing! I mentioned these things to my doctor.  She said Citalopram is more for anxiety than it is for depression. My doctor switched me to another drug, which is helping alot.",9/5/2019 9:38:46 PM,citalopram oral,2.0,2.0,1.0

"Depression is so hard to deal with because first you have to be get out of the funk enough to realize you need help.

"I am somewhat happy with the medication Citalopram HBR 20MG which I have recently been increased to 30MGs. I used to work in corrections, but now work as a security officer. However, whilst working security March 15, 2015 in an apartment complex, I was lured into the parkade due to a fire alarm where 6 men were waiting for Me. I have since suffered from night terrors, but refused to be a victim so I returned to work for 1 year, then the depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts came. Workers comp had Me see a PTSD Psychologist right after the attack for 2 visits, then had Me see him again. He diagnosed Me with delayed onset post traumatic stress, however WCB will only look at the physical aspects of the attack, not the psychological ones. I have now voluntarily been admitted to the psych ward due to wanting to end My life and the Psychiatrist here has put Me on Citalopram. The night terrors have not stopped at all, but I've learned a new coping method by looking for something particular in the room (like My chair) as a grounding to let Me know that I am not at work and the attack is not real. Since taking the 30 Mg of Citalopram the thoughts of ending my life have ceased greatly. Iind myself a lot happier, yet am tired more. ",7/28/2018 4:10:34 PM,citalopram oral,3.0,3.0,5.0

"I took this medication for over 1 year for anxiety, OCD, and suicidal thoughts/behaviour and I have to say, it did wonders for my anxiety. Unfortunately, it did very little for my OCD, and I did not notice much benifit from citalopram for OCD. It helped the suicidal tendancies a little bit, but not very much. I took 40mg once per day. Personally, I think this tablet is more for anxiety more than anything else. People with generalised anxiety disorder would probably benefit best from this tablet, but everyone is different.
The side-effects I had were increased sweating, sleepiness, increased salivation, memory problems, strange dreams, tiredness, trembling, and yawning. These side-effects lasted about 5 - 10 days, then they went, except for the strange dreams, that lasted about 4 months, which I loved. The dreams that citalopram caused me made me look forward to going to bed.

"It took quite a while for it to work. I started at 10mg, then uped to 20mg which is what my dr recommended me at. I have had severe depression since before I hit puberty and am now 24, almost 25 (I hit puberty at around 9-10). I suffered through my entire per-adult life and well into the beginning of it. I finally took control iPad started this medication. Talking therapy didn't work. Everything I tried didn't work. Finally, after about 6-8 months on this medication (yes really) I feel fantastic. I've never been happier. I don't remember feeling this great. Its like I actually see colors again. I'm trying to stop this medication now, since I think I can finally deal without it (it's been Bout a year) and I'm having a bit of a difficult time with it though.

I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued.

"I was on Cymbalta several years ago for depression and anxiety due to life experiences and I felt as I should. I felt ok, still with emotion but ok and not overwhelmed. I moved to a new state 7 years ago and could not afford my med for a very long time due to layoffs, no insurance, etc. I have recently been able to go back and restart on Citalopram after realizing that I still suffer from anxiety, occasional panic attacks, slight depression and irritability. I am only on day 3...... Day 1; Took 20mg on Friday night before bed, woke up at 3am and could not get back to sleep (this to me is very upsetting because I have struggled for the last few years with sleep issues and recently purchased a new tempurpedic mattress that has totally fixed that problem, now I'm back to not sleeping all night)  I was lethargic and made very deliberate and slow moves all day, although I felt fine. Day 2; Same problem after taking it at night woke up between 3 and 5 AM and could not get back to sleep. The rest of the day however, I felt just fine, no more grogginess just normal. Day 3; Woke up again at 4/5 am but had taken a melatonin before I went to bed and I was able to fall back asleep. Tonight,  I will be taking the melatonin earlier this evening and my 20mg Citalopram right before I close my eyes! So far I feel fine except I did realize when I drink coffee on an empty stomach I get very tired and once I eat I fell fine again. I haven't had any major irritability, stress or anxiety since taking this but still a few weird and uncomfortable thoughts, which is mild for my incredibly over active brain. I am also having hot/cold flashes but it isn't that bothersome. So far, so good.  It has also completely curbed my nicotine urge which is fantastic since I was on my 11 attempt to quit.

"I have had anxiety that was completely out of control.  I worried so much that I couldn't enjoy life because I was too busy worrying about what horrible thing might be getting ready to happen.  I would have panic attacks at night that were so bad it felt as if I was on fire, the day time panic attacks were not as bad as the ones at night, but still were bad enough.  I'm not really sure why I was hesitant to take something, but my doctor told me all this medicine would do is turn off the noise in my head.  I started out on 10 mg, then changed to 20 mg after a week.  I could tell a difference in that I wasn't worrying as much, but the anxiety was still there lurking, and still bad at night.  He increased my dosage to 40 mg and everything has been much better.  I don't feel any different except that I am not worring myself sick.  Now my worries and controllable and rational.  This medicine has made a huge positive change in my life.  As for side effects, I was very sleepy when I began taking it, but after about a month and a half it's not very bad.  I sleep well, no problem there.  I have a bit of dry mouth, but I just dring more water which is better for me anyway.  The side effects are so minimal and the medicine works great.

In retrospect, I discovered that I have been depressed most of my life. After hitting a major low, I asked my doctor for help, and he prescribed Celexa (Citalopram).

The only ""negative"" side effect is extremely low sex drive (on a scale of 1 to 10, about 0.5). However, considering how life is now worth living, I hardly even care! You probably can't understand unless you've experienced it...

For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast.

"I started taking Celexa for major panic attacks that flipped my life upside-down. I took the medication and it helped me for the first few months, but after about 2 months on Celexa it started to effect other parts of my life. Sex was not an option, it took away any desire I had, and when I did my mind wasn't there. I began to find myself zoning off for long periods of time, feeling like a droid. I decided I didn't want to be on it and told my doctor, she asked if I still battled with my anxiety and panic disorder and I told her it was still present but not as bad. She decided it was time to up my dose to 40 milligrams. I took the 40 MG for about 2 months and the zoning out and zombied out feeling was still there, I couldn't be intimate, and I decided to go off the medication without notifying my doctor. I stopped taking it cold turkey and experienced major brain spaces, periods of time where I couldn't think, almost like my brain was having a seizure. I would get light headed and felt sick, and had emotional break downs and vivid horrible dreams for a while. I decided I should taper off the medication, took my 20 MG instead of 40 and slowly stopped taking it. I am doing well, am not battling with myself anymore and I can think straight for the first time in almost a year.

Never, ever try it this way. I have since then been fired him. My main advice for those attempting withdrawal is to do so in a gradual, well-managed way. Keep a record as to when you start, how you feel day by day, any unusual occurrences.

I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read).

The Dr put me on this becuase of the motivation.  I was worried that taking and Ati Depression drug was not what I needed but she told me to give it a fair shot.  I am more motivated.  Sleeping habits we back in place in about a week or two.  I am very happy with this medication though I do forget to take it a bit.  This hasnt seemed to effect me though.

"I started taking this medication at 20mg with 75mg of amitriptyline at night to combat depression and anxiety. After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.",5/1/2011 1:17:48 PM,citalopram oral,3.0,4.0,3.0

Once all this was cleared, many lesions were found on the wall of the stomach and esophagus. He also had a herpes virus.  Due to his age (88) he could not survive the loss of so much blood.

It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy.

I know it is going to take a little bit of time for it to completely start working but so far I am happy with the results will be happier once the tiredness goes away.

This drug has made me feel a lot better.  Have problems with depression and also agitation/anger issues.  Since I have been taking this medication I don't fly off the handle like I use to and I don't just sit around in a blah state of mind. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy but I had rather deal with being sleepy than snapping at my loved ones in anger and being depressed.  Also before I started this medication I constantly woke up every 2 or 3 hours and I could never remember my dreams but now I sleep through the night and I can remember my dreams. My dreams are really random and vivid.  Overall I feel much better especially when I go to bed at a reasonable hour and get plenty of sleep.

"I have been taking this generic form of Celexa for ten years, next month. I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. 

Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. 

Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

"I took this medication for a year to treat anxiety/depression issues. The drug seemed to work for the first few months I was on it, but eventually the drawbacks began to outweigh the posities. The drug significantly lowered my libido. It also led to a somewhat unreal feeling of constant happiness and satisfaction.
I eventually felt that the drug wasn't really helping me with my problems. It was covering them up, ineffectively at that.
I found that talking to a therapist was the most effective way to treat my disorder, and I strongly discourage potential users from simply taking a drug to try and cope.
Many doctors are eager to overprescribe drugs and just hope that the problem will go away. It won't. Upping the dosage will not force you to treat the source of these problems.
Personally, while I think that the drug helped me get through a difficult time in my life, I don't think that it's worth losing yourself in the process.
Mental pain, like physical, is indicative that something is wrong. When we treat a physical ailment we don't just treat the symptom; we treat the cause.

"I really like this medication for a couple of reasons: it's milder than a 10 mg Lexapro, it's not expensive, it decreases any unnecessary feeling of guilt, and I haven't had an anxiety attack while on it. Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat ""twitchy."" There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  
Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis. My last discrepancy with this medication is a mild inattentiveness during conversation and daily tasks.

I'm overall a happy person, but I no longer feel the need to be social anymore.  The only person I really spend my time with anymore is my boyfriend.  Really, I don't even mind not social, its the weight gain that I don't like. I have gained over 50 pounds since I started taking the medication.

Now i know the labido is a side affect but not sure about the memory loss. Oh and im more tired then usual but dont sleep well. I have continued to take this mostly because of the mood swings. I am 43 years old and have 2 children in high school and dont want them to remember me as a witch going through my change. It has also helped tremendesly with my husbands and my relationship.I think he was just about at his end with my picking all the time.

"Doctor prescribed after going to the hospital 3 times for chest tightness and pain in the sternum area...after ruling out all serious conditions the only thing they could find was a Hiatel hernia with acid refux which I constantly worried about so he started me on Xanax .5mg 4 times a day and 20mg of citalopram once a day. I stopped worrying but did have side effects once I stopped the xanax that included dry mouth, heavy sweating in arm pits, blurred vision in left eye, tingle sensations in hands and feet, pounding heart beat which would pulse in head as I slept at night, dizziness, lightheaded, and decreased sexual sensation. (could climax just take longer..too long) also felt tired throughout the day even after stopping the xanax so I switched to taking at night which helped. side effects improved or I got used to them and continued taking for 5 months but never really felt like I needed it as I was still having my original problem and once convinced it was not something serious I felt like I could handle things without drugs so I tapered off too 10mg for two weeks then stopped. (doctor wanted me to stay on it until December) On about day 4 of stopping I started feeling severe lightheadedness almost feel kinda drunk and it has not stopped yet (7th day) I have considered taking xanax again until this stops but have not yet (been toughing it out) very scaring feeling wish I never took this drug and just want to feel normal again.

I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)

Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.

"THis is an Update to an earlier post: 
I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. 
The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.

"Also wanted to add to my previous post that it took several weeks for me to feel the full effects of this drug. Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started.
 Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out.",10/17/2008 12:03:55 AM,citalopram oral,5.0,5.0,4.0

"I LOVE this medication.  It works so well for me.  For about 10 years I've been dealing with depression and panic/anxiety order.  For years I tried everything to not have to take meds - stress management class, relaxation therapy, exercise, meditation, you name it.  Finally, I ""gave in"" and decided I couldn't fight on my own anymore.  The first week was pretty awful.  I felt drunk all the time.  Couldn't drive and had a tough time at work.  Then one day, my mind was clear!!!  Seriously clear!  Like I could actually focus.  The sense of being overwhlemed was gone.  It's been about 4 years.  Sometimes I come off it for 2-3 months just to give my boday a break (no one ever told me to do that, I just do.  Each time, the withdrawal is the same as when I first started taking it.  The dizzy drunkness.  It usually takes me just 2 months to remember why I went on it in the first place.  It's an awesome drug.  Doesn't interfere with my life at all.  I still get happy, sad, scared, excited.  I'm just able to focus so much better and take one thing at a time.  I've been married for 5 years now and will be starting a family soon.  I really don't want to have to come off while pregnant or breastfeeding.....
