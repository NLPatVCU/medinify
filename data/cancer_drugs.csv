"15 months ago at 73, I was diagnosed with a PSA of 925 and a Gleason score of 9 left side 7 right side.The disease had spread to my lymphatic system, but not to my bones, liver or kidneys.  I was prescribed Prednisolone/Aberiterone treatment in parallel with standard treatment my PSa has dramatically reduced in a smooth curve and now have a PSA of 0.6 I am told that this is not a cure and am being monitored monthly. I am healthier, with the only side effects being the 'sweats', usually after eating and drinking. I am cycling, walking and gardening a large garden.",5
"After taking zytiga for 3 months I developed dry mouth, lost 22 pounds, increased urination, dry skin,  However, it did lower my PSA but not worth what I am experiencing after being off it four month.  ",5
Have to take it with food since pills are to difficult to swallow they get caught in my throat,5
"Breast cancer that spread first to my brain.  then recurred in my brain and both lung, this is when my doctor treated me with abracene.  I have been in remission for nearly 5 years now. I'm BRCA positive and have had bilateral br ca, so I've had a lot of chemo.  I have periph neuropathy, headaches.  But I'm alive!!!  I have a son with a debate disability and these last 5 years have made a huge impact on his life because I was here to help him.  Joint pain during trtmt, and neuropathy.  Xeloda with radiation to my brain for the brain meta. Thank you Abraxane, I believe you saved my life.",5
"Completed my 10th treatment. 3 weeks on 1 week off. Mild side effects including hair loss, fatigue, metallic taste, constipation week of treatment which I use Merrulax for. Stool softners were not effective. Good nutrition and hydrating is very important. Cancer markers have all decreased and recent PET scan showed significant improvement.",4
I received about 6 months of treatment; mostly 3 Fridays in a row and 1 week off.  I have now started to experience some numbness and pain in my fingertips and toes. A CT scan now shows that lesions in the liver have increased in size and a couple new ones; other areas stable. So I will be switching to eribulin.,4
"Tomorrow I receive my 3rd week of treatment of my second round (3 Fridays in a row, then a week off).  I have had minimal side effects so far; some minor fatigue, hair started to thin out so I got it shaved and got a wig, but there is still hair there!  The steroid that I get right before my IV treatment causes some sleeplessness that night after treatment.  Can't really speak to effectiveness right now as we've not measured the cancer antigen or done a scan since I switched to Abraxane.",3
Moms 2nd round of 3wks Bone pain this dose. No Steroid given d/t mouth sores and skin sores during 1st round. ,3
Just going to start it.,3
I have had 15 abraxane treatments and tolerated them very well. The only side effect was very thin hair. My cancer antigen numbers keep going up on abraxane so my doctor is switching me to another chemo therapy. ,3
"Stage IV IBC/TNEG - Spread in both lungs.  I have had excellent results; thin hair which I shaved. No other side effects at all, but steriods are causing weight gain.  Finishing 3rd round (3 weeks on/1 off). IBC significantly reduced and not visible; reduction to lymph nodes, all 3 breast tumors reduced to 1/4 of size, lung lesions reducing.  Very satisfied with treatment. ",5
"My husband almost had 2 cycles but could not take this. His white blood count went very low and will probably have to stop it.  He is very tired, hair loss, aches in legs and feet and some nausea and stomach cramps.  I thought it would be good but I think he should come off of it.  He will get a scan next week.",3
"Overall, I've had some nausea, extreme fatigue, and numbing in my lips and lower face.  My cancer markers have gone up but I've only been on the drug for 1 month. I'll write another review after a few months. ",4
"I too had mets to the bone and liver, had TAC first time round, definitely a lot easier than before. Three weeks on 1 week off, just finished third week of third month and am having two very much needed weeks off. WCC very low probably due to lack of sleep caused by menopause, haven't wanted to use sleeping pills but think the benefit of sleep is greater than the loss of acid gain. No nausea at all, hair thinning, blood nose third week of each cycle too. Had my first lots of scans after the first weeks of third month and significant tumour reductions, hope to have no more than five months on treatment.",4
"I read all the horror stories about the possible side effects of Abraxane but after 2 months I have expereinced very few. My hair has thinned. I feel some fatigue but getting up and moving around makes it go away. I am doing 3 weeks on and 1 off. the first 2 weeks are pretty easy the third I get some tingling in my fingertips. The most pronounced effects are the day after the infusion I feel as if my hair has been cut and the pieces of cut hair are itching me, strange feeling. My tumor markes dropped 500 points after 2 infusions so it sure seems to be working. Fluids are terribly important drink until you think you can't hold anymore. Just think of it as water goes in chemo comes out. Stool softener never did a thing for me so my med team said to take senna a natural vegetable laxative - worked like a charm.I asked my med team if I would get those bad side effects and they replied that if I didn't after the first two infusions that no I wouldn't. One word of wisdom: don't sit around in a chemo haze make yourself get up and move around and that haze/fatigue will fade away. I'm stage IV with mets to the bones and liver. Abraxane is do able and I am able to enjoy life so much more. Good luck to all and stay positive.",4
"I agree with the other person that said take a stool softener two days before the treatment.It would have been nice if I had read this before embarking on the abraxane journey. The antacids are important the first three days after the treatment. The acid is bad.Now I have that awful rash on my hands and forearms after month three of the treatment.No hair is not a biggie. Been to that style before.Month three kills the taste buds worse than month one and two .besides that, there  is an awful metallic taste to deal with too. Oh yes lets not forget the bloody nose at the most inopportune moments .Tiredness is mild compared to the first round of chemo .It's very tolerable .I still need a scan to determine how much more chemo I need .I'm grateful that there are meds to keep me alive even if they don't allow me to feel my best.Bottom line.... I am still alive.",4
abdominal pain,4
" I am starting my 5th month of treatment{every Friday for 3 weeks then 1 week off).  My CT scan is showing complete reduction in my lympnods and drastic reduction in the size of the tumors in my liver. My worse side-effects are complete hairloss, numbness of fingers, toes and lips/face and fatigue. I also get a rash(like eczema) on my hands and shortness of breath for a week after the 3rd week of treatment. However, I consider these minor due the effectiveness of tumor reductions.",5
"i have experience pain in my bones, ringing in my ears, blisters on my hands and sinus problems, including nose bleeding. My CA125 numbers have come down significantly.",5
"I was diagnosed last June with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, with mets to lymph nodes. The oncologist described his oncology plan for me as, ""more treatments, less toxicity."" I received weekly treatments of abraxane for twelve weeks. I was sick the entire time and in horrible pain.  I ran a fever and showed signs of congestive heart failure. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with me other than not wanting to finish the chemo.  The effectiveness was great, but I have permanent nerve damage, pain, and neuropathy caused by this drug.  I was never told that could happen. I would have made different choices. ",5
"Bilateral breast cancer with bone met.  Today is 10 months the cancer is dormant.  Bone, CT & PET scans since November are dormant (no lighted areas)",5
Drink lots of tea or water before during and after treatment. Take a pain relief and stool softner two days before treatment. Take an antacid gas relief if needed the 2nd night after treatment if needed.,5
I had stage4 breast cancer with severe bone mets.  After 6 mos of Abraxine my cancer does not show up on any CT/PET scan.  I have been cancer free for 4 mos.,5
I have ovarian cancer. I was allergic to the other taxel meds. I am not allergic to abraxane and it is bringing my ca 125 down. I also have severe neuropathy in my hands and feet but am tolerating it.,5
"I finished my Abraxane treatment a little over 1 year ago. I still have severe numbness and swelling in my hands and legs. I also had substantial vision loss almost immediately after my first treatment. I was in terrible pain during the treatment. I think that the prescribing physician should tell people that it will age you 20 years, on the spot, and you will never be the same. My doctor tried this drug on 2 patients. We both had the same complaints. He said that he will never use it again. It is a HORRIBLE drug.",4
"other taxols did not work for my ovarian cancer, abraxane is bringing  my ca-125 down",5
"Does anyone have any information on how long the side effects last? Or the severity? While I have gotten some relief I'm only up to my 3rd dose, the exhaustion is almost unbearable.  No one seems to be able to give any information on how long or how severe the side effects stay with you.",2
"I have been on this medicine for five years now.  When I first started out on this medication It worked great, as time went by I experience real bad flare ups; shoulder, neck, back , knee and ankle pains. Injection sight bruising, rashâ?¦. When was so bad once you scratch it then you have a mark for life.  Wait canâ??t leave out the bad headaches and fatigue. I am hoping that the company is reading the comments",2
"I've had flare ups with shoulders, neck and back pains. I have noticed that I have more bruising and spots on my body if I have an itch and scratch it, it leaves a mark that doesn't go away. I have been on this medication two years, and ready to get off. ",3
"I've been on this med for five months, and it is working well. I started out taking it every other week for two months. It was mildly working so the doc increased it to every week. I haven't had another flare up, and my stiffness and achiness is much improved. I had tried Enbrel first, but it lowered my immunity so much that I was sick all winter. Then I tried Orencia, but there was no improvement. I'm still on sulfasalazine, prednisone, Tylenol RA and tramadol, but I hope if the biologic continues to work that I can lower or discontinue some of the pills. It's not a miracle drug - I still have pain and stiffness in my shoulders and back, but at least I can get out of bed without crying from the pain and I can use my hands again! Nothing works for everybody, so just make sure you have a good doctor and keep trying!",4
"It took 3 months for Actemra subcutaneous to provde full effect. At that point, symptoms were relieved and have not returned. Have taken this medication alone for 16 weeks. No injection site pain or brusing and no side effects. Have tried Methatrexate, Plaquanil, Humira and Enbrel but had to discontinue all of them due to serious side effects.   Difficult for me to administer alone since it is a needle with plunger. I need help to do this because it takes two hands. Hope the manufacturer will package it as a SureClick very soon. Many more people would be able to use it.",5
"The first few doses seemed to have little effect, but by the fourth or fifth, I noticed a nice improvement. No injection sight reactions or headache. Regular lab work required to check cholesterol levels. Swelling greatly reduced, but still experiencing mild to moderate pain. No flares since starting.",4
It makes me feel timid and scared. it is helping my knees.I have fatique and minor headaches and a rash. something a little better I hope will come along.  There is no money in cures. ,4
"Have only had 3 of the subq injections, 1 every 2 weeks. Do not think I will continue. Have had severe flares after each injection, along with fatigue. Had fewer flares before starting this med.",1
I am a 65 year old female and have been on Actemra by IV for 2years now. This drug has worked awesome for me. Can now lift my arms and walk longer with no pain. Beside mild side effects like sinus pain and mild skin itching Actemra has changed my quality of life for the better. Hope it last longer then the Humira and Simponi ,5
i have an artery inflammatory disease that steroids failed to reduce the inflamation,5
"WOW, I've been on many biologics and after the first infusion I'm almost back to my normal self!  I hope my body does not build immunity to this one as it has the others.  It feels so awesome to feel normal!  I had no reaction to the infusion.  I've had RA since 2014.  My case is considered severe.  I've been on Steroids for over a year and able to get off them with the Acterma.  I've have tried Methotrexate injections, after a year had to stop those and they were not affective for me.  I've tried Orencia, Embrel, Humira and Plaquenil. ",5
I have been on every possible drug and drug combination prior to starting Actemra with no success.  Since starting on Actemra I have been pain/Inflammation free and in remission.  My doctor has also pushed back my infusions from every 4 weeks to every 6 weeks since it seems to be the drug that finally worked for me ,5
"OK, not to brag but I've been on Actemra for 4 1/2 years and for the last 2 years, I've been in total remission!  Now I pump weights 5 days a week and we walk or hike nearly every day of the week, which (I'm sure) helps.  After several years of unsuccessful solutions, Actemra works for me! ",5
"Failed Enbrel and methotrexate, had Vectra test revealing high RA disease activity with Interleukin 6 as culprit.  Started Actemra self injections.  After 6th injection, I had improvement in joint pain, stiffness and fatigue.  It continues to work.  Only side effect has been an occasional mild headache.  The Vectra test and Actemra have changed my life!",5
"I have been on Actemra IV for five months. There hasn't been any reduction in my RA symptoms. I have experienced increased joint pain after my infusion and Actemra has caused my blood pressure to skyrocket resulting in two BP med changes, so I will be changing to Rituxamab. ",1
I was initially on the clinical trial for three years.  I am now in my sixth year.  It has been a miracle for me.  I was unable to raise my arms for years.  Now I can with relative ease.  ,5
"Actemra is almost a life saver for me. It has given me my life back. Before Actemra I didn't have any energy to do anything after working my job all day. I needed 12 to 14 hours of sleep just to feel rested, which can't be done and work full time. All I did was go home after work, eat supper and go to bed. On my days off at best I would accomplish one minor activity before having to stop for the day. And the RA was spreading from my fingers, hands and wrists to my toes. Always in some amount of pain even taking a 24 hour prescription pain med.  Now I've been using Actemra for a few months and I have energy again. A lot of times I feel nearly normal. It's wonderful to have my life back.  I am grateful for Actemra.",5
I was diagnosed with RA 40 years ago so have tried a lot of different treatments.  This is my second biologic.  This drug has been completely ineffective and I am experiencing a level of inflammation that I haven't seen in at least 20 years.  I had a terrible time getting the drug from the drug company and it wasn't until my rheumatologist stepped in that I was able to fill the prescription.  I am counting the days until my next appointment so that I can get off this terrible drug.  ,1
"This has been life changing for me. Nothing else has worked. Combinations, methotrexate none of them helped. Have some hair loss but methotrexate started this. Weight gain possibly but I feel that the Actemra makes you feel so much better that you start feeling normal again and blow the diet out the window!So whether y weight gain can be attributed to it I don't think so as I now eat more than before it. Still some niggly aches but nothing like what I had before. Have removed myself from prednisolone and the actemra is all I have now. So very successful. I pray it keeps working.",5
"My daughter has had arthritis since 4th grade, and nothing but cortisone shots ever helped her UNTIL ACTEMRA. She has been getting infusion for almost a year now. All her joints are affected with arthritis, except her back. She was told she would have to have a hip replacement by the time she was 18. She is 17, and doing AMAZING because of ACTEMRA!! Her doctor just smiles at each visit and shakes his head in amazement, because it is like she is healed! Her range of motion is normal now! We are so happy:) Finally, after all these years, they found what works for her. We tried methotrexate, Enbrel, Orencia, but nothing helped. Enbrel actually made her worse. It locked her joints up. I hope more people will get to try ACTEMRA and it will help them, also. A nurse that was involved in a pediatric study of ACTEMRA told me that when it works, it works VERY WELL, and she has seen the miracle of children in wheelchairs able to walk:) I believe it!",5
I have my stiffness/pain gone and range of motion  back. feel fuctioning again. I am currently needing a dose (3 weeks late - going on 4),5
"When biologics failed me after only 2 years I chose Actemra because of the few side effects.  Other than a headache and sometimes fatigue the day of the infusion and my cholesterol slowly creeping up I have virtually no side effects and my RA is pretty well controlled.  It definitely compromises your immune system so you must be vigilant, but compared to previous drugs' side effects and looking at my quality of life, I'm very pleased.",5
"After serveral years on many different biologic's with no success. Actemra has been AWESOME! Other than usual morning stiffness, most symptoms has been resolved.",5
"Started Actemra after spending 2 years cycling through most biologic meds commonly prescribed for RA- Humira, Simponi, Enbrel, Orencia- which had no effect. 6 months in with Actemra infusion and I am feeling very good. I cannot recommend this enough for those suffering with systemic on-set juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This has completely taken away my rash and fevers, and helped tremendously with the pain and swelling. Of course still have bad days, but overall am very pleased with Actemra. ",5
"Cannot say enough good things about this drug. Where nothing else worked (embril, humera, metho, symponi, and of course prednisone) actemra has truly put things back to normal. Going in for the infusions is a pain, but completely worth it. I went from barely being able to walk at 29yrs to being very active at 31 and even going for multi mile runs! No side effects as far as I can tell, maybe sleeping extra soundly the day of the infusion. ",5
"Started with JRA at 2yrs old about 31 years ago. Today I am still fighting the activity and pain from destroyed joints. Back when I was younger they would give aspirin and gold, and today I am paying for it. Every time a new drug would come out I would go on it. It resulted in either bad side effects or lack of effectiveness. Taking prednisone most of my life has killed my body, so I'm forced to be on a lower dose. I can no longer walk and am at the mercy of my loved ones. So when you add everything up, along with other diseases I've picked up over the years, it is hard to judge what is doing what. The only thing I can go by is how I feel! So, on actemra, at the beginning I felt some relief in my neck and ankles. I was hoping that it just needed more time to accumulate in my body. I was wrong. It didn't get any better. In fact, I never needed a calender to tell me my next infusion date because my body did it for me. Around a week before infusion time I would get so achy, and could not get out of bed. The only great thing about Actemra was the lack of severe side effects. I mean of course, their are always side effects, it's part of life when on RA drugs! However, the only side effect I had was being extremely tired after the infusion. So, in result, I totally wrote too much that no one will ever read! I just wanted you to understand that this is my story with Actemra. My story, my body! Just because it didn't work for me does not mean the same for you. We all have taken different paths with our disease... Maybe this path is right for you! ",2
"Countless failed medications and unbearable side effects .Going off and on  for surgery s did not help .Bed ridden ,depressed, no quality of life .Six yrs of  this .Its hard to be a nice person   the old me was gone . Then  came my miracle Actemra Iv. No one likes  having to go every month for Iv but it sure has changed my life I can be grandma again.I can dress myself put make up on,comb my hair, cook,clean  although at times I overdo the walking in malls thing Im so happy most of all  my surgeries can be worked around the  date so I do not have to  go off  them .The nurse @ staff where I go for the Iv  are very professional  I feel very safe. A new lease on life  here,s hoping for the best. ",5
"Diagnosed with RA recently but have been actually living with it for many many years and untreated until my hands were starting to cramp and become disfigured I had to do something and also the fatigue was making me a zombie daily and the pain was overwhelming.  Methotraxate made me more ill and coma like, Sulfasalize didn't help at all and gave me rashes, but Actemra has been making me like new after my first dose.  I was nervous about taking it because I suffer from alot of severe sinus infections due to my immune system attacking me instead of the real bacteria or viruses but my infections are completely gone now and I am also on Bactrim DS as a co-drug. I have energy like I was 15 and my feet and ankles and hips and neck and elbows and hands and back all affected are so much better and I actually can climb stairs without pain!  I hope I can keep from getting any of the other side effects such as high liver enyzemes as I imagine I would be on this drug for awhile .... :)",5
"Updating my post of 11/25/13. Did more research and discovered that the unacceptable side effects are not caused by the Arava. They are from the Actemra. 4 weeks from first injection I have severe blistering boils on several places that are taking 3X as long to heal as regular boils. I also have a rash on my face now. These are completely unacceptable side effects for a drug that has done nothing for the pain. I do realize that many RA drugs take ~12 weeks for full effect, but practically zero effect plus the intense pain and the awful side effects = not for me. I will be petitioning my doctor to put me back on Enbrel. It wasn't the best, but it helped enough to get me through the day with pain I could handle.",1
"first dose 3 weeks ago because Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, Orencia, Xeljanz no longer work. Took methylprednisolone for 3 straight months, which helped somewhat. Was on methotrexate, but it caused cluster migraines and vomiting. Tried Arava but it caused severe blistering boils. Tossed it 2 weeks ago but still getting that side effect. Not Happy. The Actemra decreased my sed rate to single digits--first time in 14 years. But the pain is so severe I'm now on Loritabs just to get out of bed in the morning. It's like the only effect of Actemra is the sed rate. I'm gong to try to put up with it for at least 2 more doses, but I cannot tolerate this level of constant pain. I'll make my doctor switch me back to Enbrel, because with that the pain and swelling were somewhat tolerable with the methyl and now that I have the Loritabs. Will update this review or add a new one if things change.",1
Has anyone had a problem with hair loss?,4
"Going on 9 months of using Actemra for RA.. It has worked extremely well for me! No joint swelling and back to normal walking (daily).  Prior to Actemra, I spent a year with Enbrel/ Methotrexate, which was 50% effective, but gave me side effects (nasty rash and bowel problems).  With Actemra I feel like I'm in total remission! ",5
"Was taking this for over 4 yrs (2 of which was case study) and after too many bad side affects from too many oral meds, was amazed by the GREAT results of Actemra.  Had to stop over a year ago: gastro-intestinal problem....had 2' of intestine removed after it burst.  Under side effects, this is a possibility when taken w/Methotrexate...""may aggravate diverticula, and penetrate stomach wall or intestine"", which it did, apparently  Had terrible abdominal pains Mar - Oct till I had surgery.  Since starting drug, have had two fractured vertebrae, and am experiencing some atrophy in my feet.  I am afraid to take anything now!  I was fatigued, was 'cold' even in 70 degree weather, not to mention raised colesterol, liver count, and immune system compromised.  If it works for you, great, but I can't begin to afford what it costs after insurance.  I'm still paying for 2011 services!!!",5
"I started this drug in may of 2013. I have had to joint pain or inflammation. I was in Constance pain . I have used every thing. Remicade, humaria two different injection type drugs . I have had rheumatoid arthritis for 20 years.",5
Doesn't last the month  .  First week and half works great. But doesn't stop more damage joints,3
Doesn't seem to be helping. Liver enzymes high. Dr. canceled last infusion. Now in limbo.,2
try many other meds that didn't help me.this new meds actemra has really help.,4
I have been on this drug for 17 mths. I have infusions every 21 days and it has giving me my life back. I no longer have to take metotrexate or predisone. I have a little bit of stiffness and pain a couple of days before treatment and my skin on my arms is thinning but other than that no problems,5
"I have had RA for 28 years now and have been on most of the drugs asvailable.  Nothing lasted very long until I entered a trial for Actemra about four years ago.  I have been on it ever since and it has been great.  I do notice that I am stiff the week I am due for the I/V and would probably benefit from more frequent infusions, although I don't think that is possible on our health scheme. ",5
"Ihave been an actemra for 6 years, It has helped more than any drug. I don't take anything else for RA.",5
"Getting my 6th infusion tomorrow - so far no results. In last 2 months had 2 major flares. On Prednisone with sliding doses since dx 6 1/2 yrs ago. Had 3 doses of Rituxin, then Orencia, which was great, until it stopped working last year. Can' take DMARDS, had reactions to all of them! Same with mthx. I'm getting very depressed - any suggestions??",1
well after my seventh infusion this also stopped working for me. only one good week. bummer going to start the new JAK inhibitor soon. fingers crossed this works.    ,1
"I have had RA for 13 years, been on all the other drugs.  Being an RN am very cautious about new meds, but have had cancer 4 times as well so, 2 and a half years ago went on Actemra (along with MTX and Leflunomide...no NSAIDS as I required 4 units of blood from a clotting disorder related to them after using for all those years!)...this drug is a miracle.  I have had no side effects and my Rheumatologist prescribes it to me every 21 days so I don't have that week of hell the 7 days before my next infusion.  THIS drug saved my life!",5
"I was introduced to Actemra by my Rheumatologist who put me in a 5-year study.  Now, 2 years after my participation in the study came to an end, I get monthly infusions at my rheumatologist's office.  This drug has been amazing for me -- I rarely need even Tylenol for pain.   The last week prior to my next infusion I get a little stiff and sore, but nothing unmanageble.  I had large nodules on both elbows -- which totally disappared after 7 or 8 infusions!",5
I have had seven treatments so far. It has worked very well. No side effects. ,5
"I've had infusions for RA for years when my doctor suggested Actemra. It's the only time I've felt a drug for RA while it was going into my body. Right before finishing, I got a bad headache. I had severe headaches daily for the next month. Towards the end of the month, I was watching a movie when my blood pressure went through the roof and one arm started flailing uncontrollably. I went to the ER until my BP went down and my arm settled-a visit that cost me $2,500 out of pocket. I've had uncontrollable shaking in that same arm and my R foot three times since then, the most recent being last week. I wouldn't take the drug again if I was paid to do it!",1
"I have been on actemra for 4 months now with what seems like litle benefit but last week before my treatment I am in terrible pain and lots of swelling in my arms and hands.  So it may be doing something but not enough.  Ive been on remicade, orencia and humira and with and without MTX which provided either little relief or develoed severe allergic reactions.",3
I have been on this for only 3 months so im waiting for results.,2
"I have just had my 25th infusion and am delighted with the results, because I have my life back! I do notice that the week before the infusion is due I am very well aware that the effectiveness has worn off. I have had a reduced dosage the last two infusions due to a slightly raised liver function test. I am hopeful of having a full dosage again next time. ",5
"My 4.5 year old daughter has been receiving Actemra infusions since February 15, 2012.  She has needed a very large dose (30 mg/kg) to bring her systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis under control and thus far, while the Actemra is helping her systemic symptoms, her joints remain very affected by arthritis. She has had injections of cortisone into her joints twice in an attempt to help. The only thing that truly helps her arthritis is high-dose prednisolone, which is not something we can safely keep her on.    Her rheumatologist told me this past Wednesday (Aug 22, 2012) that there are some people who get relief of systemic symptoms but no real relief of arthritis while on Actemra. Unfortunately, my daughter falls into that category.  Her doctor & I will be discussing long-term treatment options next week. I don't know if she will continue with Actemra or not.  Her arthritis is extremely debilitating ~ she does not use her hands at all, cannot walk and experiences pain every day.  Actemra has helped make it possible to get her off of prednisolone without having a major flare-up, but it is not actually helping with her arthritis (just the systemic symptoms).",3
I am 37 years old i have been on this medication for a year now its working for me I was scared at first i had GI problems the first 3 infusions but that has went away if I miss one infusion I feel all the pain worse than prior to using this med so if your on tis medication dont stop you will have terrible pain and stiffness and at that i was only a week late getting my infusion due to high blood pressure I also take 5mg of prednisone daily with this infusion my bones feel great and im back at work part time te only problem i have with this is spikeing blood pressure but i now take norvasc 5mg daily for that and my blood pressure is back to normal i get alot of heart burn but i take tums for that dont give up on this medication it really does help it has helped me and ive had RA since I was 16 years old The Gi pain does go away ,5
"Been taking about one year, have no side effects other than if I get a cold it seems to take longer to rid, I believe it has helped quite a bit with mobility and swelling of joints. It does not seem to help me have any pain relief so I still take morphine for pain. I have found it works better with prednisone however other patients say it does relieve pain for them. It is a pain to have to go every month and get the injection but have tried all the other injectibles and this seems to work better so will continue until something better comes along. For those of you who have said no insurance, contact the maker they have a program to furnish free in most cases. I was getting it free until I got on medicare. Now it is 4800.00 a month, no wonder the government is broke. :)",3
"My disease (GCA) and the prednisone it is treated with are slowly eating away at me. I've been on 100-45 mgs. pred for 20 months while using methotrexate and Enbrel in an effort to use less pred. In the last 7 months I have relapsed every time I have tried to taper. GCA will kill me quick and prednisone will kill me slow. Already got diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, ect. from it. Actemra has to work!",5
so far it has worked for the pain.  time will tell,4
I have only had 1 infusion 2 weeks ago.  I had quite a bit of GI problems for the first couple days.  I also had a severe headache that lasted about 4 days.  I need feed back/replies on emotional outburst.  I have cried more than not since my infusion and need to know if anyone else has expeirenced this or if it is caused from something else.,2
"I have been takeing it about 4 monyhs ,now i have no insurencss ,what can i do .",5
i have had trouble with upset stomach and feeling sick most of time.,4
Nine year old daughter no symptoms. Some loss of appetite. Love thus drug. Anxious for it to be in injection format. Next year!,5
"First drug to work for me and have been on it for a year now. But, the side effects are mounting and I feel as though I  may have to stop it. Have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low blood count, low potassium, and my skin is so thin that it just peels off. Breaks my heart because RA is better. ",5
"I have severe RA and was diagnosed over 8 years ago. Tried everything from prednisone to plaque nil to methotrexate. Participated in a clinical trial for this drug and by the end of year one I literally forgot I had RA. All morning stiffness disappeared, and on occasion minor aches appeared in my hands and a shoulder now and then. This drug Was amazing. I was extended on the drug and did a lasting 5 year study. Never had one side effect. All organs are fine. But sadly now, my trial ended in June 2011 and slowly I have started feeling pain again...I have no insurance so I'm not sure what to do now. ",5
I think this Biological drug is working.,3
"I've been on Actemra for 7 months.  Had several bouts of bronchitis the first few months, but I have notice a big difference in stiffness and I have more energy.  Like so many others, I know I need an infusion about a week before.  I am taking this with oral mtx.",3
"I have been on Actemra now for two months.  This month it wore off a week or two early.  I am going to go to the double dose 8mg/kg now.  No side effects at all and feel much better right away.  Hoping the increased dose will make it last the full four weeks.  Was on Remicade, then Orencia before, both of those wore off and quit working at all",4
It has decrease the pain on my right knee.I can now go up and down the stairs without help from anybody.I can now drive the car again.,4
I've been a RA patient for about 6 years and have tried many injectables and infusion type meds. When first started on Actemra I was pain free for about two months BUT than it just quit working and I've not found relief since. Still looking still wondering when I'll have my life back.,4
I was in the test program got this drug and have only had good results. I  am not taking methotrexate with it an am tapering off of naproxin unless there is constant pain.,5
"I had been on Enbrel for years with great success but alas, it wore off and I was in terrible shape.  After a tremendous battle with my insurance, my doctor got me on Actemra.  First two doses - nothing.  Then he doubled my dose.  It began to show some signs of promise.  Now after five infusions at the higher dose I can say it really is working.    I had a huge nodule in my left wrist that is gone and swellings all over are down.  I could hardly get in and out of a chair my knees were so bad and now I'm doing yoga again.  My bicept tendinitis is greatly reduced, too.  My only complaint is a tremendous headache the day after infusion, but it's a small price to pay for 4 weeks of feeling almost normal.  I've reduced Prednisone and Methotrexate, too.  I noticed some hair loss at first but it is resolving now.  No cholesterol problems for me, no rashes, etc.  Just the headache and that goes away in a day or two.  Other than that, having to take time away from work for the infusion is a PAIN.  I've read on the web that they're working on self inject Actemra and that would be awesome!",5
"Actemra has been so good to me! I have been on it for 8 months now and have felt the best i have in a long time. I am also on methotrexate injections, they seem to work really well together. I have tried so many medicines with no success so i am very excited about this. I can tell the week before i need a treatment, but my pain is tolerable. LOVE IT!",5
"Hello, I have severe RA and was hospitalized for a month and could not walk at all and barely use my hands. My dr started me on 8mg/kg of Actemra. I have finished 5 infusions now. It was really after the 3rd infusion that I noticed a big difference.  But still I was not happy and wanted better so my Dr put me back on MTX, a drug that has not worked out for me in the past due to nausea, but this time injections.  And we increased the Actemra to 9mg/kg... yes i know outside the recmnd range.  I have had minimal side effects. Initially my cholestrol went up bit stabilized after the 3rd infusion.  I have soreness and headache for about a day but then i'm good. However I do feel I need it again a week b4 i'm due so my dr has decided to give it to me every 3.5 weeks instead of 4 weeks.  I no longer need any painkillers and can do most things quite comfortably.  I hope it will only get better from here. Please keep in mind like all drugs the body needs time to adjust and side effects and set backs are to be expected so don't be discouraged. A positive attitude will go along way.",4
"I been on this for one month.  Day after receiving treatment, my blood pressure went up, severe headaches, and numbness in fingers. Cancelled all appointments for further infusions of actemra.",3
"12 infusions. The abd distress is worsening. Week after infusion, there is nausea, headache, extreme fatigue. Gastritis and excess acidity, lower GI pain, variable IBS symptoms are tough. Preceeded by Enbrel and Humira. I take mtrx subq weekly but no nsaids. Tough commitment. Sed rate has improved but quality of life still to be determined. I wish there was another choice.",3
"I have been on this drug for the past 5 months after being on Remicade for last 8 years.  I saw a great improvement with energy & flexibility after month 2 but that seems to be dissipating now.  I have had SEVERE hair loss since starting this drug, as well.",4
I have taken it for 5 months and feel like I am much worse than when I started,1
Just had my first dose Yesterday..I pray this works for me.,3
"I was getting the drug as part of the clinical trial. 8mg dose. I felt really good for the first three months; energetic and pain free. After that, I started to struggle with fatigue and, six months later, I was not any better. It also gave me substantially higher Iron levels in my blood. I am a 40 y/o woman that had a hysterectomy one year prior to starting the drug. I ended up stopping the drug when my iron levels were approaching a toxic level, and my RA was not under reasonable control. ",3
I tend to be tired for a few days after treatment.  I have noticed hair loss and I am concerned that it might be from the drug. Wonder if any others havehad this problem.,4
"My first infusion was in November and it was great!  I had been taking remicade but it just quit working after 4 yrs and then I started this! I am really tired first couple of days, then I finally begin to feel pain free and a person again! ",5
"It seems to be working so far, but to early to tell as the other medications started out working and then stopped after several months.  Do have some headaches and tiredness.",4
"Have had 6 treatments over the last 6 months. I have failed to see any major changes in my condition, however, the week before it's due I know it's due. That being said, it must be working to some degree. All in all, it's not a miracle drug but then again, there doesn't seem to be anything better on the market yet. ",2
I have been getting Actemra IV for about 4 years as part of a research study and it has helped me tremendously. I just had my first setback with high Liver count numbers so have to skip my dose this month.,5
"I have been having severe itching on my legs and upper body.  Have severe sores on my hands, elbow and forearm, Also sores on my buttock. I is now32 days since my last infusion, I came down/with pmeumonia.(Recovering) but still have the itching problem.  I WILL NOT take this again. What can I do to rid myself of the ITCHING?",1
this drug has worked very well just had my first set back (low white count) i will have to skip this months infusion,5
"I had 6 treatments once a month for six months. No improvement of my symptoms. My pain got worse. I had severe headaches,vomiting loss of appetite.",1
"First week feel tired, some abd discomfort,fatiqued then have good releif from ra symptoms. week before next dose due I know it is due.",4
"This is by far THE BEST drug I've ever used for my rheumatoid arthritis. For three and a half months - NO PAIN. I can walk without aching feet and ankles. I can begin to swim again. I am a person. I couldn't be more pleased with these result. Never could I have anticipated this. Previously I had been on Remicade, with relief for about 2-3 years. Then Humira for about 18 months. Next came Orencia which lasted hardly at all, followed by Simponi which did nothing. I thought I really had reached the end of the line, but the doctors and nurses etc. at the rheumatology unit, Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, wouldn't let me give up. Cindy said, ""Let's try Actemra"" and told me all about it. Nothing has ever done for me what Actemra has. I work overseas,in remote rural areas and I was in Uganda, May/June. Long hours, long days. No pain.  Unbelievable!",5
"I am 47 and have been on this for 4yrs. This has been such a great help for me. I have been on several other medicines before using this in the drug study and its the only thing that has help me and has brought me so much relief in everyday things. I am so greatful for this and hope to be able to stay in this program. Before starting on this I could hardly walk and the pain was so bad that I stayed at the ER at least once a week. I was unable to sleep and had to have help washing my hair, getting dressed and so many other things that I do by myself now, and have been after a short time of starting this. I hope others can find the relief I have with this. I would tell anyone to try it that has not found something that works for them.I can also say that at this point I have not had any side effects that I am aware of. ",5
"I have tried methotrexate Indomethacine, Prednizone,remicade,orencia and this new drug (on patient trial)  after 4 months helped but Dr. will no long give iv's to medicare patients; so I finally found help and had it slip away from me.",5
"I have Hodgkins Lymphoma and have been being treated for over 13 years. I am now on Adcetris, have had 6 treatments so far. As of my last Ctscans, the cancer cells were shrinking. Hopefully, I will get into remission soon! ",4
"I hate hate hate this drug.  After 2 treatments I had low neutrophil counts and after the 3rd treatment, with 2 weeks off for body to recoup, had even lower neutrophil counts plus low hemoglobin - red blood cells counts - that forced me to receive 2 units of blood on a STAT basis.  I feel nauseated and more pain in my spine since being on this med.  Have also small 1 cm tumor in liver - don't know if this med is helping me or not.  I get it once every week.  I am ready to quit. ",1
"Works for me, easy to use, satisfied with my experience.",4
I experience no severe side effects during treatment with this medication.  It has been 5 years since the end of my treatments and I have developed cardiomyopathy (a weak heart muscle) causing my ejection fraction to be around 24% (50% is normal).  I will have to have an internal defibrillator device implanted to make sure my heart doesn't stop.,5
Developed heart palpitations.,4
"HATE THIS DRUG. NOT SURE YET OF ITS EFFECTIVNESS, SINCE I'M NOT FINISHED WITH MY TREATMENT. IT CAUSES HAIR LOSS,HEART PROBLEMS WHILE ON THE DRUG OR DOWN THE ROAD. ",2
have developed severe heart failure,5
VERY HARD TO TAKE,5
Did not feel bad at all while on this med,5
"I was given this drug for Hodgkins Lymphoma. I call this drug red devil. It changed the color of my fingernails and toenails. It has been 6 months since I completed chemotherapy and my fingernails and especially my toenails are still a different color. My urine was the same color of the drugs when I  received chemo, but it only lasted a day. I loss my appetite. I still have very little appetite. I still feel nauseated, and I vomit easily (well I always had a weak stomach this just made it worst). Just happy to be alive. Thank God. ",4
After 3rd and last cycle I experienced loss of balance.  Following a neuro investigation 2 years after the administration of the drug I was found to have damage of the balance centre in the brain linked to this drug.  I have seen the results of a small study showing womenn over 60 treated with this drug for breast cancer are more likely to be affected by damage to the balance centre.,3
Just finished my treatment praying it works a hard drug had nausea and had to sleep for days after 10 days things were better Unknown if it worked ,2
"I had no problems with this at all.  They normally follow it the next day with a Neulasta shot, and THAT made me sick until I learned that if you take an antihistamine like Claratin one hour before the shot, you won't get sick.  Ask your doctor about this.  It really works.",5
"2009 six treatment three week apart I was able to work, however the day after I was weaks but was able to work. I lost my appetite,hair loss, no nause memory lapse at time, low wbc,rbc and hgb how by the time the next treatment is due it was back up. [ adraimycin and cytoxan]",4
"I had six courses along w/ cytoxin and emeds in 1998, followed by radiation. I'm cancer free and have not had any other health issues.",5
"I was very ill during my treatments, vomiting, joint pain,low counts for many blood work up's, sore's in my mouth,hard to eatand have heart issues after only 1 year from treatment. My breast cancer came back almost 2 yrs on the date I was originally diagnosed.Now the breast cancer is in my spine and many other bones.",1
"I guess the best thing is that I am in remission. Probably due to this and the combination of drugs. Not sure if heart symptoms I experience are from this or not.  Since chemotherapy 3 years ago I have not been able to exercise aerobically much beyond walking or I feel like I can't get adequate blood flow and breath well enough, like I'm going to faint. My heart beats very rapidly with minimal exertion. Wondering if it's because it was effected by this drug.",5
"I rec'd 3 courses of Adriamycin & Cytoxan in 1996.  Have remained CA free.  However, am now developing numbness and some pain in toes.  Primary Care Phy. believes it is a side effect from the above.  Have not been able to locate any info.information provided to me regarding this as a side effect.",5
"This drug got the job done, but caused me to have Congestive Heart failure, 2 leaking valves on my heart, low lung function,Cardiomyopathy, and Cardiac Arrhythmia.  I had 4 rounds on 2 different occasions.  I am a 3X breast cancer survivor. It also made me very sick. But I am cancer FREE.  THANK GOD!!!!",5
"I was 50 yrs old when treated, 4 years  later the memory loss, concentration & organization have not fully returned. This has made returning to the work place difficult. ",5
I received this drug 15 yrs. ago for breast cancer. I now have congestive heart failure + have to take medication daily. I also have developed another primary site of lung cancer. ,4
I did not have a lot of side effects to this drug it was everything else you take that you get sick from.  I did not have any vomitting at all while on this.,5
I experienced nausea from day 1 until 5 days before my next treatment.  My treatments lasted 5-6 hours each time.  I was totally exhausted.,3
"After my first treatment,  I didnt have any other side effects.  I am worried about the long term issues like congestive heart failure which can occur anytime between now and 30 years from now by taking this medicine!",5
i had no side effects from this drug.,4
Less side effects thAN ANTICIPATED,3
No worse than I expected - I had Adriamycin w/Cytoxan every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. Had great anti-nausea meds (Emend) and made it through working full time. It leaves you feeling pretty bad on day 4-5 for a couple of days but it beats the alternative (metastasis) of having a very aggressive breast cancer. Not easy - but doable!,5
"I had my right kidney removed Jan 2017 and part of my right lung as it had metas. I was on Sutent and very ill and on another drug that did not work. So far Afinitor helping to shrink my tumors in my lungs. The only side effect is a slight cough and some fatigue. Our family almost can not afford the brand one. So I have to change to the cheap generic drugs from bonhoa.com which price is only  1/24 of the brand one. Until now, it works very well. God bless all you. ",5
"Stage 4 breast cancer with lymph and bone metastasis. Never on infusion chemo due to my autonomic diabetic nerve damage. Hormone treatments failed. Tamoxifen gave me terrible forgetfulness. Took Xeloda. At 6 months scan showed cancer gone except in giant ulcer on chest. Then Xeloda failed and cancer spread rapidly. Afinitor worked quickly with visible changes in two weeks. Four weeks ulcer showing definitely better . Been about 5 months. Cat scan showed no cancer active. Ulcer a third smaller and still healing. Cancer itching totally relieved although some iching as larger tumors heal. Had some nose slight bleeding issues early on but with summer humidity no problem. Chronic slight cough and congestion. Short of breath but can walk. bonhoa.com helps me a lot, when I can not afford Afinitor.",5
"I take 10 mgs each evening.  As of Dec. 15, 2017, I will have been on this drug for two years.  As soon as I started it, I developed some very mild diabetes, diarrhea (probiotics stopped it), some nausea, and fatigue. Never had any infections or mouth ulcers! I immediately went into remission post mets diagnoses in Dec. 2015 with the mets cancer located in my left iliac wing neither growing or spreading.  In fact, some spots of cancer in my lower spine have completely disappeared!  I have steadily improved with increasing energy and sense of well-being.  I'm doing amazingly well! Yes, I'd recommend it!  It's been like a miracle drug for me!",4
"Took this for metastatic breast cancer with Exemestane. I felt fine for 2 1/2 weeks and then was hit with severe mouth sores. It was extremely painful and I had trouble eating, talking, and swallowing. I stopped taking it after 3 weeks. I first noticed my gums were tender. The sores came on suddenly and took about 2 weeks to subside after stopping the medication. I did try the mouthwash the doctor prescribed but it wasn't very helpful. My cancer markers did go down slightly.",3
I was part of the original trial for Afinitor over eight years ago and just recently stopped using it - it had become ineffective for my cancer.  It worked well for eight years - well past my initial three month expiration date.  Side effects were tolerable.  The body adjusts and the severity of the side effects seemed to diminish over time.  Please hang in there and stay positive!  Your own attitude will affect how you live and heal.,5
"Taken in combination with exemestane, has kept lesion in neck lymph from growing but has not reduced it. Disturbing loss of smell/taste.",3
The medication stopped holding back the growth of the tumors after about 1 yr and then lymphedema of my leg occurred and significant iron deficiency anemia which I belived was caused by the medication . requiring transfusions and always feeling tired.,2
"Been on this drug for 4 weeks. The start was rocky with flu like symptoms & fever. The MD wanted me to at least try for a full week, by the end of the week I was feeling better. It has all calmed down now and I seem to be tolerating it well. I am a bit more fatigued, had some mouth sores. Looking to the future!!",4
"My dad has kidney cancer and has removed his left kidney.  he has consumed afinitor 10mg about 7 days. So many side effects happen. sore mouth and sore throat , reddish on face, nose bleeding almost everyday, fatigue, feel tired. Can anyone know / experiencing whether those are normal symthoms of side effects? is it temporary side effects or will occurs as long as we consume the afinitor? ",3
Severe mouth sores can be avoided by pushing the pill into a mini marshmallow ......that way it does not touch the mucas (sp)  membranes in the mouth/throat. I chose not to continue this medication......,1
We have been fighting breast cancer since November 1999. In 2001 we were told that it had returned as inoperable metastatic breast cancer of her spine and pelvis. After using many different chemo's my wife was started on Afinitor/Aromasin in late March. At that time her tumor marker was over 3000. By May it was 1200.June 651.July 471.August292. We are amazed and very pleased with the results!!!,5
"My oncologist asked me to try this for 6 weeks.  After one week, I was doing just fine but by day 10, I had a negative reaction to a bar of soap I'd used before.  My face swelled up, I got painful sores in my mouth, was diagnosed with Bronchitis and could barely eat or drink without pain.  I was surprised because I hadn't been warned that products I'd used up to now could be bad for my system.  I did change my toothpaste as suggested in the directions but nothing was said about bath soap or external applications.  I had to stop taking the drug at the end of week 2.  I am still suffering with a swollen face and facial skin that is dry and shedding.  I look awful and when my face is not itching, it is burning.  I have to take a pain pill so I can sleep.",2
"Going well for my wife so far.  Stage IV Breast Cancer.  Tamoxifen was not working, but Afinitor seems to be working ( breast tumor has reduced in size quite alot ).  Side effects are not bad ( mouth sores ).",5
I had my left kidney removed June 2011 and part of my left lung as it had metas. I was on Sutent and very ill and on another drug that did not work. So far this is helping to shrink my tumors in my lungs. The only side effect is a slight cough and some fatigue.,3
"After failing on 5 other chemo treatments, my Dr put me on Afinitor.  Finally, my numbers are dropping again! The only side effects that I have experienced are a few mouth sores and nose bleeds. My hair is growing back, the neuropathy in my legs is going away and I am full of energy again. No more sitting in the chair for 3 hours every week..... just one pill a day, and a once a month visit to the Dr for blood work.  I love this medication because it has given me back my quality of life :-)",5
never,4
"wife has been on it for 9 weeks with impressive results after failing on sutent and nearly dying from an allergic reaction to torisel. So far, so very good. She has gotten her life back and even traveled overseas for about three weeks. Causes fatigue and some sore mouth, but Biotene helps with the latter(mouthwash and tooth paste). As always with this disease and its associated medicines, just wondering how long this will last. Disease progressed significantly in the period between the first two failures and the start of the new therapy. Our physician says that he has had people on this medicine for a long time (up to 2 years); here's to hoping for the same here...",5
My father used this drug for 5 months. Nothing happened and it has very very bad side effects I do not recommend using this drug try sth else. Doctor stopped this drug for my father,1
"working very well,no side effects as of yet,no signs of cancer in lastchest exray",4
I have some mouth sores,4
just started on7-12-10,1
I was taken off this drug: I was told it was not working. (I was on a clinical trial at the time. I took the drug for a period of 9 months.),1
I do get red rashes on my body & face.,4
I have used Aldara cream for a skin cancer on my head.I used it for 4 weeks. I now have a large bald patch . My dermatologist told me that I would not lose my hair. I now feel suicidal and very very depressed. I just canÃ¢Â?Â?t face the world like this. It is a horrible disfigurement.,3
"I was diagnosed with a small BCC on the side of my nose, very close to my eye, and prescribed Aldara cream for 6 weeks (5 days on, 2 days off).  Nothing happened for the first 4 weeks and then the area started going red and scaly.  It is now 6 and a half weeks since I started treatment and the area looks awful - has increased in size and is red and crusty.  The skin irritation has spread right into the corner of my eye which is painful and rather worrying as I have wet macular degeneration in that eye. I know this means the cream is working, but I look as if I have a disgusting and contagious skin problem! Due to the closeness of the BCC to my eye, I did find applying the cream difficult. I used an earbud to apply the cream so am not sure if I used a sufficient amount. The only side effect I've noticed is that I am very tired all the time. Hopefully it will start clearing up now. ",3
"I have used Apsara for a BCC on my shoulder and face and my body reacted badly. Severe fatigue, headache and nausea and dizziness. I used it twice a month apart and had the same reaction! It's now more than 10days and I am still sick!. The BCC appears gone but I feel terrible. I am usually a healthy and fit 61year old who takes no medication!",3
"I am in my 5th week of using Aldara. I live in the West Indies where it is mostly sunny and hence hot. ( Added in case that info may be of use)  A few new things have been happening since using it.... perhaps side effects. Heaviness on chest like food it not being digested properly sleep interference Redness on site ( BCC OM SIDE OF FACE OS BEING TREATED) - crusty at wk 4 into 5 of 6 weeks (use nightly and break on weekends) Muscle pain though I had a bit prior to use Swollen gland under chin Fatigue  The area was small before use.I had a regular sized pimple now it is a conspicuous spot that has persons enquiring about it.  It is hard to tell where to apply since other pimple-like nodules came up in Wk 3 and has merged with original one. This is the most frustrating part since I fear apllying to the wrong area thus defeating the purpose.  Oh, how can I forget.....  the most significant side effect for me is the ITCHING around the area.   I give thanks though, the raised nodules are flat and at wk5, the crusty area feels as if it is healing.... not too tender to touch and dry even after I have washed my face.  If it works, I see Dr. in a month, the side effect would be worth it since none has been extremely significant.  I.must add that I have albinism and also that one sachet lasts for one week. My Dr. hinted I could use and store in a sealed bag in the refrigerator. The dermatologist was sure to add it was not a recommendation. Hope I have been of help to someone. Previous reviews have really helped me to stick to the treatment. I would have been scared if my experiences were not shared by others who used before and made me know wjat to expect. ",3
"Confirmed diagnosis of Basal Cell cancer on the face. Tried this medication on one side of my face, and within two weeks had the worst cold/flu symptoms I have ever had in my life. I knew this was a side effect of the medication, and immediately stopped it. Called the doctor to report it and was told, ""Oh, that's not from the drug.."". I responded to the PA who made that comment to READ THE PI for known side effects. Did not finish as I did not want to suffer for six weeks of this. So I can't speak of results. Opted for Photodynamic therapy which is one day, one treatment. Know that you have other options in treating this problem, and check with your doctor.",1
"After using Aldara on my nose only,for 9 days, I developed a cold sore on my lip. It grew into a huge, painful lesion, cracked, bleeding lips and red, raw patches inside my lip. It was so painful that I was on the verge of tears for a week. 2 weeks later, it's still not better. My doctor and the patient info didn't warn me topical Aldara could become systemic and lead to such a drastic side effect. There should be better patient ed.",2
After using Aldara I have now developed an autoiimmune disease.  In very good health prior.,3
After using Aldara I have now developed an auto immune disease.  In very good health prior.,3
I now have Sjögren syndrome and am convinced it is from the Aldara.,3
"I was prescribed Aldara for genital warts that after being biopsied were determined to be precancerous lesions on. Y scrotum. This creamâ??s side effects were horrible to my penis, as it caused the foreskin to swell and become severely inflamed and sore, much like a burn. Walking, even sitting or sleep became an issue and I finally could no longer withstand the pain and visited my dermatologist again, who advised I stop the treatment and use a steroid based ointment along with Muciprocin (Bactriban I understood). I am currently on day two of this and have some relief and can sleep again. I am on medical leave until this settles down.",1
"I used this for treating a BCC and wart on my shoulder. It worked like magic and I had no side effects. My dermatologist told me to prick the sachet with a pin and squeeze out only what I needed. A sachet lasted for the three days, so I wasn't using much. Perhaps this is why I was so lucky. My experience with having BCCs removed surgically (many) is also excellent, no scarring at all if done by a plastic surgeon, so don't be afraid to go that route. ",5
Used 3x a week as prescribed and woke up one day with bright red skin and oozing blisters. Extremely painful to the point where I can barely walk. Make sure that you use the least bit amount of this stuff and don't let it touch surrounding skin unless you want to be unable to walk and in excruciating pain for a week. ,4
BEWARE using on the face near hairline - Prescribed Aldara cream for facial sun damage near the hairline it didn't work but it did cause alopecia - I have been told it might grow back - the hair loss is the size of a 50p piece - my Dermatologist did not warn me of this side effect and nor did the accompanying leaflet with the drug so beware it has been 10 months now and the hair loss has caused more stress than the sun damage - I will be writing to the company very soon.,1
"My doctor prescribed Aldara for my face. I stopped the medication after 3 weeks (it was prescribed for 4 weeks). Shortly after starting the medication I developed bright red spots covering most of my face that look like chicken pox. The medication activated my cold sore virus so my entire upper lip is covered in cold sores. I'm now on a medication to help heal cold sores and am applying a steroid cream to decrease inflammation. I would not recommend this medication to anyone, especially on the face.",1
"My grandmom used aldara on a BCC,she had terrible side effects,headach,convulsions,and died. Before using aldara she feels good.",1
"Over 12 months ago my doctor prescribed aldara to treat 3 small warts on my foreskin. I applied the cream as per the instructions and did not experience any side effects except for very mild redness in the area I was applying it. After maybe 6-8 weeks 2 of the warts shrunk down and disappeared, I was delighted it was finally working. I continued applying the cream to the last (and biggest) wart and waited for the same thing to happen. Nothing happened at all with the last one. After another 2-3 months of applying the cream I went back to the doctor and explained what was happening. I gave up on aldara and asked for something else so he prescribed warticon.  The pharmacist warned me to be very careful when applying warticon because the side effects can be very severe. I applied it for almost 6 months and experienced no side effects or burning. It made absolutely no difference to the wart. In fact if anything it was getting bigger.   At this stage I was very frustrated and gave up on Warticon. I decided to give Aldara another shot since it had worked on 2 warts for me first time round. I applied Aldara 3 times a week as instructed for 2-3 months and again nothing happened. It was definitely getting bigger and I was ready to go back to my doctor and request to have it frozen off.  The night before I was going to phone the doctor was one of the 3 nights for applying the cream. I decided for a change I would clean the wart first with hot water, I used VERY hot water ie. boiling with a little cold water added to it. Well the wart didnt like it at all and it turned quite tender and red. That was one week ago and it has almost disappeared since then! I think the hot water helped soften the wart so that the Aldara cream could soak in. Before the hot water the wart was very hard and crusty. I am so happy that it is finally working, I was so so frustrated after over 12 months of treatment.  I hope this helps someone else out there, I know how hard it can be. Use HOT water!!!",5
"I put this cream on my ears and a spot on my forehead.  The itching and burning were unbearable, to the point that I could not sleep.  I was up the entire night.  I am itching on my forehead, eyelids, and other places I didn't use it.  The itching is so bad I think I am going out of my mind.  Lidacaine burned, cortizone burned.  Nothing has helped so far.  Will never take this drug again.",3
"Treated warts on shaft of penis.  Once, accidentally got some on scrotum, wiped off - resulted in severe chemical burns on scrotum. Treatment area on shaft never had any reaction, despite direct application.  Warts never responded after 2 weeks of treatment.  Eventually treated with apple cider vinegar and warts went away. Stung, but much less than scrotum burn from imiquimod, and actually worked.  Would not recommend this drug for men w/ warts in areas which could be treated with ACV.",1
"I have been using this medication for years.  Depending on the basil cell spot, the cream reacts differently.  I have had some spots that grew to the size of a dollar coin, very painful, and the cancer spot has been eradicated.  Some spots react with a small red lumpy itchy area the size of a pencil eraser.  The only side effect physically is that I get very tired.  I feel this cream is very effective, however, each person reacts differently.  I hope this review is helpful.   ",5
"I have extensive actinic keratosis on my face, chest and shoulders. I have been treated 3 times over 6 years. Imiquimod has worked the best, but with painful lesions. I tried Carac, which was milder but did not get rid of the lesions. I have been told I will need repeated treatment in the future. I am voting for imiquimod, use it during the winter so I am covered up. Carac was just not effective and I have such extensive disease that freezing or surgery would be a lot worse. I am unwilling to risk more advanced cancer. ",5
I was told I had HPV genital warts about a week ago. I rushed straight to the GUM clinic and they gave me Aldara after having cryotherapy. I've had the tiniest bit of itching but nothing I couldn't ignore. I caught mine pretty quick so I had a mild case of GW. I used a Q-tip to apply whilst using a hand mirror to look. My biggest one has already shrunk after the 3rd application! Considering I have type one diabetes this is amazing. Have a few in awkward places but I have seen improvement. I am putting it on every other day for a month and then if needs be going back for a check up.   Don't let the horror stories scare you from using this cream and make sure you use it correctly!,5
"Been on med. for two weeks,no side affects as of yet. 3x week mwf  three sm. areas with reaction. Red crack and dry. all on my scalp. Hope this works tried of dealing with skin issues. Two more weeks to go.Then see Derm. two weeks after.",3
"I used Aldara for several months on my face and chest. I ended up with hundreds of painful lesions. It hurt a lot. However, considering the percent that could have progressed to SCC, I persisted and my skin cleared up completely and is very nice and smooth. A year later I am on round 2, but have many less lesions. This showed me the drug worked. I am a freckled redhead, raised in sunny CA. This treatment may be painful, but I will take pain over surgery and disease progression any day. I am a pharmacist.",5
"I have used this cream for 1 month on a small spot on my upper lip that the Doctor said was pre-cancerous.  It made my upper lip very sore and nasty looking!  Back to the Doctor in a month for follow up, fingers crossed it has done its job!",4
"Aldara is a money spinning scam, it's dangerous, most painful  and should long have been forbiten.",1
"Have a small basal cell carcinoma side of my nose.near my eye.6 week course ofAldara cream.ok at first .but after 3weeks. A scab very sore and started to weep .went docs and recomend stop the cream for a [email protected] tablets ,to clear infection...feeling rough...not looking forward to going back on the cream.for 3more weeks....",3
"I was prescribed this by my dermatologist. She said I may feel nauseaus. I am applying it to my upper chest 5 times per week and have finished 2 weeks. I'm stopping until I see her. It is itchy, burning, blisters formed and are now one big dry sore that is about 3 cm wide.I have had flu like symptoms, my lips swelled up to twice their size and were very sore. I had to take acycyclovir for 4 days to combat that side effect. I wish that the doctor and the pharmacist would have better prepared me. I'm not happy with the treatment side effects and the lack of information from the drug manufacturer. ",1
"Hi I have been using this cream for the last four weeks with two more to go thank goodness I would never have believed that a cream could make you feel so yuk ranging from aches,pains,tiredness,itching,blistering,it does seem to be doing what it says it does by destroying the cells I feel a bit of a fraud really as to any one else it's only a cream but it really does make you feel awful (is it just me) oh well two weeks left fingers crossed",3
"I began use of Aldara approximately 2 months ago for two large bcc, one one each shoulder. Since the patches are so large I have to use 2 doses to cover the areas.  During the first week of use, the pain was excruciating, a 9 out of 10.  I have since learned that this reaction occurs in 3% of cases. Fortunately, the pain ended after the first week.  The areas have also become extremely inflamed with a rash and hives. the peripheral areas are so inflamed that I have difficulty remembering the situs of the bcc (the severely inflamed area of one shoulder is about 12.5 cm by 12.5 cm) and therefore make a best guess on where to apply. The other site is less of a problem. I am also experiencing joint pain in my knees and hip. I am 57 so that may be a coincidence but it is listed as a side effect. I also have an inguinal protrusion and occasional mildly sharp pains which may be the result of the hernia surgery I had a month ago, but again is also listed as a side effect. I will have an answer to this after next weeks follow up surgeon's appointment.  I will continue to fight my way through the side effects and continue with the drug as long as my doctor can assure me that the side effects are temporary, since the alternative is surgery and substantial scarring.  I keep reminding myself that chemo is not supposed to be fun. I will update this post when I have more information. ",4
"I was given Aldara to use by my GP after being diagnosed with HPV. I had 5 genital warts initially, one large (about the size of a pea) and 4 small. Was told to use 3x weekly, every other day for 1 month. I must say I was horrified to try Aldara after reading horror stories online, but desperate times called for desperate measures. I am at the end of Week 2 and am pleased to say that all 5 warts are almost entirely gone. The largest is the only one that remains and it is barely noticeable.   I did experience some minor irritation, redness and swelling of the labia where the cream may have accidentally spread, but nothing severe/unbearable. I applied the cream VERY sparingly which I think is key to avoiding the awful side effects others have reported.   I am going to continue applying Aldara where the warts once appeared until my follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Hopefully this will prevent the warts from resurfacing!   Overall I am very happy with the results and would recommend to anyone suffering from GW.",5
"BCC on my chest large enough that if surgically removed would have required general anethesia. So they talked me into using this stuff. Have had flu like symptoms from the beginning, feel like crap. Also have developed prostate pain and frequent urination, plus ED. I'm at week 4 and the Dr. suggested backing off to MWF at week 3. Would like to finish the last 2 weeks but these side effects are freaking me out.",4
"I was quite surprised by all the bad reviews, symptoms must vary depending on why the individual is using the cream, I personally am using due to a collection of GW's on my anus, embarrassing as it is, I highly recommend anyone to use for this reason, I started my course Friday evening, and apply last thing at night 3 times a week, 4 applications later and they are significantly reduced!, a months course should get rid completely.  I did not have to personally meet a doctor to get this prescription only drug, Lloyds pharmacy online doctors dealt with my query professionally and quickly, all I had to do was send a photo, and within two days my cream arrived by courier.  Hope this helps, and all the best! ",3
"This treatment was a doozy for sure. I'm twelve weeks in already and most of the sun damage has been repaired. I know the first few weeks were really rough--red spots, scabbing, itching, etc. But, those symptoms just mean that the medicine is working. I had what I thought were three AK's and the medicine brought up dozens and dozens. I shudder to think of these ticking time bombs on my skin (I'm only 55--but, pasty-white skin and blue eyes and lived in Hawaii 20 years). The good news, if you stick it out, is that as you round into the last few weeks of treatment, you really see less and less redness (almost completely gone) and you end up with baby skin. Truth be told, as bad as the treatment can seem, the payoff with the silky skin at the end makes me wonder why the cosmetic folks don't hail this as a panacea for younger, soft skin. In any event, I'll know the effectiveness for sure over years and not just months. But, I can tell you this--if it helped my body get rid of abnormal cells that showed up as red and scabby, then I'm glad they're gone. I had much more sun damage than even I thought and thank heavens for Aldara. Yes, it's a long treatment. Yes, you look like crap. Yes, it's itchy and can make you fatigued. But, none of that is as bad as cancer. I would definitely recommend and do again, given the degree of hidden damage.  ",5
"I have been applying Aldara for 8 weeks now/ a 16 week regiment.  My BCC is approx 3 inches round on my upper arm.  Medication burns, itches but does appear to be doing what it is supposed to do.  However side effects horrible.  First 4 weeks severe body pain followed by severe shortness of breath now for over a month, ended up in emerg.  I can't take the side effects and am going to doc this week.  Hope there are alternatives.  ",3
"I used Aldara for 4 weeks, the first 3 weeks five days on, two days off, the fourth week one day on one day off (per instructions from my dermo.)as the inflammation and itching and blistering and pain were awful and I felt like I had flu the whole time.  The dermo. said that because I had such bad inflammation, the treatment might have worked even tho' I stopped 2 weeks early.  I still have a bad painful rash above and all around my lips, even tho' I haven't used the cream for a week and a half - does this ever clear up, I feel so miserable.  The BCC is on the cupid's bow of my lip, and the dermo. said that surgery would be painful and leave a scar.  I just hope to feel better soon, it's been a horrible experience, especially for someone who has been sun-smart their whole life.",2
"Have just finished using for three weeks on my chest, had one sunspot and after two days my chest was covered in them. Can't describe how painful the treatment was, finished six days ago and chest is still scabby, weeping and very sore. Dr says it is as it should be and It should be clear in few weeks.. Don't know if I would recommend it.. Also had back ache and aching body while using it.. Just hope all cancer cells have been killed..",3
"I can't really rate the effectiveness correctly yet as I have only been applying the cream for 5 nights -- but so far this has been far more difficult than I had ever imagined. I expected the raw face, but starting at day 3 I felt as tho every last part of my body had been put thru the ringer and every ounce of energy sucked out of me .. on top of that, on day 4 I developed cold sores and fat lips (that the derm called in valacyclovir for)  ... I finally was able to get out of bed today but not for long .. I am looking forward to these 2 days off of the cream and hoping that once I start back up that my body will have adjusted and not react so violently to it. ",3
"The site of the bcc (shoulderh turns into a crusty sore, but I had no side effects..maybe a headache for a day or so..but could have been coincidence.  Other then that..I'm in week 3...all good sofar",4
"I used Aldara for 4 wks and the side effects are horrible. I have had to take a one week break but started back yesterday. I use it 3 times a wk and the Dr. said it should take about 3 months. The blistering and itching are the minor side effects for me. I am also experiencing headache, backache, sinus problems, severe body aches, chills, sleepiness. For an active person, I can not stress HOW BAD I feel and do not have energy to do anything. And the longer you use it the worse the side effects are. But, it is helping to clear up my cancer and my only other option is surgery. Surgery for me would require a skin graft that possibly may not take due to the location. I am looking at having to take a medical leave from work to finish my treatments.   ",4
"I just started using this cream one week ago. I had 4 small patches of raised bumps, went to my doctor and was upset to find out yes it is hpv. I was shocked because I have always been super cautious and have had a very limited number of sexual partners. My doctor informed me that unless you have only had one partner (and your partner only has had one partner, you) you have more than likely been exposed to hpv. My gyno prescribed  this cream because it works with your immune system to hopefully prevent more break outs. Within the first two treatments, 2 out of the 4 patches were gone. I was directed by my doctor to use the cream 3x weekly. What I saw after using the cream on the patches was that they would look very dry and whitish and this skin would come off and it leaves a red patch of skin. I called my doctor because I was so surprised that the areas were gone so quickly and asked her if I needed to keep putting it on that tender skin and she said to keep using it but 2x a week for 4 weeks. As far as discomfort goes, mine has been minimal. I noticed that the day after I apply the cream the skin is more tender but I have had no real pain, and honestly I'm not sure I would care if there was. Anything to make it go away is fine with me. I apply the cream at night before I go to bed (shower before), with a q-tip, only on the areas. I wake up and shower to rinse it off. I have put some antibiotic ointment w/pain reliever and hydrocortisone cream on the areas sometimes if I felt discomfit and that does the trick. After 3 treatments all of the patches are gone and overall I am feeling much better about the situation. I will continue to use the cream for 3 more weeks and check back with my doctor, in hopes to prevent future breakouts. I would say don't beat yourself up, it is extremely common and my doctor also told me that you can have one break out and never see another again but that is not for certain. The cream is expensive, my insurance payed $293, I payed $10. ",5
"I have only been using this medication for 3 weeks, but since week 1, I have been suffering from flu-like symptoms, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, chronic fatigue, sinus problems, body aches, weakness, hot flashes, cold sweats and nausea. I informed my dermatologist I suffered from fybromialgia (?) and really didn't want to use anything that would increase the pain I already feel and she assured me it wouldn't be a problem. She was wrong. After reading the reviews of other users of this cream, I am definitely going to give her a call.   ",3
"Have been using this medication for the past 2wks now, it's not very useful. It wipes/washes off each time you use the bathroom, therefore making it very ineffective. Have experienced tiredness on this med and not feeling like myself. Have experienced ulcers on treatment areas, and it seems like the area actually got worse than better. Like I said , it's been only 2wks, so going to give it some more time to see how effective this is. They really should've made this med a thicker cream rather than being so light.",2
It's difficult looking like I do and did (this is my second round with Aldara cream)the last time I used it on my forehead but the results were very good and without the headaches and other side effects that are mentioned in the brochure. I had the usual red blotches with some eruptions like a teenager with bad acne but all in all I am very pleased with the results and would recommend the treatment to all that can tolerate the side effects. Would not apply Aldera for more than FOUR (4) weeks and only apply on M-W-F then skip the weekend and start again on Monday.,4
"I was prescribed Aldara when diagnosed with HPV. The wart was on the side of my mouth and about the size of a pencil eraser. After 12 weeks of treatment and $600.00 for the medication it hadn't gotten any smaller. The medication itself caused the otherwise normal skin around the wart to break open and bleed. The other side effects were as terrible: nausea, diarrhea, general flu-like symptoms the morning after an application. After the 12th week of treatments I had enough of the emotional and physical pain, so I purchased an over-the-counter kit that freezes the wart off and used it according to the instructions. Inside of 36 hours, the wart turned black and fell off in the shower revealing new, pink skin underneath. I believe that Aldara was misprescribed for this condition, and my general experience with it made an already painful condition so much worse. I wish I would've tried the freezing kit before wasting my time, energy and money on this medication. ",1
"I have a BCC on my lip at the cupid's bow. I didn't get very clear instructions on where to apply the aldara but since the biopsy was on the lip, I applied it there and above the lip (even though the directions say not to apply it on the lip...but that's what the doctor told me to do...). It's been a nightmare- swollen, crusty, bloody, painful lips. I would post photos if I could...The plastic surgeon said to hang in there and that it was working. Plus I feel sick and tired all the time too. The worst part is living by myself with no one to look after me and having to go out in public. It's soul sucking and embarrassing and I'm so ashamed. I am mortified. ",2
my dermatologist was burning the gw off of me with liquid nitrogen and suggested the aldara would work better.  he was not very thorough and we never seemed to get all of the warts.  we tried a small sample size of aldara and the warts were reduced.  i got a prescription and after a few applications burning started and i stopped using it.  eventually bright pink permanent scars appeared.  i went to a urologist who quickly and painlessly removed the gws with electric cauterization.  so i went through YEARS of unnecessary pain and scarring for nothing because my doctor wanted me to keep coming back for treatment.,1
"I had a small case of external genital warts. After being prescribed Aldara by my GYN, I read multiple review sites on the medication.  Thank goodness I did as I was able to avoid the horrible side effects of the medication and my warts were gone within 2.5 weeks.  APPLY AS DIRECTED.  Small amount, use a Q tip and hand mirror for precision. APPLY ONLY TO THE WART.  It may be helpful to apply petroleum jelly to the healthy areas around the wart so that the don't get irritated if the cream touches them.  Leave on for 6-10 hours, 3 times a week (nightly is suggested.)  Wash off the gentle soap and water.  I only had mild itching which was very tolerable. If you read the successful reviews - Aldara was applied sparingly, carefully and as instructed.  If you deviate from this, you may run the risk of the sores/blisters/etc.  Be patient.  Don't overdo it.  I really believe this can work for simple cases and if done properly, will not lead to horrible side effects.  I hope this review helps - I too was scared, stressed and going out of my mind when I was told I had GW, but reading the success stories helped put my mind at ease.",5
"Im a 24 year old female and started using Aldara around August of this year.I didn't seem to notice any change in the beginning, but as week four of treatment ended I noticed the warts were starting to go away.I didn't have many to begin with,so it was easy to keep track of how well the medication was working.My prescription was for 12 weeks, which I loosely followed the directions.It's probably not the smartest idea to skip treatments, or apply the cream without really paying attention to just areas with warts, but it works!I suffer from minor burns and itching.It really wasn't anything I couldn't handle.In my experience it isn't as much painful as it is uncomfortable.Since I skipped weeks at a time, I'm still using the cream for a few warts that are left.My advice, apply it the three times a week.I'm sure if I followed directions, I wouldn't have the few warts I have left.I couldn't be more thankful for how well the cream works, and it is definitely worth the slight discomfort.Like most users said, the prescription is expensive for such a small amount of cream, but only runs those with insurance a $10-$30 co-pay.Everyone's body reacts different to the virus as well as the medication, but it is worth trying it out.Don't get discouraged if you don't see instant results!Best of luck!",4
"I applied Aldara on my chest for two weeks, four days on, three days off. By the second week, I felt very flu-like, swollen lymph glands, headache, nausea, taste buds were absent, muscles were achy. night chills with fever and serious heart palpitations. Lost 4 pounds. Also got a genital herpes outbreak, which I have not had for 20 years. This cream disturbs your immune system. I decided the risk was too much for me, and I stopped. There are other creams like Carac and Effudex, which may not be so systemically invasive. My opinion is that this is a very expensive drug, $300 for 24 doses, unless you have insurance, and I do believe dermatologists prescribe this because they  get the 'kick-back' from the drug companies. There are less costly options. It was not worth the misery or compromising my health. One week after stopping this, finally, my heart palpitations have stopped, my swollen neck glands seem normal, and I no longer have the fever/chills. This drug is not for the faint of heart. 3M ought to be ashamed of themselves. Way too many studies and comments about the safety of this drug.  Go find a conscientious dermatologist who can help you without applying chemotherapy into your body.  ",1
"Prescribed after surgery for BSC on left side of nose.  Derm, says they didn't quite get it all.  After reading all these reviews I'm scared to even try it.  Will talk to derm. and see if there's another way!",1
"I was prescribed this med. for basal cell carcinoma on my face. The carcinoma was so tiny in size, it was barely noticeable. However, by the time my 8 week treatment was over, it was almost the size of a silver dollar. The first three weeks, I applied it 3 times a week. Then the dermatologist examined me and changed the treatment to 2 times a week until the end of the 8 weeks. It was fire engine red and scabby--truly scary and ugly. However, it did not burn or itch. I had no other side effects. I am happy to report it has been 4 weeks since I finished the treatment, the carcinoma is gone and my skin looks almost normal--just a light pink. When the dermatolist examined me yesterday, she said the light pink would eventually fade to my normal skin tone. However, she suggested if I'd like to hurry that process, she could laser it (said the laser disburses the pink) and there would be no evidence my face had been treated.I encourage anyone who worries (as I did) during the treatment that they will be scared forever, don't give up and don't worry about your eventual appearance. FYI, I am a very vain woman so if I'm happy with the outcome, I think you will be too.",4
"After reading some of these reviews I was very concerned about using Aldara. I decided to go ahead and had no side effects at all. The site on my back became a little sore after about 3 weeks and scabbed.The scab came off and left a pink area.After 6 weeks of the treatment it is now a faint pink mark and I am to see the dermatologist in 4 weeks to see if it has gone.Everyone is different and not everyone suffers bad side effects. I do think that people who have a bad experience report more than those of us who have not, hence my report.     ",5
" I had Basal cell cancer on my neck and was given the cream to apply. The 3rd day of using it I found tightness in my chest and called the hospital. They did tests such as blood test, EKG and Xray, although they came back negative they admitted me over night. The next day I did a stress test, more blood work and echocardiogram, which all came back negative. They released me and 2 days later I started using the cream again. Guess what came back, yup the tightness in my chest. Stopped using the Aldara cream and tightness never came back. Had the basal cell removed by Mohn’s.    ",1
"Had gw's for over 20 years. Until recently, i preferred to use polifox because it always worked short term but the warts always returned. Tried Aldara a year ago. It worked to completely remove all the warts but some returned in a different place about a year later. Using a refill now and am seeing a very serious reduction after about 4 weeks and no side effects.  Aldara is expensive but appears to keep the gw's away the longest.",4
"I am miserable with extreme itching, discomfort, oozing, bleeding, redness.  Have used for 4 wks. with no improvement.",1
lots of side effects-headaches dizzy-achy to the point of needing bedrest,4
"I began using Aldara right after it came on the market. I was originally told by my Dermatologist to use it 2x a week. Recently it was changed to 3x a week, and it would take approx 10 weeks for the spots to go away. It continues to work great for me! The only problem I have is very dry skin, which is one of the common side effects. I believe those who are discouraged need to allow more time for the cream to work.",5
I have rough patches on my face and shoulders due to sun exposure.  I tried the Aldara once before for 4 weeks.  Had the characteristic ugly red spots that ooze and bleed.  The lesions healed well and I figured that I was cured but after 6 months the rough patches started to appear again.  Long story short if even one cell is missed that the medicine is targeting you can get a reoccurance of the patches.  So make sure that you use the Aldara for the recommended 6 weeks.,5
I have one large spot of BCC on my leg. My doctor said to use it twice a week for 6 week. I'm at the beginning of week 4 with no results in sight. The only side affect I have is the itching. I'll give it more time but maybe I should be using it more times per week??,1
"I was diagnosed with BCC on the left side of my nose in the fall of 2007 and underwent surgery. It recurred in 2009 again having surgery with cryosurgery (freezing). By May 2010 it recurred. I was tired of having surgery and I wanted the cancer gone, so I decided to try Aldara. I read the inset that came with it understanding that it is a topical chemotherapy that works with your immune system. I followed the directions exactly,using it for 6 weeks, 5 days of use with 2 days off, using the minimal amount to cover the area, leaving it on for no more than 8 hours and washing it off, staying out of the sun, and not covering it tightly when going out. But by week 3, I had a severe reaction with redness, swelling, oozing, bleeding, scabbing, crusting, itching, fatigue, headaches. It was bad and I almost quit. But the insert mentioned all these side effects, so I decided to cotinue. I am so glad I did. It is now 4 weeks after finishing the six week course and my skin looks so good and my dermatologist gave me an all clear/cancer gone. I wish I had used it when first diagnosed and I wouldn't have the scar from the previous two surgeries. I will use it again if I have any BCC in the future. But, I do believe it is a treatment only for the healthy as it does work with your immune system. From the many reviews I've read, it doesn't seem that a lot of the doctors are prescribing it correctly and with the info patients need and that is way it is so important patient take prescriptions seriously and follow the medication directions exactly and question the doctor if his instructions vary from the medicine.",4
Easy to apply and effective on the facial area.  Not so much on hands or upper body as it doesn't dry quickly and tends to get rubbed off or disturbed.  The liitle sealed pack lasted for three to four treatments when applied by a q-tip (take off a bunch of the fuzz) and doing so sparingly.  Other issue is your face will look a bit red and marked up for two to three weeks especially if you are treating more than a couple of spots.,5
"I was told to apply Aldara to six areas of my face and forehead - 3x a week for 4 weeks.  Within ten days I had 24 angry areas and by the time I'd finished there were 37!  In between I had all the classic flu-like symptoms - muscle, head and back ache, fever, no energy or appetite, insomnia and swollen glands.  But - within a week of stopping the treatment, and applying an antibiotic cream (Fucidin), my face was pretty well back to normal. Now, six weeks after starting, I am completely back to normal with no scarring and a face like a baby's bottom!  It's definitely not easy - and you have to have confidence in it - but at the end of the day it's results that count and in my case it was well worth all the hassle.  The biggest problem is lack of sleep and if you have to treat both cheeks, as I did, the warmth of the pillow makes the inflammation worse and you wind up sleeping in ten minute bites.  Air conditioning helps! ",5
"Was prescribed after removal of a squamus cell on my cheek. Found two other areas during six weeks. Was frustrated because I looked like a leper, but at the end of the six weeks the sores healed and I look fine. Better than surgery, but not as easy as freezing. 1 week into another treatment-not many side affects.",4
"I'm into week 3 of a 4 week course, applying Aldara 3 times a week. Week 1 was a doddle but it soon became apparent that my doctor's instruction - to apply it to six areas of my face, and forehead - was optimistic.  By the end of week 2 I had 16 bright patches rather than 6 and they are now starting to go brown.  I have absolute confidence in my doctor, and will see it through, but it's not easy.  The flu like symptoms, sore throat, swollen glands, toothache and, above all, sleeplessness, are all to evident.  I didn't know this was a chemo-type drug before I started on it - or I would probably have opted to avoid it. In retrospect, if the treatment saves me 16 Mohs ops. I'll be a very happy camper but, like old age, it's not for sissies!  ",5
"My dermatologist prescribed Aldara as a supplement to surgical treatment (biopsy, then additional shaving and cautery) for superficial squamous cell carcinoma on my hand. She told me to use it nightly, beginning 5 days after my surgery ( the surgical site was not yet healed). By night 6 of nightly usage, I had to discontinue the Aldara because of severe, burning pain that kept me awake. I still have the burning at day 8.   I am concerned that this may have caused nerve damage, although it is early to draw any conclusions. I would not recommend this product, and I certainly would not prescribe it ( I am a physician).",1
"until now i have warts,., before i had 12 warts,., when i used aldara i have 3 warts now,.,  i used aldara for about 6 monts,.,  i'm not good in english,., i'm sorry,.,",4
"I'm only on my 5th or 6th treatment and think I'm seeing minor improvement. Difficult to apply with a finger to the specific warts. Others say they use a q-tip so I may try this. It is frustrating to have to shower/apply before bed and shower after bed, but it takes 2 seconds to apply which is nice. It is also nice that you only have to use it 3x/week. I've had warts on my fingers and toes before and know HPV to be stubborn. I like the idea that this product teaches the body to fight HPV, rather than just treating the wart itself. Sure, we want them to just go away, but I had a wart on my thumb frozen off twice, burnt off once, and grow back before I just gave up. Over time it went away on its own. To me, that shows you how it is more about the body responding to the virus than any kind of ""quick-fix."" I have 10-15 extremely small external genital warts on my penis that popped up recently after having 2 larger ones for 5-6 months. I was trying to let my body do its thing for the 5-6 months with the 2 larger ones, but when the smaller ones developed I bit the bullet and saw the doctor. FYI, I don't think doctors are too knowledgable about the ins and outs of HPV and genital warts for males - they just know how to identify them and make a prescription. Here are a few things I've found elsewhere online: there is no test for HPV in men or women that can say with any certainty ""you do NOT have the virus."" Females are tested for a few strands that are most dangerous for them, but not for all stands. Most people get HPV in their life and most of those people never show symptoms. The point is, don't let it ruin a relationship because it is extremely difficult if not impossible to trace the origin of the STD, particularly if you've both had other partners in the last 1-2 years. If you've read this far, I'm not pulling this out of my behind - I've done a lot of reading. Hope this is helpful and that the Aldara clears up my gw's.",2
I am concerned about blisters appearing on the treated areas,4
"Just on 4th day of 4-6 weeks treatment(5x/week). Isomnia and fatigue most notable so far. Area being treated is not a pretty picture,e.g. redness and oozing.",3
"I just finished week 2 of a 5 day on, 2 off.  The spot started the size of a screw head and now with this treatment is the size of a Nickel.  It is an open, oozing sore under my nose and cracks and bleeds everytime I eat.  After reading the notes here, I realize this is the normal course of treatment.  I'm suppose to see the doctor at the end of the week.  What I'm worried about, is the material on this site says, it's not for faces!   I hope it works!",3
"I was prescribed aldara by my dermatologist for sun damage on my lower lip. Although it was actually very effective by the end of treatment, the 10 weeks of treatment were extremely painful. My lip ballooned and became one huge scab. It would bleed with the slightest of touches. However, when treatment stopped, I began using Aquaphor, available at most drug stores over the counter and the lesion cleared up in a couple of weeks. ",5
"I used this for basal cell carcinoma and it did work. However, users should understand that this is a topical form of chemotherapy and that it does give you very minor (in comparison to systemic chemo) chemo like symptoms. Not fun, but effective.",5
"on week 3 of 6wk program.2nd wk has been the worst,was told to use on total forehead for one spot of bbc & use it till I could'nt stand it any longer.That did'nt take long! Redness,swelling,soreness,etc,all over applied areas 1st week. 2nd week with 2day off in between now have multi redspots allover applided area. BCC area is now fully inflammed & open-ozing sore. Have mild fever,aches&pains,sleepless nights. Was told I had residual c-cells on forehead but didnt know how much until I used this cream.I have had 5BCC taken off by surgery & over 30 by other means, This is by far better for me aslong as the other side-affects dont come into play,time will tell.I am on a 5x a week program.",3
"After using this medication for a very small looking freckle, this has been a nightmare for me...I now have a heavy growth steph infection PLUS my whole chest are had broke out with all kinds of infection going on....Would not recommend.. ",1
"Now into my 8th week of using aldara. The first 6 weeks consisted of flu like symtoms, severe bachache and sleeplessness.The initial 4 areas I treated for the first 6 weeks are now almost completely cleared. The next 3 areas are starting to get sore and inflamed as expected. However, my body seems to be getting used to the aldara and except for the bachache, the previous symptoms seem to have pretty much disappeared. One new one though, difficulty breathing which so far is the most difficult to cope with. Mostly when I'm sitting or lying down. Feels like I can't get a full breath of air and something is pushing on my chest. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?",4
"I just completed the six week treatment program.  I was one of the lucky ones and experienced most of the side effects.  The fatigue and flu like symptoms were the worse until my began to have severe back pain.  The lesion size originally was about 9cm, now it is five to six times larger, very sore, red, bumpy, and easily bleeds.  I am afraid that the cancer is more than superficial.  ",2
"Was prescribed for me to use, on my chest, once/day 3X/week for 4 weeks.  After 10 days, I felt systemic reactions.  Severe headaches, extreme fatigue (sleeping 14 - 16 hours daily) and my lungs (internally) felt like I had swallowed broken glass.  I stopped treatment, with my doctor's advice, after 14 days.",2
"I've been on this now for six weeks.  Major fatigue, rough night time sleeping pattern, very mild flu like symptoms.  I have massive extensive lesions throughout my legs and arms. This is the only solution and I am seeing incredible results.  Please, be careful of the sun!",5
"Only been using aldara for 5 days, got another 11 weeks to go. So far all the severe side effects I expected I have not experienced. However, no one warned me of the severe backache and headaches and sleepless nights. I'm finding all the other symtoms bearable but these difficult to cope with. Counting down the next 11 weeks and hopefully it will work.",3
Aldara caused temporary Eczema of my face. Biopsy of face showed Eczema. A few months later I developed Eczema of both arms. Biopsy confirmed Eczema. Both arms and face cleared up after many months. Eczema does not run in my family. Aldara should list Eczema as a side effect. Doctor said I may have recurrences of Eczema throughout my life. I will stick to liquid nitrogen treatments in the future. I also reported my experience to the FDA with their data sheet. The doctor was innocent because he was lied to as well as I.,5
"The area became very ulcerated and oozing.  I was feeling awful and after reading reviews from other users, I am a little relieved to see similar reactions.  I felt flu-like, lethargic and my heart was beating differently.  I don't think I would use this again.",2
"After using Carac for 4 weeks and two painful treatments of Photodynamic light therapy, my dermo decided to try Aldara on me.  I am hoping to avoid a biopsy for BCCC. I am applying it to a small area above upper lip once a night for 14 nights.  I have had only a small amount of peeling, no redness or pain.  Two areas on my chest became hard and red, however.  She said it might attack other areas of actinic keratoses.  My chest was treated with carac 2 years ago and had a very strong,painful reaction.  I am not sure if Aldara is working.  I may not have the toll receptors needed to activate my immune system.  Just trying to avoid an ugly scar on my face as my entire body is scarred from biopsies. The spot on my upper lip is still there on day 5 out of 14.",2
"I was lucky in that my reaction to Aldara was mild.  My derm had me apply it prophalactically to my face, chest, neck and ears after a large BCC was discovered on my nose and was removed by Moh's.  The only side effect I had was a small amount of swollen glands when I applied it to my face.  My overall reaction was basically small red, raised areas that looked like pimples and some ulceration and subsequent crusting to some of those areas.  They disappeared within a week of discontinuance of the med. The swollen glands resolved completely after taking a 2 day respite from the drug.  I discovered a raised reddened area on my face and, when it did not go away after 2 weeks of waiting, I applied Aldara.  It immediately got red and angry, ulcerated, got inflammed and eventually crusted over and healed.  I think that I treated the area much more quickly because I had Aldara handy.  Overall, I think it is a valueable treatment option.  Not everyone has a severe reaction.  ",4
"I had a horrible experience with the cream.  My Nurse practitioner prescribed it to me twice/day, even though I found out the mfr guidelines caution no more than 3 times/week for actinic keratosis.  I had three sites on my forearms - 3 actinic keratosis and 1 squamous cell.  3 of the sites had minimal reaction, including the squamous cell.  The third AK site reacted horribly.  From one dime-sized spot my forearm blistered painfully into a 5"" patch of painful blisters that oozed, bled and looked incredibly ugly. It hurt and the Biafine cream didn't help. The reaction didn't look anything like the 'normal' pictures they gave me.  Worse, the NP had no sympathy, only that any reaction was 'normal', use the biafine cream and it would be fine.  After a horrible scene at the office trying to get them to listen to me, I saw another doctor three days later who referred me to a dermatologist within an hour because the reaction was so severe. I was also very depressed. Needless to say I am never returning the the nurse practitioner or that office.  After 8 days on steroids/prednisone and a topical antiobiotic - it no longer hurts, oozes or blisters. But I still have red/purple splotches that look awful and will keep me in long sleeves for weeks.   I was given no alternatives to the cream, was not warned how badly it could get and I consider the dosage extreme.  I used it 10 times within 5 days before I stopped.  Once stopped the arm grew worse each day.  I'm not sure of the next step, but I have no desire to induce pain again or ever use that cream again.  It's horrible stuff.  My arm no longer hurts but looks pretty ugly.  Thank god it's not my face or I wouldn't leave the house. This cream impacts your life! I wish I had researched it first.  Stay away from it.",1
"This is terrible cream. I experienced every side effect that is listed. I used it two weeks and had burning, itching, redness, blisters in my genital area. And I also experienced the worst flu like body aches of my life.",1
Aldara did not remove the skin cancer on my leg. I used it 5 days a week for 16 weeks. I will return to my doctor when all the swelling goes down so he can try something else.,1
"I went to a Derm. MD for several rough patches on my chest (sun stuff from years ago);the lab said they were not basal..ok,         I followed the Md's order  and took the Aldara as directed..After 14 days I couldn't sleep- intense pain, purple and slight bleeding on my chest and sharp pains in my neck- ...imflamed and  infected and imflamed lymph nodes on  and around where I put the Aldara- neck and throat area- waiting  to hear results- my chest is not much better but the drug may have triggered a much more serious condition..I hated this med..     I have 2 grad degrees (one completed yesterday) and I can only tell you this stuff (Aldara) is toxic...glad it may work for others..for me it was horrible...I stopped the the meds..",2
I have not yet started on Aldara-waiting to hear on scraping of two possible BCC spots-one on my thigh the other on my upper back. After reading these reviews I'm scared to use this if lab comes back positive.   Are there people who've had positive experiences?  Pretty much everything listed here sounds awful and my dermatologist did not mention any of these side effects.,1
"Using to treat squamous cell and basil cell on chest area..  came out in 45+ spots that are apparently areas that have sun damage.  I have felt flu like symptoms, sore neck, muscles and just achy all over.  Sore throat, blocked ears and headache, general feeling of illness and slight depression.  Very itchy and burning.  Went back to dermatologist after 11th application (3 days/wk) and she said I could take a week off if I want to, but that it looked ""normal"" and is doing its job.  She gave me an rx for biafine to soothe the site.  I also apply an topical antibiotic twice a day.    I have 4 -6 weeks left.  Flu symptoms are really the worst part.",4
"After 30 yrs of having BCC's surgically removed, my current dr offered to let me try Aldara.  It's the greatest thing since sliced bread! I began a 5x/week app on my left cheek.  I used very small amt from packet each day.  The site got red, itchy rough, scabby, & oozey so that at the end of the 2nd 5-day period the dr said to stop, wait and watch. By the end of the 3rd week the scabs were drying up and by the end of the 4th week they fell off.  The cream discovered more BCC area than I had thought was there.  The oozey, scabby skin was UGLY and I covered it at times.  The result was fantastic.  I am now in my fifth series of treatments of facial areas.  There is no way that the dr. would know how much skin to surgically remove from the little spot I started with.  If he had used Moh's technique I would have had an ugly face for a longer period and probably have scarring to boot.  Aldara works for me! ",5
"I had/have a pretty severe case of gw.  Probably nearing about 30 gws.  I was so horrified and disgusted every time i looked at it.  I read some of the reviews on here before I tried aldara and was terrified.   I've done three treatments of aldara and have had MAJOR improvement.  Several of them have vanished and the others have reduced in size.  I have had very little discomfort from it.  Yes, I can certainly feel it when it's on and am a little sensitive the next day but nothing unbearable.  Totally recommend it!  ",4
"after 3 weeks I had severe scabbing on forehead diagnosed as cellulitis, in addition to flu=like symptoms.",4
"After 2 week of 5 out of 7 days, not much reaction. Now on 7 days for 2 weeks and spots red and lumpy. Guess it is working. No side effects.",4
"Experienced FLU like symptoms 16 hours after EVERY dose lasting 24 hours, then recovered, then used the cream, viscious cycle.  The nausea, diarrhea, fatigue/malaise SIDE EFFECTS were SEVERE and did not outweigh the benefit.  Am going to seek laser therapy, 2 weeks of discomfort vs 16 on Aldara.  BURNING and ITCHING kept me awake on EVERY night I applied the cream.  End of treatment with 1 dose to go, warts are still there.  SIDE EFFECTS do NOT outweigh the benefits.  ",1
"Dr. prescribed applying it all over my rough chest (Actinic Keratosis), which I had not even noticed until the dermatology exam.  She issued no warnings and told me to use it twice a week for 12 weeks.  Sounded simple, (expensive--over $600)but I just started my 5th week, and I am tempted to stop treatment.  My entire chest is a red, raw, oozing, itching, and burning mess.  I'll probably stick it out, but would not do this again.",3
"I had a very small bcc removed on my chest, the sores on my chest now cover a huge area, derm. says it is doing its job. Feel fatigued, depressed, little bit of sore throat, I trust my derm but this is waay more than I expected. Can't wait to get finished with 3 more weeks of this 6 week treatment. May heart also races some.",3
"Don't touch this stuff with a barge pole! Put minute amounts 2-3 mm on lip line like my doctor told me to as per instructions. Stopped after a couple of weeks when things started going wrong. Three months later my lips are still swollen, raw, sore and infected. Been on steroids, antibiotics, creams. ",1
Hello back to report on the ongoing reaction of Stevens-Johnson Syndroe I got from this drug/cream.  Still got the reaction now 1 year and 4 months since stopping.  I found some Dermeze Oitment for dermatitis and for every desert spoonfull of it I had 10 drops of Lavender Oil.  Lavender Oil stops the horrible itch for some hours.  Don't put Lavender oil on neat it may sting or even burn always mix it with some ointment/gel.,1
"I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma(in situ) at the base of my spine. Aldara cream was prescribed.  Within one week of starting the treatment I had developed polymyalgia rheumatica.  It last for two and a half years.  My sedimentation rate was normally 6, but my rate went up to 97. I went to an extremely good rheumatologist, and he managed to cure the polymyalgia rheumatica.  Since the time of me using Aldara cream, I have had two attacks of shingles and my immune system has been compromised.  I am a 61 y.o. female who was extremely healthy (yoga, climbing, hiking, bicycle riding, etc.) I weighed 107 lbs, since using the Aldara and after the steroids needed to clear up the polymyalgia rheumatica, my weight ballooned to l43 lbs, but is now down to 130.  This is a dreadful drug and I would advise any person who is thinking of using it, to find another alternative.  The drug works by turning on certain cytokines in your immune system, but if you read any of the information on Aldara, ""the mechanism of  action of Aldara Cream in treating AK(actinic keratosis) and sBCC (Basal cell carcinoma) lesions is unknown"".  This drug should be banned.  I phoned 3M and told them about by reaction, but I cannot find any report submitted to the FDA, although they told me they would submit my adverse reaction.  I have, however, heard from other people who had a similar experience, and are now, chronically sick.  Please do not take the ALDARA option.",1
"I had several basal cells on my chest and opted to try the Aldara vs surgery. I have used it for 4 weeks 5 days on 2 days off. Honestly, I have been miserable.Flu like symptoms, general crappy feeling, and the pain from the medicine on my skin. Hurts so bad, but if it works it is worth it. ",3
"I was first treated with Aldara in late May 2009, by my second treatment I had flu symptoms.  After five days with what I thought was the flu it went into my lungs and I was diagnosed with Bronchitis.  After a week with Bronchitis, I suffered a severe sinus and ear infection.  It is now middle August 2009 and I still have problems with my ear, even after having a tube put in.  My doctor decided to restart the Aldara treatments and now after my second treatment, I have the flu symptoms again.  Yes it seemed to work on the wart on my cervix, but it's not worth being sick for 2 1/2 months straight and now it's starting again.  I wish I would have researched this site first.",4
"I was prescribed Aldara for 6 weeks, 5x per week. After the first week I had a very high fever, flu symptoms, extremely bad sore throat developed. Feeling very fatigued. Occasional insomnia. I stopped after 2 weeks. Getting difficult to swallow. I'm opting for surgery. I went to my primary care doctor twice during this thinking I had strep. I did mention Aldara. They said I had a virus. I just researched and discovered these were side effects! Switched doctors.",1
ive been using aldara for 2 weeks already. the only thing that i can say so far about this drug is that the itching an burning is absolutely unbearable and i havnt seen my warts getting any better. hopef8ully within the next week or 2 i will see some results but im not sure if ill make it that far. this is the most uncomfortable thing ive ever experienced and am actually considering the surgery instead of this discomfort.,2
"i thought i would never have a normal looking scrotch again, so i tried aldara and surisingly it worked. yes, it did hurt for me. not at first, but by my 4th application it started getting itchy, hurt to touch, and when i urinated and urine would hit the area i was medicating, it would burn. that part sucked, but it was worth it. i feel like a normal girl again! having genital warts always made me feel like a freak, its not like i wanted them, it was like a horrible gift i received. i have a pretty scrotch again, as silly as that sounds, im very happy about the outcome! ",5
"My 10 year old daughter has been using this for 3 days after the dermatologist prescribed it for a huge wart on her elbow.  She had two other warts on her hand which he cut off.  The poor kid has a plantar wart on each foot.  I started her on garlic capsules yesterday.  The dermatologist prescribed 7 x week at night and then 30% salicylic acid in the morning.  He also told me to completely cover it at night with tape, not a bandage.  She hasn't complained of not feeling good but today I notice her scalp had many orange spots on it.  She is getting old enough to take her shower without me helping her with her hair so I don't know if the orange was on her scalp before the medicine or not.  After reading all of these posts, it makes me think that this drug should have not been prescribed for her.  Also, I paid $548 for 24 single use packets although I am still on the first packet. Now I don't know what to do.  I don't think that calling the doctor back is the answer.  He obviously thought he was right.",1
Outragiously overpriced.  Try Canada  for about $180 for 24 'sachets.',3
"I'm a 23 year old female and I was diagnosed with HPV/genital warts about a month and a half ago.  I was given the option to get them burned off or try Aldara.  Because they are in a sensitive spot (my perineum), I opted to try the Aldara.  I was completely freaked out by reading the reviews (severe burning, itching, swelling, etc) but I really didn't have any other appealing option.  I put it on the first time and was waiting for something horrible to happen but nothing ever did.  It  will make the area you put it on more sensitive, almost like chaffing, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.  Because of that there was some itching but I just put Cortizone cream on and the discomfort went away.  I only had 4-5 warts so my case wasn't extreme by any means, but all of them are gone except for the biggest one which has almost disappeared.  I would definitely recommend this as an initial treatment and if your side effects are too uncomfortable than seek alternative treatment (such as acid).  The reason I say this is because my doctor told me that Aldara will ""train"" your body to fight off the warts so they won't keep coming back and you won't have to worry so much about outbreaks.  Even though I'm not done with treatment I've had a pretty good experience.",4
"my dermatologist recommended the treatment as a preventative treatment for actinic keratoses.  i used it twice a week for 12 weeks, during which time dry red patches developed on my forehead at the hairline and above one eyebrow.  also developed two small red spots on my nose.  overall, my skin is now smoother and hopefully i have avoided the development of skin cancers.",5
"I applied the cream as ordered by MD to residents face. She had unsightly growths in the forhead region, black discolored large protruding growths. with -in 4 weeks the areas were falling off. ",5
"I was first perscribed this med. almost 6 years ago(summer 2003) when I was diagnosed with HPV. I only had 3-5 very small ""bumps"" to speak of, so my case was not very severe. During the first week or 2 (about 6 applications) there was some slight skin irritation, but no other side effects bad enough to recall. By the third week the bumps were nearly gone, and I was just concentrated on finishing the percription exactly how the docter had perscribed. Last year, there was still NO of sign of Any worts after 5 years. When getting my Pap, i requested to be tested again. I kept my fingers crossed, hoping that my relatively young body had eradicated this virus...Unfortunately, I still had HPV. One week ago, a dreaded bump (just one) appeared on the outside of my vagina :( It did not go unnoticed, and I immediately made an appt. with the gyno. I'm going down to the drug store later today, and I will make an update as soon as there are signs of remission. The fact that its been almost 6 years since having to deal with this initially, I am very pleased with Aldara! Maybe this time around the HPV might go away forever, but I won't know for awhile if in fact it will ever go away. I'm only 24, and the younger you are, the more likely it is your body can fight and beat this. We will see.",5
"I had small little ""bumps"" pretty much all over here and there on my face! when I went to the dermatologist she said they were indeed,worts! she perscribed aldara. The first symptoms were pretty much everything that everyone has shared....flu like,headache,heart pounding,swolen lymph nodes,even my bottom lip sweeled! Including red,swolen,itchy,burning,patches! I was nervous...until I found this website!! so thank you all. Its been 8wks,and their going away slowly but surely!! just dont stop using till clear,cause its starts all over again!!",4
"Used all over face 1x/week for 10 weeks in 2006 for several tiny bccs on central face and to catch any non-visible ones. The diagnosed bccs were no longer find-able by Mohs surgeon at 12 weeks, so no surgery necessary then. Now, two other suspicious areas cropped up and derm prescribed Aldara 2x/week for central face area only.  Flu-like symptoms with fatigue, coughing both treatment times. spots come up red and look bad in weeks 3-5, then only kind of red on day 2 after each treatment, coinciding with the fatigue. severity of flu reaction varies with how much cream I use.  THis time I wear latex gloves to apply, try to use very little, and wash off thoroughly in am.  Nearly finished with treatment, will update after treatment ends and MD checks sites. (just fyi Doc says 20% of people lack some receptor that makes the medicine work.  Its an immune response modifier, so I'm not surprised it has some systemic effect).",4
"  I followed my Dr's advice on how to use this medication and although it was a bit uncomfortable, I stuck with the treatment and it worked really well.  After I was done with the treatment, the warts have not come back.  ",5
"I have been using this for a few weeks and have little reaction to it and it worked good in the areas it was applied in.   On my follow up, I had 9 more warts in different areas so my my doctor said I cover more area and since I have been lucky and not had a reaction we have upped the frequency to 5 days a week. So now I have shaved it all and cover the entire genital and pubic. I don't know of any full body latex condom suits to protect from the pubic area, and that is where mine started. :)  3 days in of the 5 days a week, I am yet to have any reaction, even after using it 3 days a week for the past 8 weeks. I could continue to just get them frozen off but some have come back afterward AND this drug has the potential for building up your immunity to the warts to begin with. That is the single reason I requested it and will deal with the discomfort (if it appears) for the 8 week treatment I am on. If it means I could get rid of these and stop being reminded of my ex spouse's infidelity then I will make that sacrifice for myself and for the relationship I still must have with her because of the kids. (Forgiveness is a daily thing)  I know many are having bad side effects, but from I have reviewed here and other places it is worth it to ""man up"" and just try to get through it. I know I may not be suffering like some of you (yet), but I encourage all of you to do that. You owe it to yourself to try and overcome this completely.",4
ALDARA cleared up my gw's in 11 treatments i had a application left even though i applied a couple of times after they were already gone i didnt feel anything but i seen it was really red and slippery when i wore my panties on however the dr told me to apply at night so i wouldnt feel discomfort really during the day i mean who wants to deal w side effects during their normal time of being awake ??? i have heard alot of reviews and get scared thinking its going to happen to me i think i followed it right ... i applied directly on the wart my bf even helped me but i did it my self after that and washed my hands i applied it mon wed fr and left the weekend free but yes NO SEX during that time your already emotionally confused pls dont want to spread it or make it worse .... BUT ALDARA WORKED GREAT I RECOMMEND IT ,5
I had 4 AK's frozen this past summer and now in the last days of using the cream on forehead and cheeks.  No side effects and it seems to be doing the job on about 15 areas which have scabbed.  Did see doc at day 18 and she was fine with the treatment. I do have a swollen lymph node on one side of under ear and looking for it to disappear following end of treatment.  ,5
"Used Aldara on my nose for 6 weeks, 3times per week in 2003. The basal cell did not return.  It did cause flue like symptoms. In 2006 I was advised to use it on my lower lip twice a day for 14 days.  After the 6th day during the night I had a very rapid heart beat.  I stopped the treatment right then.  My advice, watch out when using this drug.",4
"My husband was prescribed this treatment in October, 3 months supply to ba taken 5 night out of 7.  No follow up in-between & no questions asked re his general health (blood pressure etc.) Admitted to hospital with heart failure - very rapid heart beat, swelling with fluid retention and extremely high blood pressure in December.It took me to look up the Aldara web site & find these can be rare side effects.  Perhaps the drs should at least take your blood pressure before prescribing this cream, from something that is not serious to making something life threatening. Please take care with this. ",1
"Have been using Aldara 2X wkly for one month, and it has brought out some very red, scaly, sore patches on my forehead and under my nose and above my lip. Went to 3X daily to include the dorsal side of my hands and I experienced flu-like symptoms and diarrhea. Have used before and got very smooth, soft skin and fading of age spots. Dr. recommended I use this in lieu of repeated skin cancer surgeries. Difficult to experience when the redness and soreness is in full bloom, but the ultimate results are really worth it.",5
"Warts on the scalp and face that did not respond to freezing by a dermatologist.  It takes a minimum of 3 months to see improvement, but it does happen and it seems to last.",4
"While preferred over surgery,  the side effects of headache, flu-like symptons, and joint pain made it difficult to tolerate. ",2
"I kinda sound like everyone else ,, Im on my second week itchy red areas on my forhead. I know its working. I am only useing it twice a week. And today Im really itchy. I think I am going to just apply it to the areas that are red after next week. I have no other symptoms so far. ",4
"Hello,Stramber here again. Found something to help somewhat with the BURNS around anus + genitals other areas. Sudocrem Zinc Oxide cream for burns.  Use only small amounts 3 times a day. The burning + allergic reaction is Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.  Doctors tell me only time will stop the burning from inside to the outside  !       ",1
"I was diagnosed with HPV- Genital Warts about two weeks ago. My Dr. prescribed me with a month supply of Aldara cream to make the warts go away. Never once did she inform me just how strong this cream is and/or what happens if you use too much of it. I must of used a little too much and I now have severe burns on, around, and in my vaginal area. I can barely sit, walk, move, and when it comes to urinating I don't even want to think about it. This is by far the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in a long time. I've yet to know if it even works because I've only used the medication twice. I suggest if you use it or are going to use it, make sure you get all of the facts about it and don't use a lot. I would never wish this pain on anyone and the sad part is I asked my Dr. what I could do to reduce the swelling and constant burning and all she could offer were baths and cold packs. Doesn't help.",1
"I had a small spot on my neck and started applying Aldara about four weeks ago. It is now about 1.5 in, scabby and it hurts. It is an open sore, skin is tight, burning sensation and I have been nauseaous.  Not sure if that is direct cause or not. I am hopeful it will do its job, but this is difficult to look at and uncomfortable. Wearing a lot of turtlenecks to hide the sore which also irritates the skin.  Trying to be optimistic - I go back to the doctor in 4 more weeks.  ",3
"Had what looked like age spots all over my face and forehead, the aldara removed all and made my face look younger and very smooth face after treatment.  I guess it was like a chemical peel.  As a teenage back in the 60's had bad acne now face is much nicer very pleased with results, key to using don't use a lot!! Also took off what looks like age spots on my arms.  ",5
"Have been using this for 3 1/2 weeks, 5 times a week.  Dr. said to use it 7 days, for 4 weeks.  Decided I would follow the manuf. instuctions.  My forehead has been bloody, sore, swolen and has spread from a small spot to over 1 1/2"".  Nose area scabbed only after 5 days of use.  Found I could use small packet for all 5 days, very little is needed.  Going to stop due to the pain.  ",1
"Hi all, just update you.  It is now 10 months since I stopped using Aldara for a basal cell carcinoma. After all this time it has been found that use of it gave me Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Allergic reaction to it.  Quite rare apparently but given the fact that only 1 per cent of allergic drug reactions are reported to the FDA it is probably more prevalent than known.  I am burning in the groin and anus still !  I still have hives on tummy and r breast and left elbow with an accompanying red hot itchy rash.   Nothing really works on it -  the only thing that sometime gives relief is Silvazine burn cream (Sulfadiazine Chlorex).  Doctors just tell me I will get better in time (they hope) so do I the burning of my genital area is just horrible and getting me down.   ",1
HOW TO PRESCRIBE,3
"I was prescribed Aldara back in October. My doctor instructed my to apply the cream three times a week for six weeks and then come back for a follow up. The first two applications were fine. I had no reactions and everything was painless. I decided to research Aldara and was overwhelmed by all the negative and horrifying stories, that I decided to stop applying the cream all together. About two weeks passed and in that time I had researched all these home remedies for warts such as apple cider vinegar and vitamin e oil. The apple cider vinegar BURNED!! I could not handle that! I said what the heck and after my skin completely healed from the ACV, I continued using the aldara. I wish I never stopped using the cream! It has been GREAT with getting rid of the warts. There is a SIGNIFICANT improvement and the warts are almost completely gone! Yes my skin was irritated and it does look worse before it gets better. I found that the cream is just as effective if you wait more days in between. It was difficult for me to do every other day because my skin would get irritated and burn and itch. Sometimes I had to wait 2 or three days before applying the cream again but it is better than applying the cream to already irritated skin, as this can be painful and set back healing time. I had to COMPLETELY stop having sex. My skin was so sensitive to the treatment that sex would just make things worse for my recovery. I used a Q-tip when applying the cream because on me, if I applied the cream to areas of my skin that did not have warts then it would get very irritated. I just had my six-week check up and my warts are almost gone. To anyone that has doubts, just hang in there if you can. A lot of the symptoms listed here are common and expected. It gets worse before it gets better and I never imagined that I would look normal again but I do!  ",4
"I have a wort at the edge of a fingernail.  I have had this tx with liquid nitrogen, candidia injected under the nail,now the nail has been removed, 6X's more of L.N., and now Aldera.  I have really good insurance, and they charged me $156.00 for the stuff! My derms told me to apply it nightly and cover with duct tape.  Well I see no miracles.  I am really bummed. I will keep using it....but I am really, really discouraged. ",2
"Follow up to review: Went back to the Dr today for a checkup. The Aldara is working but not fast enough. Now I have to go to every other day and then 2 weeks before Christmas I have to go every day. Said my nose has to turn red & crusty, etc so that he knows its working. During last week of treatment my nose did start to turn red and sore. Not happy but guess its better than surgery which is what I'm trying to avoid. ",3
"When i was diagnosed with genital warts i was so upset yet confused at the same time.  I didn't know who was to blame or where it came from.  After the Aldara treatment i still worried the warts were still there.  At my 6 week check up i still had 2 small ones, considering i had about 9 clumps of warts.  I was relieved and i know it worked.  I am going through the second set of treatment and thank goodness for insurance.  It causes a little chaffing but what medication dosen't have a side effect?  It's natural.  Until i have the full effect and they go away for sure, I'll have my doubts but so far so good.  Good luck to everyone.",4
"Was diagnosed on the side of my nose by the nostril area so I was very worried after my Dr gave me a brochure on this showing pictures of before and after - not to mention reading other people's stories, but so far I have been very fortunate in not having any side effects and my nose looks fine - just the tiny dot of a scar left from the biopsy. I'm in week 5 of an 8 week course. I take it 3x a week, M-W-F and only put a very small amount on like my Dr said to at bedtime and cover with a spot band-aid. I have had only very minor tingling or itching on a couple of occassions that went away after a few minutes. I make sure to clean my face with Oil of Olay wet cloths beforehand and the next morning I use regular Oil of Olay and slather it on really well. Dont know if that helps but it sure doesnt hurt. A few times I have felt queasy and not well the following day after applying but dont know for sure if its a side effect or my hypoglycemia acting up and just stressing about it. My Dr did say if it became bothersome to stop for a few days and use Neosporin and then start up again but I have not had to do this so far. I do love being in control of when I use it on my own timetable.  ",5
Halfway through 6 week course of 5x a week.  Small area on shoulder was just pale pink before starting to use.  Now it's larger and red...has scabbed and quite itchy and uncomfortable during the week during use.  Over the weekend the discomfort lessens.  Not terribly uncomfortable but I hope the scar that's left won't be worse than the tiny spot before.  I have been having lots of mucous in throat and terribly itchy palms of hands.  Now I'm wondering whether those are possible side effects of drug.  Hands making me crazy!,3
I'm on my 4th week of aldara after a biopsy was taken. I asked my dr. about having a plastic surgeon remove the rest of the bascel cells since the area showed on my forearm.I was told to try this and start it before the biopsy wound had a chance to heal. I will be really shocked if I don't have a really bad scar from using this med. It looks really bad.I just hope it does the job and clears up afterward. If I had it to do over I would have had the dermatologist to remove more tissue which was diagnosed to do or gone on to the plastic surgeon.,3
"when I first began this Rx--after a few days I looked terrible--my face looked like I fell in a gravel pit and the gravel wass all stuck to my forehead--that continued for quite awhile-this was using the RX every day for 2 weeks/then began using it only on M-W-F, would start to look barely better and I had to take more--after using all of the packets, afew ddays after stopping, skin became really dry and itchey,,then began to flake off...now my forehead is almost clear just a slight redness",5
"this is the second time i have used aldara. scalp and nose areas. one week to produce results - look horrible, red skin, turning to scaby scaley areas. in 3 weeks begin to heal even without other medication like silverdine. skin then smooth and normal looking. ",5
have not tried--Humana won't pay for this medication--I want to try it-this will cost me $600.00....,1
"wow! what a range of reactions to this stuff. my derm said to use just a small dab on the area where i had the skin cancer..she had removed it and this was a followup..she did tell me that using a lot had would have adverse effects and it must, reading these reviews. i've had no side effects and it works (i guess)..i'll find out next month..have been a user for 6 weeks now",4
"This medication is much more aggressive than others I have used like Effudex, Carac and Solareze.  The reaction to the teated site is severe but if you want to get rid of the cancer without surgery, Aldara is the stuff.  I treated my forehead and back nightly for 14 days.  Severe redness and swelling.  I also treated my lip for 18 days.  That was absolutely miserable but effective.  I would not suggest doing a lot of spots at the same time.",5
My doctor prescribed this medication when large groups of warts started appearing all over my hands. This started after my immune system was weakend by HIV.  I did not want scarring and they coverd my hands.  It took a few weeks and they just diminished in size untill finally drying and peeling off like a scab.  Has worked far better than freezing or the acid in otc products.  Zero side effects!   Well worth the money!  Would highly reccomend! ,5
"The doctor told me the unusual skin patch on my nose was pre-pre cancerous BCC.  A few days after I started applying the creme, it looked worse.  The doctor's guidance was to take a break of a few days, then try again, once every two days.  It is working!  It also worked for a large patch of keratonisis. NOT USUALLY MENTIONED IN THESE REVIEWS BUT WORTH NOTING: one envelope may be sufficient for 2-3 applications.  At the recomendation of my doctor, I use only the tiniest of dabs, and it works.  It helps avoid the severe reactions, and it still heals. I still have several weeks to go before I see the final results, but so far, so good!",4
"I had a little grouping of about 3 or 4 warts in the area between my vagina and anus. In two weeks time these warts were completely gone with Aldara. This medicine worked great however it was uncomfortable. After a few uses the area became sore and irritated but the outcome was worth a little discomfort. My doctor said she believes this is the best treatment for warts, as it doesn't leave scars and it may help prevent new warts from growing in the same area. This medicine is very expensive though, a one month supply with no insurance runs about $300, so obviously insurance helps. But a little of this medicine goes a long long way so you can make the medicine (and your money) go much further by only using a half packet at a time.",5
"Awful, I was prescribed this for genital warts and it gave me painful sores as well as itching, burning, flaking skin. I would highly recommend using something else.",3
When I started the Aldara my warts got even bigger and the pain was so terrible that I couldn't sit down.  I kept at the treatment though and my warts are almost compltely gone in less than 5 weeks.  I think it works better for some people that others.,4
"This made new sores and hasn't helped the warts I've had. I have only used it twice, and I cannot walk because the pain is so unbarable. I would just rather have these warts or get them frozen off then continue to use this product.",1
Am still having Adverse Events from this even tho stopped 5 l/2 months ago. Used on BCC on my leg.  Getting all sorts of infections still and mucos in the throat I think it attacks the mucos membranes.  Adverse reactions - affected genitals which is often the case in allergic reations.  Plus Hives on tummy - Phenergan an antihistamine gave some relief although still have the hives and red rash (erythema) but are getting smaller.  For the Anus and genital area this drug seems to have set up an eczma of this area giving an itch - little lumps under the skin like a nettle rash ! and red sore skin with sweating of that area and watery blisters.Can't bear to wear undies - only skirts.     For the eczma take some Eve.Primrose Oil x 3 caps a day.  Get a good brand name (not generic) cortisone cream rub in then I found a Dermeze Ointment on after that.  Sometimes a baby's rash powder helped.  Please if your have had success with treating the side effects let us all know.,1
"I have had to discontinue treatment because of oozing, bleeding open sores that formed, with extreme redness and lumpiness in the areas of my face where I am applying it.  Also itching  and burning. I will see the doctor and start over if she advises me to do so later.",2
"I had several warts and after about 6 weeks of treatment the warts subsided somewhat but due to the severe side effects of Aldara, I absolutely had to stop treatment.  Itching, burning, chaffing, scabbing, blisters, soreness, etc...  I could not bear it anymore and just had to stop the treatment.",3
"I had one or two little warts, and they really freaked me out. I put this on, and yes.. it makes things a little sensitive, but I saw results in as little as a week. By two weeks, they were both gone. I used half of one little package for each application because a little goes a long way, and I did that every other day. I also tried to have an extremely healthy diet and drink lots of water. This drug gave me fantastic results.",5
"Unacceptable skin reaction - swollen, rough, red, burning and intense itching as welll as extreme sensitivity to clothing, fresh air or heat of any kind.  Miserable.",1
"I had 3 BCCs removed with surgery which was a hassle to deal with for weeks afterward and left ugly white scars.  My doctor allowed me to try this medication on another one.  It was very sore and itchy for a while but he prescribed a cream which helped with the reaction.  After the treatment time, the BCC was completely gone with no scars.  I much prefer this method and am using again on new lesions.  The irritation is well worth the final outcome.  Use only as prescribed and just cover the area.",5
"At week 4 of 12 week treatment 3 x's a week. So far I have had no problem other than peeling skin. I have 3 sites where basal cell carcinoma was removed. One of the sites had some remaining cells so my Dr. prescribed this med. This a rather large area - 3""x 1"". All the cells were removed from the other 2 sites. ",3
"Was a difficult 90 day treatment, blisters, burning, etc. Was tempted to quit several times.  So glad I didn't, my skin is beautiful...looks like a young woman and I'm 58. Get compliments all the time. No more suntanning for me...just fake tan's.",5
"Dermatoligist prescibed Aldara for squamous cell carcinoma in the genital area , mostly the rectal area. I find nothing that insist that Aldara is used to treat this condition. I see only Basel cell carcinoma is treated with Aldara.Can you clear this up for me. Thanks",1
Horrific Adverse events with it.  Burnt my genitals and anus and blisters.  Red hot welt and hives on tummy.  Itch hives and blisters and boils has driven me mad and NOTHING works on it.  Not cortisone cream nothing !  Am getting all manner of infections.  Hurt my hearing now get an echo.  My sight is not as good.  ,1
"I am finishing up week 4 with this drug on a basal cell located on my back. My back if very sore and all around the treated area is red, swollen and irritated. I am not bleeding from it.",3
"Terrible, i rather stay with the warts, to experience such horrible side effects, weak,headaches, and not to tell you about the skin reaction that interfere with my daily activities. I felt like dying. I have use this cream only twice in 5 days. Please ask your Dr. for any other treatment.",1
"I was very satisfied with this product. I was sceptical at first because of some of the reviews that I read on this website but I only had one reaction and it was just a small sore. My advise to anyone that uses this product is to use very little amounts on the wart, small enough to barely cover the surface of the wart. Another thing is that if you do get a sore you can use Neosporin on it if it is external, wait until it clears up and then continue the use. Dont be afraid of some of the reviews just use as directed and you should be fine, but its different for everyone.",5
"I haven't satisfied at all with aldara cream. To be honest with you I am kind of confused because, two times, already I have developed terrible side effects like blisters and I don't know if it is actually a side effect or if maybe I have herpes. I'm kind of worry and scared of going to the doctor.",2
"I was told to use only at bedtime 3 days a week.. mine cleared up in as quick as two weeks. I am very happy with this medication and had no side effects to it. Everyone's body is different.. it's worth giving it a try..   also it has been 2 years since I was diagnosed with genital warts and that is when I started using Aldara. I only had to use a couple of weeks, and have had one minor outbreak since. I would recommend this to anyone..",5
Did GREAT!!!,5
"I am on week 5 of a 6week treatment for BCC on my chest.  The BCC was the size of a pencil eraser and after applying Aldara it is now 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Very itchy, thick, and altogether disgusting looking.  My derm says it's doing its job.  It made areas nearby flare up and I was told I have other skin damage that the drug is finding.  I will be glad when this is over next week.",4
"This totally worked for me!  I went 8 weeks without any kind of treatment before going to the doctor and having her prescribing this for me.  I was skeptical and waited another month before getting the Rx filled.  I saw results in just two days!!  After 6 weeks of treatment, my warts have completed cleared up.",4
Used aldara on my external genital warts for about 3-4 months. Few side effects..however when applied to healthy skin it blistered. Cleared my first outbreak in about 8 weeks..then had another outbreak which it cleared again. I recomend waiting it out..it took about 6 weeks to start working for me.,4
Dont wast youre time!! I have had my genital warts froze off 2x and this is the second pescription i have recieved. NO RESULTS. I'm gonna cut it all off and be done with it.,1
"The area being treated is my upper chest, the area typically exposed in a bathing suit.  This medication has been difficult...large red sores, burning, itching.  Difficult to keep on for 8 hours and takes 2-3 days to recoup. Business owner and interfering w/that.",2
"side effects, skin blisters on my hose and cheeks, my face is red from my cheeks to my chin.  An other web page medical report ""skin color changes that do not go away"".  Stay away from Aldara.  I stopped after about three days. ",1
"I went to the doctor for my annual 2 weeks ago and my doctor noticed a wart on my vulva. I told her that I though genital warts or HPV can be detected through pap exams or blood work (which came back normal) and she said no it cannot so you never know who is carrying this STD. She told me if you want to get rid of it quick we'll remove it with acid which where it was located did not hurt vs. if it was on the actual vagina it would be something else. After she applied the acid she mentioned that it would wash off in a few days later. I was given a prescription for aldara to help build my immunity in the small area where the wart was located. The first three days was ok with no reaction. I've only used this product for 6 days. This medication is so strong that I have broken out in mini sores all of the side of my vagina where I did not apply the medication. The medication must have rub up on the places where I didn't apply it over night. I do not recommend this product to anyone the side affects can affect your daily activities. I've also experienced severe itching after the cream has been applied, burning when I urinate so I have to lean away from the infected site, little sores after just using it for a short period of time, tingling throughout the day (a lord don't let your underwear pull on the site getting treated), etc. The instructions on the box mentioned that if you have severe reaction to stop using the  product until the body heals but I do not think that I will be finishing the rest of that box any time soon. For now, if I have another outbreak I will only use the acid which was less painful and quicker. If you are reading this make sure you take heed to what all of us are saying because I wish I would have read this before paying for this expensive drug and then using it!",1
I've tried this medication twice for BCC on the chest and I became extremely toxic both times so I stopped using it after 3-4 weeks (out of 8 week prescriptions).  I experienced every extreme side effect and recently learned that this drug can be dangerous long term.  I'm looking for alternatives and I don't recommend it.,2
"I have been using Aldara for 8 days. I have developed a tingling sensation around my mouth, nose, have come out in a rash around the area treated on other side of face (not treated) on my chest!!! and have also developed a mucus throat!!!",1
I have finished seven doses and have not received any results.,1
"I ended up in the emergency room because aldara gave me such a severe reaction, after only three uses, and I was prescribed pain killers, which still did not help. My advice- ask your doctor for ANY other treatment. ",1
i didn't like it at all! it did nothing for me  but to make me itchy and very uncomfortable. i couldn't do anything.    ,1
"aside effect for me was sore and sensitive mouth and tongue, initally severe (couldn't even use toothpaste) then milder.  also absolutely killed my taste buds.  they came back about a month or two after i stopped using aldara.",4
I found with shorter periods of treatment(4-8hrs) I didn't get any sores.,3
"So bad, I would rather live with genital warts. It did nothing for me except cause itching burning and a bad skin reaction!",1
"WORKED LIKE A CHARM. I had a large wart on the palm of my hand, which was difficult to remove and often painful. I had tried freezing it off at the dermatologists twice and nothing happened. I was givnen Aldara and i put it on at night under a bandaid and washed it off in the morning for about 7 dyas. I stopped using it and within a week the wart had totally fallen off and it has never come back. No scarring either.",5
These warts are not going away and I'm getting tired of putting this stuff on. I wish I could just have them cut out.,1
"The side effects of this medication are horrible. I would have rather had the small area cut out or use some other medication, than deal with all the headaches, backaches etc. Oh not to mention I looked like I had leprecy.",3
trichloracidic acid works much better and faster,2
"I had Basal cell cancer on my neck and was given the cream to apply. The 3rd day of using it I found tightness in my chest and called the hospital. They did tests such as blood test, EKG and Xray, although they came back negative they admitted me over night. The next day I did a stress test, more blood work and echocardiogram, which all came back negative. They released me and 2 days later I started using the cream again. Guess what came back, yup the tightness in my chest. Stopped using the Aldara cream and tightness never came back. Had the basal cell removed by Mohn’s.    ",1
"Adverse reactions!! Started this four weeks ago to treat sun damaged skin above right temple. Used this before a decade ago without incident aside from hideous red lesion it produces.  This time it caused a rash across my chest and back.  My arthritis in shoulders, lower back, hands and wrists has flared up since starting this treatment series.  Also am experiencing low energy and increased dizziness.  Was supposed to continue for another two weeks but I'm feeling so lousy and the redness is spreading down my cheek and towards my eye. I start to feel better during the rest days but then start down the tubes after resuming treatment, where the last day of the cycle is the worst. Am discontinuing this and hopefully the hideous scaly redness will give way to some better looking skin in a few weeks.",4
Side effects!! Started using this on a sun damaged patch of skin above my right temple.  Nasty rash formed on my chest and back. My arthritic joints have been severely aggravated after starting this. Right hand is nearly unusable.  Low energy and dizzy.   Noticed these symptoms abate during the two day rest period. Treated area is gross looking as expected but is starting the spread way outside the treated area towards my cheek and eye. Stopping after four weeks.  Not worth feeling lousy day in and out. Have used this stuff years before without side effects but was younger then.  ,4
"I have used this off andon for 8 years. I respond well and the repeat lesions are much less. I have hundreds of AK lesions on face, arms, chest. We treat one area at a time, so it takes time. I hate the redness, itching and crustiness, but have no systemic effects. Why better than alternatives, i am a very pale skinned person who grew up in sunny CA. Now I never expose my skin to sun and look much better. It works, but has local effects. I mainly treat in winter. Face is all clear, chest has been longer treatment, but had worse disease. ",4
I have applied 4 times and the area itches and burns. My skin has a rash/reaction. Not sure if this is suppose to happen. Will call my dr on monday.,3
"I had MOHS done on a BCC on the side of my nose about 14 years ago, and the surgeon was down to cartilage in two ""shavings"". He was a butcher! Then I had another show up on my cheek. I asked my dermatologist if there was another method and he put me on the Aldara. 6 weeks & it was gone - no side effects  Fast forward to today. A new BCC on my temple. I am 4 weeks into treatment with same progress, but I am blimping up with water and my blood pressure is thru the roof. Just got a diuretic to see if that will help. Not sure whether or not the Aldara has caused this, but it is listed as a rare side effect. No matter, I will stay the course, because I won't get MOHS or the radiation treatment. This stuff does work.",5
"I don't yet know if it has worked on the scaly patches on my cheek.  At present, after 4 applications, my face is a mess of draining pus-filled sores, swollen hard red bumpy skin.  Looks too awful to go out.  Plus I am running a fever and feel horrible.  Have now discontinued (on doctor's advice).",2
"After one week of using for genital warts, I experienced fatigue, fever, diarrhea, nausea and had no appetite. I felt like I was in a fog. I have missed one dose and now fill maybe 25 percent more normal.  Not a good experience for me. At first I thought I had the flu and kept using it but finally realized it had to be the medication. ",1
"I wish they were bigger packages of it, pretty hard to use that little pack on half your face.I have some spots that feel like I had a zit on my face but it's the pre cancer. I've been taking it every day till all 48 treatments are done. Skin cancer sucks",4
I used the medication as directed with caution.  Saw absolutely no response of any sort.  Thought perhaps it might be a counterfeit and notified FDA.  They are investigating.,1
"I had a finger tip sized basal cell on my chest. After biopsy showed invasive basal cell I was given the option of MOHs or Aldara with both outcomes as equal. Dr said this would leave little to no scar. I am just finishing my third of six weeks of treatment. Area is now 6 cm with shingles like vesicles. It aches, itches, burns, and looks awful. Generalized arthralgia with some anorexia and headaches. Hard to believe from just this tiny bit of cream. I guess it's worth it if it works, I suppose this reaction means it's working. I also have one on my ankle but I have had no response to the cream on my ankle lesion. Three more weeks to go. Good to read other's responses, misery loves company.",4
"I used this cream for treatment of a planters wart. Worked great on the warts! The side effects are crazy though...the first week I was very sick, the second and third weeks I had extremely bad welts on my face. They went away once I stopped using the cream. ",5
While using the medication I experienced many of the side effects enumerated within the article. ,1
I used the cream on my entire face and chest for 9 days before I had to stop.  I experienced nausea/vomiting/diarrhea.  I have had dizziness and profound tiredness.  I have ulcers on my lips which are extremely painful.  I feel like I have the flu all the time.  Think it is working on the pre-cancerous lesions though!!!,5
"I've used this as needed for the past 15 years.  It works as stated, and I've had no side effects with it.  You do have to deal with the affected area as your body attacks it.  It inflames, it can be itchy.  You also have to consider it an open sore, so keep it clean, don't put it in stagnant water.  Ointment and a small round bandage might help.  I recently got a new prescription, and had 3 packets left over from prev prescript.  I coated my forearms and had about 7-9 BCC's light up and faded away.  That's 7-9 I would not need biopsied, so that's worth it in my book.",5
"Treated a BCC in nose bridge (couldn't afford the deductible  for Mohs.) Also a small pre-cancerous patch under my lip. After 11 days a large area between nose and eye were ulcerated, inflamed and infected. Eye swollen half shut. Stopped treatment and started wound car/antibiotics but kept treating the lower lip lesion per MD instructions. 4 days later my upper AND lower lips are ulcerated. Paid $300 out-of-pocket for 24 pkts and used 4. My dermatologist says this ""exuberant response"" is a good thing. I am NOT so sure.  Effudex wasn't this bad. Also have had headache/fatigue",3
"I had a very severe allergic reaction to Imiquimod.  I was prescribed the cream to apply to a mole on my right arm that my dermatologist had diagnosed as basal cell carcinoma.  I applied the cream on the mole as directed- once a day, five days a week.  About two weeks into treatment, my arms and calves began to feel itchy.  Within a week, the itchiness had spread to my chest. I was also developing small bumps that looked like white head pimples on my chest.   The third week I discontinued using the cream, but now the bumps had spread up my chest to my neck and face, as well as to my upper back.  The iching became more frequent, to the point where I was so uncomfortable that I could not sleep at night without a sedative.  After about two weeks of stopping the use of the cream, my face and neck cleared up and the bumps began to fade.  However the itchy skin persisted, as did a few of the bumps on my chest and back.  My allergist prescribed prednisone to try to clear these final effects, and it worked- the itching and bumps went away.  However, once the steroid was gone, the bumps and itchiness came back.  I am now eight weeks from the last time I used imiquimod cream, and the bumps and itching are still here.  Planning another visit to the allergist to see what other options I might have.",2
"Cleared up the Actinic Keratosis on my lip.  It is very easy to apply.  The side effects for me were terrible.  I have aching joints and fatigue.  My lip is a mess.  My bottom lip is one big scab.  I have oozing sores and very painful on my lip...top and bottom. I wake up to my lips stuck together and blood and fluids on my pillowcase.  I'm trying to remind myself it's better than the other options, laser and surgery.",4
"Superficial BCC, small spot on chest. Taking this 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Im on week 3 and hadn't really noticed any major side effects until now. Currently experiencing nausea & diaherrea and VERY dry lips. Cant put enough chapstick on! Headaches daily since the day I started the cream. No darkening or scabbing yet as others have reported. Not sure if that means it isn't ""working"" yet or not. I will update review at the end of my 6 weeks. ",3
"I had actinic keratosis on chest, face, shoulders, lips. I have been using imiquomod for over a year, off and on as tolerated, restating sites of treatment. I have a strong reaction, including open lesions with bleeding. However, it cleared up over 100 lesions. I have had recurrence as 10% of lesions recur. I have excepted this is lifetime treatment. The worst is on my lips, and treatment is painful.",4
"Perscribed for two nearly invisible AK spots on face. Now done 12 days of first round. As advertised: starts working day 1 with very mild pain, redness, progresses to VERY pronounced darker area, then scab-like. DEFINITELY an immune reaction working, affecting only the AK tissue even deep under the surface. Doing the job so far. Amazing action for a topical. Downside: looks like I was hit with a tire iron. That part not explained to me. Otherwise might have just gone for the freeze thing, if it's going to scar.",4
"Been on Imiquimod 5% cream for BCC on face fwd of LH ear for a little over 1 wk.  Following prescription schedule of 5 days on, off Sat Sun. Will continue for another 5 weeks. Apply nightly with Q-tip.  Area is slightly swollen, redness, slight pain, itching, scabbing, tender to touch, and looks horrible.  Must be working as planned, effects match expectations.",5
"Have been using 5% for a month now,and have yet to see any results on my warts.",1
"I was prescribed Imiquimod (Aldara) in 2009 for several genital warts 3 times weekly for 6 weeks by my gynekologist. After the 6th treatment I became very weak, my vagina swell up to the size and colour of half a capsicum and I became severe sinusitis (in summer!). Therefore I stopped the treatment. It took several weeks for my sinuses and vaginal swelling to dissappear. Since then I am permanently left with LOSS OF SMELL! In order to find out whether this was a coincident I started treatment again in 2011. When I became the same symptoms again within 2 days of the first application I stopped. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND this drug. Doctors and Pharmacists were not able to warn me of this drug due to lack of necessary information.",1
"Treating 2 BCC on leg. Itches, burns, shock like feeling thru leg. Leg aches. Had to take tylonal too often for pain & discomfort. Dr says it is working good, and will not leave a scar. It is horrible looking and starting to smell. Don't know if I would go through this treatment again.",4
Within 2 days of using this on my chest it starts reddening.  Third day it starts itching and gets worse from there.  I used it on my right chest first and had to quit after 1 week due to blistering SO bad.  If I can afford more I'll keep trying --maybe!,2
"I used it 7 days a week for 5 weeks and it had absolutely no effect on my skin.  I had blocked the time on my calendar, now I have to redo for another 6 weeks with fluoroplex and have a busy schedule.",1
"This drug has causesd nausea, diarrhea, and weakness.",2

Didnt work @ all. the packs were so little it wasnt enough to treat the effected areas.,1
well lets put it this way! it cost me 400$ for 12 tiny single pkgs and there was absolutely no sign of shrinkage or disappearance of any kind. i myaswell have put jerkins lotion on and enjoyed it for 2$. word of advice get them frozen off first then burned off if cryopen is not available. i got screwed out of 400$ this stuff does not work dont waste your money trust me. you can take that advice to the bank. if you dont believe me go ahead and waste your money on it. i cannot believe the drug companys would create smthn so expensive that they know doesnt work i do not believe it was experimented on an actual human maybe under a microscope not attached to a human body where virus is stored.,1
"I am still using this.  I have had several of the less severe reactions, headache, diahrea, back ache, muscle and joint problems.  They are annoying but if this works,it'll be worth it! ",2
"Imiquimod is simply the generic/scientific name for the brand name Aldara, so all of the Aldara reviews work for Imiquimod.  My dermatologist prescribed this cream to apply for 8 hrs/day, 4-5 days/wk, in conjunction w/ monthly freezings of a very large wart on the ball of my left foot near my toes.  The location and size of the wart, plus having multiple, severe spinal injuries, made it nearly impossible for me to apply the medicine to my foot by myself.  Even with some help, placing and keeping an adhesive bandage over the medicated wart was nearly impossible.  Still, I could feel the effects of the medication working - just not well enough to handle a wart that had been there for over 10 yrs.  In the end, surgery was required to remove the wart.  Of course, being a 39 yr old, medically retired, 100% disabled veteran since 2004 after 15 yrs of service (which I loved), AND being in what I believed was a monogamous relationship, I recently developed outbreaks of genital warts.  HPV is one of those crazy viruses that you can carry forever and not know it, and it can be transmitted in countless ways, so only God knows how, when, where I contracted the virus.  It's just another fun joke on a veteran already suffering greatly and fighting never-ending battles w/ the government attempting to get started on Social Security Disability and have the VA increase my official disability rating from 90% to 100%.  There are plenty of funds available for bailing out big businesses, but we can't take care of our so-called ""heroes"" in America.  I didn't even get a parade when I was retired as a Captain after 15 yrs of exceptional service.  Long live King Dollar!!!",2

"I have cll and my cell count was over 100,000,so that was the reason for chemotherapy. This drug, after five months of treatment, my cell count fell to 0. Now I am in remission. I know I am incurable ,but I am glad this drug can help me.",5
"Started on Carboplatin and alimta in April, 2012.  Now off Carbo, just on alimta.  Doing well.  No major side effects.  Flushed cheeks, swollen ankles (take diuretic), watery eyes. No nausea.  I drive to and from my appointments by myself.  Dr. says I'm ""in remission"" for now.  Continuing Altima every 3 weeks -- indefinitely.  I am given a steroid before each alimta treatment.  That's what causes the flushed cheeks, I'm told, not the Alimta.  At this point my doctor and I are satisfied with the results/  I pray they will continue to be good results.",5
"second round of chemo for my husband. Has done well. He has had 27 treatments so far but now had to stop because of fluid retention of body and around lungs. Had to have both lungs tapped to drain fluid but body is still up. Not sure if treatments will resume or not. A little worried cause it has kept cancer quiet, now that he is off, the question is will it start to grow again. He was diagnosed a little over 3 years ago.",5
"**Sighing**ALIMTA Is Ok I Guess I Have Had 3 CHEMO Treatments So Far. I Have NAUSEA But my Dr. Gave Me ZOFRAN Which Is Good; And I Also Eat Sliced LEMON Quarter SomeTimes.

Have only had 3 treatments thus far. Wont know for another month if it made a difference. First 2 treatments went good and this last one I was sick for 9 days! Dont know why.,3
"Second round of chemo for my husband. This time he's being given carboplatin IV along with Alimta IV. First time in 2006 he was given Carboplatin IV, Avastin and had to take Tarceva daily (pill form).Too soon to tell if this combination is effective. His appetite is good, no nausea, no hair loss this time. Will do x-ray later this month and go for third treatment. One more treatment after that. I believe in ""miracles"". This thing called ""cancer"" will go into remission. ",4
"This is my husband's second line of Chemo after Carbo and Taxotere which worked well until it was doing more harm than good.  Now he has anemia and neutropenia? but neither are in dangerous category.  His appetite is starting to come back and he has only a little nausea with Alimta.  So far we are very pleased, but he will have scans after his next round on the 23rd of Nov. 2010 and we will better know how it's doing.  Renegade, is this your first time Chemo or maintenance or just second line Chemo?",3
"I just had my 7th monthly treatment as part of monthly maintainence plan.  My cancer was tumors around the lymph nodes of my bronchial tubes. So far, no serious side effects other than a little tiredness.  Have had 2 PET scans and both results have been NO CANCER! PRAISE GOD!",5
"After 3rd treatment, too soon to tell effectiveness.  Noticed some weakness and ill feelings starting 4 days after treatment and lasting for a week.  Had nausea but proton pump inhibitors worked fine.  Am starting Tarseva so must eliminate Prevacid and find another means to control vomiting",3
"I have all the classical symptons. It has zaped me from the start. I have taken one dose with the next one in a week. Never have I been so weak. Hoping this drug helps me and others.Wondering if the drug is worth the pain.Perhaps if the outcome is good I will report differently, but if it doesn't then taking this isn't worth all the suffering. I rather just let the cancer take its course and let the life cycle end. ",1
"My second chemo session in remission since Jan 08 Had mouth ulcers bad, first treatment found gardeling with salt water after each meal helped,Just had my third tretment had  head and costipation sorted this OUT with Lactocur and coloxyl tabs finding itdifficult to stop nausea.Had a scan Cancer has decreaased in size hope it keeps up I keep happy only way I can cope. Can not walk far  Good Luck and health too you all",3
"It's hard for me to rate Alimta because I've only had 1 treatment.  This is my second chemo session.  My cancer was only in remission for about 6 months.  I have a ton of mouth sores and I also have a skin rash.  I'm somewhat depressed, but I think that's more from the fact that I have to go thru chemo again more than the drug causing the problem.  I;m also very tired.  I hope tht this time works for me and I pray that I never have to have chemo again.  I'm praying that Alimta does the trick, no matter what the side effects.",3
"I've had it twice and all I can see is that the lymph Nodes in my neck are getting bigger and more sore, and my COPD has gotten worse.

"Take drug 4 days, stop 6 weeks and take again. This drug caused nearly all the side effects listed on the product.  Side effects begin with taking drug and get worse thereafter.

"Six hours after receiving Aloxi injection, experienced horrible headache that near migraine level.  I have had a couple of migraines in my life but not a chronic problem.  Had to use ice pack alternatively with heat to get relief and my pain pills did nothing (percoset) for relief.  48 hours after dosing, was given Fioriset to help control pain. Didn't have nausea from the chemo but did from the migraine.  Dr. will try something different next infusion.",5

Given dexamethasone pills, Emend pill, and IV palonosetron (Aloxi) IV before chemo drug infusions.  No nausea or vomiting on chemo day.  I do need to use Emend, dexamethasone, Zofran, Compazine, and Xanax to control nausea on other days.  Also use Colace and Senokot as needed to resolve constipation caused by chemo and anti-nausea drugs.  Recommend Aloxi highly.  Oh, another comment:  someone said they were told that the anti-nausea effects of Aloxi last for a week.  That is not so.  Aloxi can only be given once a week.",5

I credit this to the complete combination of drugs, and to dedicated medical care from my oncologist. ",5

"Used this product in conjunction with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) to address actinic keratosis on face. The laser light treatment was a very intense (painful) 17 minute episode. Swelling and sunburn like conditions resulted for several days. After 8-10 days skin healed to a condition far improved to pre-treatment. I am 61 years old and grew up in Florida in the pre-sunscreen era. Very fair skinned. I have developed splotchy areas on my face some of which have progressed into early stage carcinomas. My dermatologist recommended this treatment. I anticipate doing it several times at one or two year intervals. In my opinion, the discomfort resulting from the treatment is well worth suffering through in view of the benefits. Folks commented how it made me look much younger. However, I did not use the treatment for cosmetic reasons, it was to remove ample sun damage that was becoming uncomfortable and a threat to develop into more serious conditions. ",4
This treatment was done in the doctor's office and has worked very well so far. I had a little swelling of the face and some redness. It was almost like a bad sunburn and then the peeling of the skin started the 4-5th day.,5

I am 63 years old and my family health history includes heart problems.       My dermatologist Dr. Ong said he would report this to the FDA.  I as well reported this to the FDA.  All my doctors (dermatologist cardiologist, neurologist have said this was caused by my preexisting conditions, not the aminolevulinic acid (Levulan Kerastick).  As well, the company DUSA said this was not caused by the application.    That being said the pamphlet says aminolevulinic acid has not been tested on people with inherited or acquired blood defects.    I have to go with what the doctors say about  what caused my stroke.

"After taking tamoxifen for 3 years, I developed fibroid tumors in my uterus.  After removal, my oncologist put me on anastrozole.  I have been taking it for 2 1/2 months and have experienced a severe increase of muscle and joint stiffness and pain over the course of the last month and a half.  Some nights I get little sleep because of the pain.  I am a fairly active 67 year old who had Hormone positive breast cancer with a single mastectomy with no radiation or chemo.

Took for 4 days and felt like sh--.  Started reading all reviews and quickly came to decision that 5-10 years on this drug was not worth the poor quality of life it causes.  Now I am taking natural supplement OncoPLEX.  I can't tell you if it works but I have no side effects and will continue to take it.  Good luck to all of you that stay on drugs.

They put me on the anastrozole in January 2015.  I had so many health problems beginning about 12 months after that......I had loss of hair, nails, crepe-like skin....and much more.  Now it has been over 3 years and I have a heel  spur, ankle pain, more and more knee pain ..... and about 3 weeks ago I woke up unable to hardly move my legs.....and my piriformis musle was shortened.....and  tugging on my sciatica nerve......I an still in tremendous pain....I took myself off of the anastrozole to save my life......I had many more of the symptoms, as in weight gain, blurred vision, confusion, weakness, no flavor in my food......and the list goes on and on.....I wound up in the emergency room with heart pains and now they see a lump on the adrenal gland area.......

Have had aching in wrist, at thumb joints, tingling in finger tips during day. At night get over warm, have had pain on side of  a foot enough to wake me up. I just work though wait for it to slow down or go away for the next bout. Nothing at the same time good thing.  The good this is no surgery or radiation and the tumor keeps getting smaller and no new.So far bones are good too. Prayers go out to all",5
"I have been using for 4-1/2 years after refusing chemotherapy.  I have been been experiencing many of the side effects others have mentioned.

At first I had hot flashes but they have mostly subsided.  My biggest problems are extreme pain in my feet and one hip.  I was totally pain free before starting this drug.  I walked fast (uphill) 2 miles every day.  Now I can't walk far and have to walk slowly.  I have right hip pain that makes it hard to sleep sometimes.  I take an over the counter sleeping pill every night which helps.  After about 2 years I started to feel anxiety and depression and have resorted to occasionally taking a low dose Xanax.  Weight gain is another problem.  I had maintained a nice weight for over 10 years prior to taking this drug.  Now I've gained almost 10 pounds.

"I was diagnosed in December 2013 with stage zero DCIS. Had a lumpectomy followed by one week of partial breast radiation. Started anastrozole a month later. I took it for a full year,  UT could no longer deal with the side effects. The main problem was that I had joint pain and there were many days that my body felt like it was made out of lead. There would be days that it felt like my body was so heavy that I could hardly get out of bed. I had some loss of bone density as well. Oncologist wanted me to take a shot for my bones which I declined due to the side effects. My side effects were: hot flashes, extremely decreased libido, night sweats, joint pain, no energy. It was terrible being on this drug. Switched to Tamoxifen and I seem to tolerate it better. It has side effects as well, especially horrible hot flashes, but I have done much better on it. ",1
"AfterDCIS with lumpectomy,radiation,I started on this med.;noticed fatigue, hair thinning, decreased appetite, hot flashes.  The only one that was of great concern for me was the hair thinning.The hot flashes and fatigue were tolerable.",4

I have taken this medication for 5 years after Stage 2 breast cancer and mastectomy. The side effects of extreme hot flashes and dizziness were enough to justify an earlier retirement at 63 from being a preschool teacher.  I chose this treatment as well as surgery and radiation but refused chemotherapy due to it made me extremely ill.  I think the effectiveness and relative lesser degree of side effects makes it a very good choice.,5
"I have been taking this medication for 2 years and 4 months and have been experiencing an increase in joint, muscle and bone pain, especially over the last 12 months.  9 months ago I was taken by ambulance to the hospital for severe back pain (I have spondylolesthesis). I couldnâ??t stand, walk or support myself.  I went back to my Pain Management Doctor who gave me another shot in my back.   Iâ??ve been going to physical therapy to strengthen my back and core muscles. Then my knees started to bother me.  PT helped with that.  Two nights ago I woke up with severe neck pain, throbbing and spasming pain.  Not a day goes by when I do not experience pain. I used to have a high pain threshold, but since chemo, it is nil.  I was originally told that I needed to be on this medication for 5 years.  Now my oncologist is telling me 10.  I donâ??t think I can do it.  Iâ??ve read many comments posted on this board all saying the same things I am saying about the pain.  I am asking any medical person reading these comments to seriously look into this.  Debilitating pain every day in not the best quality of life but the thought of reoccurring cancer is not the best prospect either.  There must be some way to remedy this.",3
Hair loss & loss of appetite,5
"I have been taking this medicine for 3 1/2 yrs now.  I was dx with stage 1 , 1.5cm. I had a lumpectomy and then radiation 2x a day for 5 days through the mammosite.  When I first started taking this medicine I cried all the time for no reason, I knew this wasn't me so back I went to oncologist, he took me off of it for 2 weeks. I resumes about 10 days later. I have been using it ever since with some small side effects , such as hair thinning and some joint pain! Tolerable trade off for a easy treatment.. I was asked if I would remain on med after my 5 yr plan for another 5 yr study, I said yes! I also have been receiving Prolia shots every 6 months for Calcium.. I just had a bone density test done, my bones have thicken and I am no longer receiving the shots. Just oral Calcium and Vit D. ",4
"I had been taking this med for 2 years and having checks up for breast cancer with cancer free results, however since I started taking this med I noticed a decreased on my libido effects.",3
"Diagnosed Stage 1 1.8cm 0/1 node in 3/15,  30 rads,  switched from Tamo to anastrozole 4 months ago.  No side effects except hot flashes some skin changes..so far so good",3
"Was taking tamoxifen for 3.5 years and felt tired all the time. Oncologist said try this instead. The first year was not much different but over time I have become more and more fatigued, already take antidepressant, faint, hot-flashes, weakness, dizzy, joint pain, back ache, head aches, bone pain in my lower legs, lymphedema (had but worse) and now my left leg is tingling, numb and swollen. GP said it was not a blood clot so I believe it's caused by this medication. I've been on hormone therapy for  7 years. Enough is enough. I want my life back. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. ",5
"Only on this for 3 months, and really the only thing is I found is that I am so ""gassey"" and get stomach aches.  Does this happen with anyone else??  For one week I took it every other day and definitely felt better on the days I didn't take it.  My chance for cancer return according to the onco-2 test is only 3%.  Worth staying on this drug?  ",2
"I took this medication for six months following surgery for infiltrating ductal carcinoma. I had surgery and radiation, which was hard enough, but the medication was too hard to tolerate. Overall pain, much like fibromyalgia. Also weight gain. My doctor agreed to allow me to stop the medication, but warned that the cancer could return. Not sure what I will do now, but my quality of life was severely impacted and I am 68 years old. I would like to enjoy whatever time I have left without severe pain.",1
"very bad joint swelling, hot flashes all the time, choppy sleep, weight gain, thinning skin and now hair. on this for over 4 years and will be stopping soon. my dr ""joked"" it was the drug that would turn me into a old fat man. I am not laughing anymore.",4
"I have been on little over a year. The pain is so bad in my elbows, hands, and where I would call my pelvis. All on the right side mostly. Itchy skin has been horrible on my back. Getting ready to contact Oncologist to see if there is something else I can take. Took about 6-8 months for side effects.",4
"I have just started taking anastrazole. I am having insomnia, some memory loss, ankles hurt and hot flashes. I don't know if it's effective yet so no comment on that. I was told that it will be good for me to take. Only time will tell. For sure I would rather take the pill than go experience more cancer.",3
"I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2014.Had surgery and radiation therapy. After the radiation therapy I started on anastrozole. In that time frame I have experienced muscle and severe joint pain. Also weakness in both hands. I am not able to do simple tasks that I normally took for granted, like gardening, which I love. My oncologist can only offer a prescription pain med. More side effects. Not going there. The pain makes me depressed and makes it almost impossible to exercise. I still work which is mainly a distraction from the pain. My husband asked what I wanted for Christmas and I told him he couldn't get me what I wanted. I just want one day without pain.",2
"Used for just over 5 years from age 55-60.  Did not have any obvious side effects.  Cancer recurred 8 months after finishing: very small lump.  Wish I had stayed on it.  Now taking Exemestane which is causing  me problems: nausea, muscle and joint aches.",3
"I had a lumpectomy in November 2013. I started taking this drug after my radiation. I do not experience any side effects on this drug, except hair thinning. Is there anything out there to counteract hair thinning?",5
I will reach the 5 year mark and over the last year I've had pain in both feet.  I hope to stop taking it soon.,5
"It has been a year. I have gained weight, my stomach is swollen and hard. I get chest pains, stabbing pain in the side of my head, back pain, can't move my left arm back, severe sweats, dizziness, cough, mouth sores, brittle nails, knee pain, stomach pains, itchy skin. The weight gain is disturbing. I always had a flat stomach, now I can't even hold it in because of it being hard. I eat all organic and even make my own bread and desserts, to avoid any chemicals. I don't go to sleep until 1 or 2 am, wake up at 6 am. Hard to get a good night of sleep. I have 4 more years of this pill. I told my oncologist that I will be 200 pounds, at the rate of weight gain. She said it would become stable. I hope so.",2
"I am writing for my mom (who is 83 years old) and was diagnosed w/stage 2 BC. She is also a type 2 diabetic. At first everything seemed to be okay. But within the last 3 months, her hands are numb, badly swollen feet/ankles. But the worse is the mood changes! forgetfulness, confusion, irritable, eyes hurting....",3
"Stage IIa breast cancer- tumor removed with clear margins Dec 2014. No lymph node involvement (2 removed). Limited chemo ( had to stop due to total intolerance, per oncologist recommendation). Completed radiation. Been on this med for 2 months. Nauseated constantly. Joint aches, hot flashes, numbness/tingling and swelling in right hand, sore breast, fatigued, and itchy. Skin is terribly dry ( much worse than during radiation) and psoriasis is worsening. I don't think I can last 5 years with this medication. ",2
I've been taking the drug for just over 4 months after a lumpectomy and radiation. Mild side effects until just recently and now I have experienced weight gain and joint pain. I don't see my oncologist for another 5 months but may want an earlier appointment if the pain gets worse.,4
"I have been on this medication for 3 months.The first few weeks seemed to be just a loss of appetite.Then, I am now experiencing insomnia with hot flashes.I had a double mastectomy but no chemo or radiation.Am hoping that these side effects will not get worse  are currently bearable.My Oncologist has been very supportive and explained how important it is to hang in there.I do suggest what helps me with the side effects is to manage stress with light excercise and a warm bath.",3
"Diagnosed end of 2008; early 2009 two lumpectomy surgeries, more than half of my lymph nodes removed, chemo, radiation and a 5 yr. treatment program of Anastrozole. Yes, I have aches/pains; yes, I experienced hair loss, weight gain, chronic cough, embarrassingly sweaty hot flashes, etc. like so many others have stated. But I'm glad I stuck with it and finally nearing the end. Was it worth it? YOU BET! For me, the side affects are a small price to pay for being cancer free! Hang in there-we are all strong cancer warriors!",5
About 6mos after I started this medication I started having severe joint pain especially in my knees. I scream in pain everytime I get up from my sofa. My knees almost feel like a pretzel that I can snap in half. I had to buy another kitchen set with high chairs so it would be easy for me to get up. I don't see how I can take this medicine for 5yrs.  My husband bought me a thread mill and we are hoping that will help with the pain.  I will let you know how that works out.,3
"I was diagnosed with with a well differentiated grade 1, stage 2, infiltrating mammary ductul carcinoma breast cancer. This meant it was a mixture of invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas and it was a fast-growing and aggressive Invasive cancer.  When starting this medication 4 years ago, I was told it would cause hot flashes, bone pain, etc.  I was also told if I could tolerate all the side effects, it would increase the chances of my cancer not coming back by 93%.  Even though I am experiencing many of the side effects others are talking about, I keep reminding myself of the 93% chance of the cancer not coming back and me being able to enjoy my family.  I find keeping up with an exercise program, walking at least 8,000 to 10,000 steps or more per day, eating as much organic meats and veggies, etc. along with a diet rich in protein and green veggies helps.  If we go out to eat and I eat chicken or beef, I have more hot flashes because this meet has more hormones than organic.  I try to eat more vegetables and fish when eating out and that helps.  Being active is just as important as your diet taking this med.  My side effects have been in stages.  I would have something for awhile and deal with it and in a few months it would stop then deal with something else and it would stop.  I have heard many reports on this on the news and in publications and it has saved many lives.  Stick with the medication, deal with the side effects, and have that 93% chance of seeing your grandchildren graduate college.  It's not easy and is a challenge but I know Jesus Christ went through more pain than we could ever imagine for us so I am doing this for my family.  Should it come back, they will have the peace of mind that I did everything I could to prevent it from returning.  My prayers are with all of you and ask that you remember me in your prayers also.",5
I've used this medication for about a year and the aches and pain in my joints can be unbearable. Very painful--especially if I do not get exercise.  Getting exercise does ease the stiffness of the joints.,4
I have been on this drug for 3.5 years.  Lumpectomy & radiation followed by Rx.  I've had no side affects to mention. This drug was recommended because of my age (66)and type of cancer.  Tamoxifin was not a choice for me.,4
I have been taking this medication since 11/13 and if any side effects they have been mild. I have notice hair thinning and a few aches and pains but most of that is probably due to my age as well (62). I hope this continues with no further side effects.,5
I've been on Anastrozole for just 2 months.  My joints are killing me and I can barely walk.  I go to the dr. next Thursday and I will share with her my pain.  It is debilitating to say the least.  ,3
My tumor shrank before my lumpmecotomy and I am still taking it.,5
I began this medication after Chemo. and seven weeks of radiation. My only side affect is not being able to lose weight. I had no problem before. Also having problems sleeping which I hadn't experienced before this drug. My doctor isn't sure it's the ill since it isn't every night.,4
"I've been taking this drug for six years with minimal side efects. Hot flashes several times a day but not severe, just a nuisance.  Some pain and stiffness in my hands but this could also be age-related.  Some weight gain.",5
Have only been on the medication for 7 weeks and have had few side effects.  I do have several hot flashes and sweating a day but not too bad so far.  Have had no pain or swelling at all but do feel more tired than normal in the evening.  Hope I tolerate it this well for the remainder of the 5 years.,3
"Couldn't take Tamoxifen, cause of side effects, so had surgery in order to take anastrozloe, side affects of this one is just as bad. Severe headaches,(daily) depression, insomnia, back pain, joint pain, hot flashes, sweating,lymphedema,fractures, cough. just awful, two drugs now, both a nightmare, cancer is easier to live with. Not fair. Not sure it's with it. These drugs.",1
"The joint pain is getting worse all the time.  I have only been on the med for 3 months.  Headaches, swelling of the hands, can not sleep, weakness, neck pain, confusion, muscle pain.  I do not think I can endure for 5 years.  The treatment is worse than the stage 1 cancer!  ",2
"I had a stage 1, invasive breast cancer that was treated by lumpectomy and 6 1/2 weeks radiation.  Doc prescribed a drug for 5 years.  I started on Femara, but night sweats and hot flashes were so severe, she switched me to this drug.  The first 10 months were fine, no side effects.  But, the past 2 months, the night sweats and hot flashes have returned with a vengeance.  Also experiencing a lot of muscle pain and overall tiredness.  She insists I continue taking the drug and said she could prescribe an anti-depressant which would cut down on the hot flashes and nights sweats, but I am not interested in taking yet another drug with more possible side effects.",4
"Hot flashes not fun! Trigger finger, hand pain, fatigue, and weight gain. Have been on it for 7 months. I will stay on it, hoping side effects diminish.",3
"I took this medication for six weeks and experienced too many side effects to include: rash similar to goose bumps throughout entire body, itchiness throughout entire body, hand and feet swelling, joint pain equating to major arthritis, back pain. leg cramps and muscle spasms. Hand numbness, skin discoloration, dryness of the mouth, etc. My Doctor has taken me off the medication.  Now after another six weeks, of attempting to rid the body of the medication, I am still experiencing a lot of the same symptoms even after visiting a dermatologist and an allergy doctor in hopes of ridding myself of some of the symptoms. My oncologist will try another pill in the future but I am very skeptical at the moment.      ",1
I have been on this medicine for 11 months now and my symptoms are hot flashes and sweating everyday.  When first starting did not have any joint pains but now have some joint pains.,3
Had severe reactions to Femara following left Breast Lumpectomy followed by Chemo & Radiotherapy. Then many side effects with change to Aromasin which made quality of life intolerable after 2 years on it. Yesterday Oncologist placed me on Anastrozole for 1 month trial & am now wondering if the same types of side effects will rear their ugly heads. Would it be better to take my chances & have a reasonable quality of life for time I've got left? Am 63 years old & had Lumpectomy in November 2011.,2
"I am taking this medication for 9 months, i feel a lot of pain specially in my upper body and my legs, i was fine like 3 months ago, but lately i feel that i can't walk for too long I start experiencing a lot of pain in my whole body from my head to toes and also chills in my body. I also notice that I can't do too much excersice because I feel pain in my whole body. I hope the pain is worth it for the cancer. ",4
"I had bilateral mastectomy, chemo and radiation and was advised to go on anastrazole for five years because I was Stage III, ER positive.  Before I took it I was getting over severe joint pain which seemed to be a delayed chemo effect.  On anastrazole for about 2 weeks I had itching that drove me crazy the whole time, seemed a little more anxious, edgy and had more sleep problems.  I was advised to stop it for a week when the skin around my eyes got so dry I had large skin patches flake off into my eyes and had pretty severe eye irritation.  I may go back on the drug but I would take it earlier in the day, and try preventing the skin dryness.  I was worried I would have joint pain but hadn't experienced that yet. (But only two weeks, so who knows).  I read that it is hard to monitor the estrogen level before and after taking this drug so I am going to ask my doctor if it is possible to go on a lower dose.

"severe memory loss, neuropathy, constant headache, weakness of legs, unable to climb stairs or go down stairs due to falling, unable to get up from toilet seat, had to change my residence from tri-level home to independent living retirement community with elevators and alarm system for falls. All these symptoms stopped or were markedly decreased within 6 weeks after I discontinued anastrazole. This whole experience was a nightmare for me, because my oncologist did not tell me to stop the medication or that symptoms were due to this drug. I found out for myself by reading about the drug adverse effects, which my oncologist should have known about and told me to discontinue anastrazole. I plan to follow up with him to inform him and ask for a referral to a more experienced oncologist.",4
have been on it for a little over two years. So far things are going very well.  ,4
"No way of telling if this drug is working.  Had knee pain, corrected by use of Osteo-bi-flex.  Now have trigger finger and muscle or tendon in left arm is so tight it burns when I stretch.  Who knows what else this drug is causing. Dr said symptoms which appear after taking for a month should be only symptoms but that's a lie. Seems new symptoms appear frequently.",2
"I have used this med for 3 1/2 years. I have had almost every side affect mentioned. I am happy that no further lumps have appeared in my breasts, but who knows about cancer in other parts of my body. I really feel this drug is going to help me live longer and won't stop. I don't want to take it more than 5 years no matter what. I have joint pain, rash, anxiety, hot flashes and slight mood swings. I find exercise and gardening help with all of these problems.  I have belly fat that I never had before and the Oncologist said that can be a side affect. I had trouble sleeping and now have to take a sleeping pill.  Never had to do that before. I now take an anti-depressant because I feel the pill has caused me to be depressed.  I am 73 and could be my age is contributing.  My IBS symptoms returned after many years but probiotics and Metamucil caps have helped that.",4

I have joint and muscle pain. I've been taking this drug for a year.  I been getting short term memory loss which I don't care for.  I have weight gain.  I just saw my oncologist and he is keeping me on this medication.,4
"Isn't it amazing that one drug can cause so many different symptoms! I have aching in my forearm, hand, shoulder, and neck.  The pain GENERALLY lasts for a short period of time, but it can be intense.  My oncologist wants me to try and stay on this med, as it is the best one for my condition.  As I have a 17-year-old that is going to college, I NEED to work through this. I am 70 and working. (I adopted two of my sister's grandchildren. That is why my boy is so young!)  I believe we can do this one way or another if we keep supporting each other. I ran into my radiation ""buddy"" yesterday, and it was wonderful to see us both without sunburn and blisters under our arms!  Yes, the weight gain is a pain, and the stiffness is not easy.  But, WE ARE STILL HERE! Hugs to all of you!!",3

"Shortly after starting this medicine I began having severe hot flashes, anxiety, depression, mood swings, insomnia, tiredness/fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, swelling of the legs, and joint/muscle pain.  I did not have chemo as it was determined not to be effective for my type of tumor.  I had lumpectomy and 3-4 lymph nodes removed followed by radiation. Doctor says it's more important I stay on this medicine for the 5 years.  My tumor was pretty large and the anastrozole did shrink my tumor prior to surgery so I was able to have the lumpectomy.",3

Most recently having muscle/joint aches in the evening after resting, waking too early in the a.m. - hot flashes - worse of all is the hair thinning !!

"Have been on Anastrozole for 17 months.Unsure if it works and unsure if side effects are from the medication or aging. Never had trouble with hands but middle finger got extremely stiff for about a month but now has subsided.

I had already gone through a horrible menopause in my late 40's and now I am suffering the same symptoms as before but can't have estrogen shots or patches to help.  I feel so awful.  I normally have so much energy I drive every one around me crazy.  Now I hide from everyone so I won't attack them.,4
"All cancer treatments are very rough on body and mind. After 2 years on anastrozole, my hair has thinned a lot and my libido is dead.  I am moderately uncomfortable due to hot flashes and weight gain.  Loss of interest in sex has caused sluggishness.  The high degree of memory loss is incredible and embarrassing!  On the other hand, to my knowledge, I am cancer-free.  I think the intended suppression of estrogen has been devastating for me in my relationships, my employment and with regard to my personal comfort throughout the day and night.  This, however is the best that western medicine has to offer. I always blame the cancer and not the pharmaceuticals or the doctors.",4

"I took this for almost 3 months at the same time I was doing radiation every week day. I though all along that the radiation was making me so sick. My radiologist insisted that it was not radiation. That I may have the flu. I told my oncologist that I did not want to do any chemo. He told me this was a hormone blocker and I should take it for 5 years. I did not realize that this pill was making me so sick until I researched it here on WebMD, I feel my oncologist deceived me and I have changed doctors. I had most all of the side effects listed for this drug and suffered needlessly.",1
"I have been taking Anastrozole generic 1 mg for a little over a month.Before taking the medication, I had pain in my hands and feet during the night and when I first get up out of bed. It feels like stiffness and tightness. I also had hot flashes that were severe. Since the medicine, I have had improvement in the hot flashes,(still there but not as bad) and the stiffness in the fingers and feet continues. I was premenopausal before the chemo.Now I am post menoposal.  I had TC. My doctor says the stiffness is from the chemo and should subside. The hot flashes he says will get better. They are running a bell curve cycle. I am hoping I am at the end of the curve. lol. I have had some stiffness in my hips,knees and shoulders and do not know if it is related to the chemo,the anastrozole,or just my muscle imbalance. I will go to a Sports Medicine Doctor tomorrow to see what kind of stretches and treatment they think will help. Overall, I will keep taking the drug and Praising God that he has brought me through !",5

"I've noticed a lot of postings saying, 'the oncologist insisted I had to take it.'  Then when all the side effects, severe joint pain, etc., come on, ocologists have said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They have, and the oncolgists then say that you don't need to take it.  Which is it - You need it or you don't need it?  Advising at consultation that you have an autoimmune disease that already causes severe joint pain in knees or already have osteoporosis should be enough for the oncologist to look at other options or forego the 5 or 10 year treatment and see how things go for a year or two.  How many of us are taking meds that we do not know how they will affect us long-term?",1
"Have taken it almost 3 years now and have experienced high blood pressure plus some of the bothersome side effects: dry mouth, vaginal dryness, chronic trouble sleeping, night sweats and joint pain.  However, since I'm 60 and post menopausal some of these symptoms could be associated with menopause.  In addition, I recently fell and broke my humerus and elbow.  I followed up with a bone density exam which shows osteoporosis in the hip area.  Will follow up with that this year.  I try not to worry too much and keep a positive attitude; things could be worse!",4
"My only problem is pain, sometimes severe, in my fingers and hands along with no longer being to open or close the hands fully.  Trigger finger starting on both hands. Loss of strength and mobility in both hands.",3
I have taken this for about 6 months and the tumor in my right breast has shrunk. I still will have to have surgery but feel blessed that my tumor is smaller.,5
After taking this medication for 6 weeks the pain in my feet and legs was unbearable so had to stop. Still waiting for it to clear system but I am diabetic and my blood sugar numbers are awful.  Is this also a side effect of this medication?  Can't for the life of me get it down.,1
I started taking this drug following chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer.Like the lady who posted on the 20th August 2012 I have had problems with my arms hands legs and feet. I find it difficult to walk now without pain. When I first stand it is difficult to get moving. The pain in my hands in particular keeps me awake at night. To say I have tingling and numbness is putting it mildly. It is very very painful.I cannot grip things and feel as though I have aged 20 years since I started taking this drug. I also have developed a rash on my arms and legs like goosepimples that dont go away. I have taken the drug for 2 months and my consultant has told me to stop taking it until I am reassessed.,3
"Following surgery and radiation treatments for early stage breast cancer, I began taking Anastrozole to prevent recurrence and metastisis.  I took this medication for 6 months before discontinuing as I had dramatic increases in blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Even with prescribed medication to combat the side effects, the continued use of this drug was impacting my overall health and my medical oncologist suggested I discontinue it's use.  I will now begin Tamoxifin.",3
I was diagnosed with stage one estrogen positive breast cancer in 2006. After a bilateral mastectomy I chose to not have any chemo and just take arimedex which was so expensive that I changed to anastrozole (1mg daily). I have a yearly Reclast infusion to protect my bones and only suffer from minimal side effects which are preferable to not taking the medication. I have spoken with my oncologist and we both agree that i can stay on the med. as long as I feel comfortable doing so. He has no problem with going past the five year mark with this med.,4
"I had stage 1 cancer in right breast, treated with lumpectomy, sentinal node biopsy, and radiation. Very low risk of recurrence. I had taken this drug for 4 months, and had finished my radiation, when I noticed pain and stiffness developing in my hands and elbows. I also have pain and stiffness in my leg joints which makes me walk like a drunk pirate when I first stand. I have trouble holding onto things, don't have the good grip I had before. I don't get any relief from pain medications. My oncologist said my blood tests are all good, but there are other options if I can't take anastrozole; but they aren't as well documented. She wanted me to add a joint supplement such as glucosamine; another pill!!! One of the other commentators mentioned that she tolerated the name brand version better; maybe I should switch to that? I sure don't feel like celebrating the end of my treatments like I thought I would!",3
"Started this drug in Dec 2011, by March I developed severe lower leg pain.  They thought it was a blood clot but in a week I could'nt walk and evern had a hard time holding a pencil.  Went to 4 doctors and was diagonised with Rhabdomyloysis. The fuild left all my muscles and my kidneys were failing. My muscles were so weak I fell and broke my ankle. 4 days after I quit this drug I felt better. Will never take it again.",1
"I've been taking the drug since Nov. 2011.  I was diagnosed with first stage breast cancer in both breasts between last week of Aug. and first week in Sept. of 2011. I was told that the left breast definitely had to be taken, but on the right I had an option, either a mastectomy or a lumpectomy.  I decided on a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction.  The biopsy showed all the cancer gone and none went to the limp nodes.  The last test show that i was at a very low risk of getting it again.  My oncologist put me on 1mg. of anastrozole, 1 tablet once a day for five years.  As far as side effects go I had several for at least the last twenty-five years, and I wasn't on any medication of any kind. No for me I do not see an increase of any of those side effects.  Th pre-existing side effects I have had past to present are hot flashes they started with menopause, after that I only get them at night.  Trouble sleeping, I always had that since I turned 50.  However, I have been retired for the last four years so I can sleep late, or take a nap in the afternoon. that helps. Thinning hair, again I've not noticed, since there's a gene in my family for thinning hair and since I long ago learned that we normally loose 100 hairs a day, that hasn't bothered me either.  It's better than having to go for chemo and loosing it altogether.  The last is weight gain.  Well I have always had a problem, however, I find drinking eight glasses of water a day plus other liquids, exercising and a good diet that eliminates all fatty foods and sweets does the trick for me.  All in all, I have no complaints about this drug.",5
"I have stage 4 bc, metasis to bone, have had radiation and chemo. This drug for 3 months. Suffer hot flashes, insomnia, extreme pain in spine, hips and legs and swollen feet. Just lost health insurance so must quit getting treatment.",4
"Have taken this for 2 months so far with side effects of Hot Flashes, insomnia, sweating at night, hip & back aches. Better than Chemo or having Cancer though.",3
"I have been on this drug since having ovaries removed following bilateral mastectomies, chemo therapy, radiation and 5 months of Treatment with Tamoxifen prior to removal of ovaries.  I have has severe depression, irritability, anxiety, joint pain and muscle pain and loss of appetite. I a quitting work to see if it will improve things.  If it doesn't I'm going off the drug because I have no quality of life on the drug.",4
The hot flashes are unbearable.,4
"Ts small and easy to take. side effects is rated for me from 1 to 10, I give it a 4.",4
I have severelly decreased appetite with this drug.    I am insulin dependent.  I use a pump.  With pump basal and bolus rates.    Decreased both since decreased appetite.  BUT--did not decrease my basal rate enough at night since not eating between 8P and 6A.  THEREFORE--SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA twice.    COULD HAVE DIED HAD HUSBAND NOT CAUGHT IT.  CLEARLY A DRUG INTERRACTION.  NO WARNING OF THIS>    ,5
"I experienced severe hot flashes, weight gain and hair loss. My oncologist said to take it anyway since it is the best drug for me. However, the hot flashes and weight gain are awful and I am now a borderline diabetic.",2
"This medication caused me to have heart problems,  It raises blood pressure and causes chest pain (heart attack)",1
"I am newly taking this drug and am having very bad body aches.  They are painful enough that I take ibuprofen every six hours to cope, even through the night. If I don't take the ibuprofen, I almost can't walk or get out of a chair.  I have yet to report this to my oncologist, but I will.  Other than that, I have no complaints.",4
"Had to go off Tamoxifin after 2 years, Stage 1 BC with low recurrance rate. I thought T would kill me with all fo the side effects such as thickening of the uterous. This med I have been on for 1 year 4 months and it is a God send for me. Still have no sex drive to speak of, but that is a small price to pay. Also, am 15-20 lbs heavier than before BC. That is something I work on everyday. I used to be a size 4 now an 8 I feel great and hopefully will still get great biyearly  checkup in June.",5
No side effects. My tumor has regressed!,5
"I've been on the drug for 1 year almost to the day and find it to be effective, so far, and the side effects I've experienced are insignificant enough to tolerate.",5
"Seem to have aa bunch of side effects which are troublesome but not totally unable to live with. Anxiety, depression come and go and sleeplessness is the worst.",3
No side effects to date.  Easy to take.,5
"I just started this med. I have several side affects, nausea, vominting, coughing, diarhea,hot flashes, sore throat. I have a question, can anyone tell me if this continues throughout med ( 5 yrs) or will it decrease soon?",2
"Early stage BC and the tumor was small. Biopsy Nov 2010, Lumpectomy Dec 2010. Radiation Feb-March 2011. Further test on the tumor showed I was at low risk of the cancer coming back. I had reservations about ANASTROZOLE because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. I started taking this the end of April 1011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects. Pain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away,) not sleeping well, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an unlikely but very serious side affect and to call doctor immediately. Oncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. She didn't put me on anything else. Anyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone and I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months. Good luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.",2
"Sept. 2007 I was diagnosed with estrogen postive breast cancer stage 1.  Opted for a mastectomy of the right breast. Took Arimidex for 2 years and as the generic brand anastrozole became available I was switched over.  I have some hair loss, aching feet, at times swelling in my throat, itching arms, aching joints and I'm noticably more tired.  I dislike the drug and disliked arimidex as well.  But don't have long to go to reach my 5 year mark.  However my doctor says they are going to recommend 10 years.  I say ""No thanks""  5 and done! ",3
"The drug causes trouble sleeping.  I have felt as though my throat wants to close up when sometimes swallowing, but didn't relate to this as a side effect until I read it.  My tongue will sometimes tingle or have a numbness.  My joints ache like crazy!  I was on amrimidex until the generic was birthed.  Then my insurance forced me to take the generic or pay a high price for arimidex.  The arimidex was not much better except I didn't have the throat and tongue issue.  My feet hurt all the time like I'm walking on broken bones.  I want to quit the drug, but I'm 1 1/2 years from completing 5 years as required.",3
back and hip pain,3
I was on this medication for one week and developed shingles in my right arm and hand. It started with pain in my back and shooting pain in my arm. Has anyone else developed shingles after taking this drug? I stopped taking it and am now dealing with the painful side effects of shingles.,1
"Be sure you check out all other possibilies before assuming you have side effects of this drug.  Since starting on this drug 4 months ago I have severe shoulder pain. Not fully accepting my oncologist's answer of a side effect, I saw a orthopaedic surgeon.  I have a bone spur in my left shoulder that is beginning to tear my shoulder muscle. Have a ""side effect?"" Get a 2nd opinion.   ",1
"I changed from tamoxifen to this after finding out chemo put me into early menopause.  It was HORRIBLE.  I had severe headaches all day, every day.  Add to that hip pain, diaherria, and non-stop hot flashes (2 or 3 every hour).  Doc put me back on tamoxifen and all the symptoms went away. ",3
"I was diagnosed 2009, bilateral mastectomy Jan. 2010.  I first took Femara but due to the extremely high cost of that drug, my oncologist prescribed Anastrozole 1 mg oral.  I have diarrhea daily, some nausea, weight gain, peripheral neuropathy of my hands and feet, joint pain, dizziness, blurry vision, extreme fatigue and now am experiencing nastiness -- much like when I would run out of my Premarin in past years.  I am hoping the side effects are warranted and my cancer does not return.",5
"Extreme diarhhea, stomach cramps, fatigue,sneezing, runny nose  during first few days of taking medication.  I would like to know since this is a week-end and I want to know if I may take an anti-diarhheal over the counter med to help with the diarhhea and will it agree with this medicine?  Urgent question!!!! ",2
"As I've only been taking this medication for 4 months, I do not know how effective it is.  Worst side-effects have been severe nausea and vomiting and it is for this reason that my oncologist has taken me off the med for 2 weeks.  I've also experienced increased pain in my back, legs, feet and hands (part of my left hand is numb; insomnia.  Unfortunately, it is rather normal for me to experience severe side effects and allergies to medications. I really hope that my Dr. can suggest another medication for me to try as I want to do everything I can to reduce recurrence of cancer!  I cannot imagine spending 5 years on anastrazole.  ",2
"doing well on this med, few side effects after 4 months.",5
"I've only used it since December 12, 2010.  The tumor has decreased in size.  No side affects.  This beats a mastectomy.",5
"Taking this medicine, I had the worst experiences!  I was tired, then I ended up in the emergency room with chest pain.  It showed up as acid reflux. As time went on my elbows ached and I felt awful.  This medication is disgusting and it took away four good months of my life.  Thank God, my Dr. allowed me to go back on Tamoxifin.",1
I have been taking this pill since 2003 and I have had very few sideeffects.  I had Breast Cancer Stage 2 spread to the lymph nodes.  I had a mastectomy and radiation and I feel this medicine has helped me survive these seven years.  I hope my experience with this med helps some other women. Muriel Sak,5
"I have been on this medication for 9 months and have had no adverse effects, except for weight gain. If it keep the cancer from spreading to the other breast or another part of my body, I feel the medication is working and won't worry about the weight gain. ",5
I know this is just the generic form of Arimidex but this is the second time since being diagnosed and treated in 'o6 that I'm taking it and noticing aches in joints and bottoms of my feet.  I haven't had any of that with Arimidex.  I'm willing to absorb any cost to go back to the Arimidex.,5
so far no side effects for breast cancer its working really  i would give it 5 stars ,5
"My 76 year old mom has been on Armidex for 3 months and is suffering from fatigue, muscle achs/joint pain, and hot flashes.  She had a total right mastectomy in January with clear lymphnodes.  She has insomnia and is in a great deal of discomfort because of the muscle aches, which occur in her back and into her shoulders and up her neck.  She appears to be worthless 1 hr after taking A.  She has tremendous faith in God and using that faith to know that she will be cured from this disease and will no longer have to take the Armidex.  Actually, at this point, she's seriously considering whether she'll stay on it or not.  Will visit oncologist in July to discuss.  God bless all of you women who are having to suffer this!",4
"I have been on Anastrozole Oral for almost one year.  I have suffered numbness in left hand, 'Power Surges'(hot flashes)too numerous to mention.  The worst is hip pain that started two months ago and just found out I have acute osteoporosis which last year I had the bone density of a 21 year old.  My oncologist has talked about a new drug that will replace this so-called preventable drug in June,2009.",1
"Arimidex is great, but it is VERY EXPENSIVE. It costs me over $100.00 a month and that is with insurance. I am considering ordering it from Canada. Thank GOD that my husband has a good job. But it's still a big expense that I feel bad about every month. Why can't we get a cheaper version? I will need to take it another couple of years..",5
"Not good. I think the dosage is too high for women under 180 pounds. The dosage is the same for someone 140 pounds,as someone who is 240 pounds.That's crazy. I am having really bad side effects. My joints ache,especially my legs ,the bottoms of my feet ache, now I can not use my thumbs at all(trigger finger), my blood pressure has become very high, i have to take this pill at night because it knocks me out for three or four hours(I don't respond to noise or light,i think this is dangerous),my thumb now pops out of place and i have to pop it back into place,which is very painful.My liver and kidneys are now being affected.So ,I don't know if I want to keep taking this drug or not.I really wonder just how safe it is.The high blood pressure is making me flush bright red and I feel really tired and depressed.",2
"Diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer,lumpectomy, sentinel nodes removed and biopsied and were clear. I declined radiation. I started this med almost 3 years ago, I have experienced an all over degeneration in my health. I have sharp pains in my head at times, when I get out of bed in the morning, I sometimes can't walk, my back is so sore.  I have rashes all over my body that are itchy. I have tried every kind of anti itch cream and nothing helps.  I have two trigger fingers.  My IBS returned and I hadn't had a problem in years. My knees are sore and my memory has declined.  While some things may be caused by age, it is difficult to believe the severity of these symptoms is all due to aging.",1
I have a bit of nausea but no vomiting. Also gave me headaches. I feel much better with this med than during my last chemo where I wasn't given this med.,4
"Couldn't stop the hiccups which occured for hours and several days. Couldn""t talk without hiccuping. Would even keep me up at night. Stomach and whole body so sore from them that if I recd relief from the nausea I didn't know it.",2
"I had taken this medicine for about 5 years. So far I haen't had any problems with it. There'll be a few times that I did not need the shot, because the numbers were too close to 12",4
"on day of inj. i feel rather sleepy, is this a side effect?",5
This Medication works okay. The guidelines for this has been changing like crazy this last year for a max hemoglobin of 14 down to 12. I would rather use EPO. ,4
I have never been able to keep the count to 12,3
MY AUNT HAS BEEN ON THIS MEDICATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR CHRONIC ANEMIA DUE TO IMPARIED KIDNEY FUNCTION AND HAS DONE VERY WELL WITH IT. -0- SIDE EFFECTS.,5
It's very hard to administer this injection to my 6 yr.old son,3
"Lost R kidney to CA - few years later - depressed by Constant fatigue - poor appetite - nephrologist put me on Aransep shots as lack of R blood cells - HGB - below between 10 &  11 After 1 yr & 1/2  stabilized in the 12s  Fantastic difference in my total wellbeing.  Depression when lower than 12 is, very depressing! (Pun)",5
My husband has Myelofibrosis. It is a rare kind of leukemia. He is given this to help with the cancer anemia. It has helped his HGB stay above the level of transfusion. Transfusions are part of this cancer's progression.,5
"Father (88 yrs old) has aplastic anemia. Has been on aranesp a few months now.  Started at 60mcg...now up to 200mcg twice a month.  Working well keeping up the red blood cell count.  Before, he needed transfusion every six weeks... now it's already been almost 20 weeks since the last transfusion.",4
"Is this stuff really made from killed e-coli virus and grown in Chinese hamster ovaries?  Based on FDA warning and origin, this drug was refused by patient.",1
"Very effective,great feeling of well being lots of energy  ,",5
"Shots given regularly at first, now intermittently. Feel out of it the first couple days following, but then better.",5
I feel so much better a few days after my shot. I can tell when i need one because I get very tired .,5
Just had shot 3 of 4.  so far so good. ,4
"I have my blood drawn every two weeks with a standing order.  My doctor keeps me between 11 and 12 g/dl.  Currently I am taking 40 mcl (?)every 16 to 28 days injections. After my blood is drawn it is reviewed at the doctor's office and if it falls below, like 11.1, I receive a telephone call to come in for the shot.",4
"I have just received this shot Friday, & already hate it! I was good Friday, then on Saturday I woke up wit a massive migraine that I still have & it's now Sunday. I've taking migraine meds & nothing seems to work. I'm still very tired. I need to take this or since my iron is so low I would need a blood transfusion & I'm not doing that! This shot was my only choice. Luckily, I only need it every 2 weeks. ",1
" I HAD ONE SHOT OF THIS MED. AND I FEEL TERRIBLE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE HAD THE FLU FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS. SHOULD RETURN TO TAKING THE EPOGEM THAT I HAVE TAKEN FOR MORE THAN 5 YEARS WITH OUT ANY PROBLEMS? THANK YOU, MARIE",1
New to this drug,3
I think I feel a little better.,4
"Three years bi-weekly injections have NOT improved WBC, RBC or hemoglobin.  I intend to discontinue injections.  Family physician says if I do not see improvement, discontine.  Very expensive snake oil.  Thank you.  R. Smith",1
"After 6 bi-weekly injections due to kidney problems, doctor canceled the injections and my red blood count has dropped 12 points during the next 2 weeks ",5
"I have MDS.  I take the injections every 2 weeks. The dosage is 200mcg.  It elevates my blood count and I feel so much better for several days. I have more energy. I wish that I could monitor my blood count in the same way that a diabetic is able to do at home. I don't think I would be able to keep working if I did not have the Aranesp because I get so tired without it. I do have some aching in my bones for a day or two after each dose, but it is minor compared to the problem of fatigue.",4
unclealmale74 been using this drug for a couple of years now seems to be working ok. have the injection every week 200mcg.,4
"I actually just had my first shot a week ago and am supposed to have another in 2 weeks; however, I feel so doggone tired, I may look for something alternative and mention to my doctor I'd rather not take it again.  My hemoglobin has pretty much been a consistent issue even before chemo, so I'm thinking it's probably because of recent surgery & radiation that it fell lower.  I keep praying that God will give me strength!  I wish the same for you all.",1
just wondering if this drug will cause orange color in bowels,3
weekly injections at the hemotology and oncology clinic to keep my red blood cell production up.,4
seem to have more energy,4
"My Mom was on this medication for a little over a year for MDS. It worked first six months but in the last six to eight, it didn't have any effect on her Hgb count even tho they kept raising the doses. Shortly after a 500 dose she died within 3 days. Hard to say if the injection was the fault or not as Mom had other health problems also.",2
shots barely maintain red cell levels from one session to the next. using to defer transfusions as long as possible.  currently (7) weeks since last trans.,3
no opinion yet,3
"I get the injections once a month as I have CML. I stayed tired, lack of energy, and my red cells aren't going up. When I was given 3 pints of blood, I felt great, energetic, didn't feel tired after doing a single task. I didn't need to sit and rest after just doing dishes. With the injections given to me at my oncologists office, I find I am more tired each day, no strength, totally drained. If busy on one day, the next I end up sleeping most of the day. I feel the injection isn't helping me, and the fact that I was anemic prior to being put on chemo pills for my leukemia, that I have Conjestive heart failure and retaining of fluids, that it's not treating the anemia or making the red cells increase. Mine stay below normal on a constant basis. ",1
too many of the side effects.  Mucle cramps and nausea.  ,3
My father has been taking this medical since March of this year and we have seen that his red blood count has come up a little. He feels a little better not as sleepy,3
"The biggest problem I am having is severe bone and joint pain for up to a week after having the medicine. I have had 5 injections to date and it has not diminished at all. It very possibly is getting worse pain wise but slightly shorter duration. I am unsure at this time as to it's effectiveness. I am still having to have red blood cell transfusions. The last was a little longer between transfusions. The bone marrow biopsy showed that it is not producing enough red cells and those produced are not healthy. They have about half the lifespan as normal cells. The drug is designed to help my body produce more and healthier cells. So far, and it may be too soon to tell, it has limited results. The doctors are hopeful. At this time, there are at least six days every two weeks that I declare I will not have another shot! I may request that we rely on transfusions only, although I understand there drawbacks to that approach.",3
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,3
I prefer using the Sureclick as opposed to using the vile. I do not have to measure it out in a syringe myself since I do my injectons at home myself.,5
"we had side effects from this drug . lower back pain,rib cage pain and an overall feeling of letherge ",5
The injection hurts as it is like a bee sting ,5
"Monthly injection... after a year bone mass about same so has reduced that degeneration. Leg pain reduced, back pain no more. Do not seem to have related side effects. Very important to have nutritional food... go to Chinese buffet from fish, chicken, veg, to fruit and hot tea. Appetite has come back.",4
As far as i know this drug don't work for me ,1
"I have aredia infusions to stop bone loss from taking Arimidex for Breast Cancer. I feel like I have the flu for 3 or 4 days,but I have noticed it really helps with the bone pain.",5
"I have taken this drug approximately every 4 weeks since being dxd with bone mets 4 years ago. I usually get mild, flu-like sxs for a few days after, but it is well worth taking if it protects my bones!",4
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE HAD IS THAT FOLLOWING DENTAL WORK I WAS DX WITH ONJ,3
"I've only had this treatment twice now, but both times I've experienced pretty much all of the side effects listed, along with inflammation/pain/infection to the I.V. site.  My doctor put me on Cipro to combat that and it worked.  My doctor will be giving me Benadryl before my giving me the Aredia next time to see if that rids the infection from happening.  Overall, it's something I can handle and deal with.",3
"SIDE EFFECTS WERE: FEVER TO 101 X 2 DAYS, NAUSEA & VOMITING, RIGORS, CHILLS, PARESTHESIAS, MALAISE X 2 MORE DAYS.",3
It has improved my bone density with no known side effects,5
My son is 5 years old he has osteoingenesis imperfecta and this was our first ever infusion he did really well the first day he slept though it but when we got home he had a mild fever. he also would say his back and legs were hurting. th second day was a little worse he was not having it he was done and simply did not want to be messed with.After the second infusion we went home and he had a fever and flu like symptoms doc said it was normal but he is still c/o pain and now has orange in color bowels . im not really sure what to do. ,4
"I have just started the treatment with pamidronate. I had very very severe side effects: very high fever, shortness of breath, pain, pain and then some more pain. I ended up in the hospital with high fever. I shall never take it again",4
each time I have had the iv I get diariea and this time I hve had it  for 4 days what can I do to stop this side effect,5
my doctor premedicates me with solumedrol tagamet iv tylenol and benedryl.  after infusion i am very hot all over body and use ice packs to cool off.  hot flashes last 3 to 4 days have been getting monthly for 8 years for osteoporosis due to prednisone use for sarcoidosis.  Had rib fractures knee fractures and spinal fractures from prednisone  pamidronate 90 mg monthly iv over 4 hours infusion.  ,5
"Along with daily Femara since Dec. 2010, I have been given Aredia {via port infusion]every 4 weeks since Jan. 2011 after being diagnosed with breast cancer and bone mets 5 mos ago. I have experienced no addit'l pain, infections, or problems whatsoever with Aredia. Each month, I am gaining more and more strength, adding weight, which my onocologist attributes to the Femara, not the Aredia. And, since I have Stage IV cancer, the Aredia and Femara are basically slowing the cancer and making me feel better. My oncologist says invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is still life-threatening, and it's going to kill me in 2-3 years...",5
"had pamidronate for ten years, to be told I dont have pagets? What is the long term damage of this treatment or a complaint I dont have",5
"Coming up on my 5th monthly treatment, 90 mg, by IV over 2 hours. I seem to be tolerating well, though I feel a bit run down and not as mentally sharp as I expect myself to be.

I have been receiving Pamidronate by IV since Aug. '05 along with Femera to treat breast cancer bone metastases with wonderful results. It appears I've been cancer free for a year now! The only reason I didn't give full marks was because I now have poor veins making it difficult to give me an IV. Don't know if that is related to the Pamidronate or not. ,5
I was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000.  Earlier this year (2008)I found out it spread to my liver and my spine (small tumors).  I am currently taking Taxotere (chemo) and Pamidronate.  The last PET scan I had showed no signs of cancer! I had a port installed in my chest area to make it easier for me to get the treatments and since Pamidronate is a long term option for me at this time.  Side affects:  I do have some back aches and I do get light headed at times.,5
"I've been receiving monthly bone infusions for almost a year now due to breast cancer that has spread to the bones. I decided to skip one month and was in quite a bit more pain than ever before. So, obviously, I am back to taking on 4-week intervals.",5
I have been receiving PADRIMONATE IV infusions since 2003 for polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.  Initially I was on a quarterly schedule.  My bone density has improved tremendously over time and now I am on an annual dosage.  I have had only one fracture since starting Pamidronate and my femur healed perfectly.  I feel very fortunate and thank my medical team for everything.,5
"I found this medication to be a total waist of time and money.  I found that the side effects if you have Osteogenesis Imperfecta is very bad.  This medication/treatment prevents healing of the bones and while it does make you break less, when you do break it gets worse.  I would recommend that everyone with OI on this medication/treatment to stop NOW before its to late.",1
Increased bone pain with fracture of spine after 6month p use!,2
"Ductal carsinoma in situ.  Biopsy dislodge duct wall.  Caught by sentinel lymph nodes.  Non in later layers. 33 radiation sessions. Took Arimidex for three years with 3 clean mammograms.  Stopped taking as I could hardly walk (pain in joints, muscles, and bones), had no joy (depression?), cholesterol increased. glucose increased, and extreme fatigue. I felt as those I was 90 years old.  So I decided to stop taking the Arimidex.  Amazingly, within days everything went back to normal.  I could walk without pain and I felt FREE!!!  I will keep getting my mammograms, and am awaiting my bone density test to see if any permanent damage was done as I had good bones.  I believe they took the cancer out and I am cancer free.  But, I could not live my life with the pain and anguish of Arimidex.  ",3
I had a lumpectomy and radiation at the beginning of 2017. I began taking Anastrozole (1 mg) (generic brand of Anastronat) from bonhoa.com in March of 2017. I was concerned because of all the reviews I have read about the side effects. I have to let everyone know that there is hope that you may not experience these effects. I have been taking it daily since then and have had NO side effects (praise the Lord) I thought there would be fatique or joint pain- but so far in the 9 months. I have had no bad side effects. I hope you will have the same experience that I have had.,5
"I have been on Arimidex for 5 years, buy the cheap generic one from bonhoa.com more than 1 years. No pain or problems, and with a vitamin D supplement, I have been feeling great! Didn't have any problems.",5

"Had stage 1 breast cancer and is HER2 Positive.  I started this drug July 2015; and I have had the worst joint and muscle pains.  My knees is where the worst of the pain is.  I also have problems with my hands and opening and closing them on a daily basis.  I also developed a rash on my lower leg that happened after starting this medication.  This may be too much information, but it is a task for me to sit on the toilet without my knees being in constant pain with I try to get up.  I have expressed joint pain to my oncologist, only to be ignored.  I have an appointment in about 2 weeks; and after reading all of these statements that have confirmed what I been experiencing for the last year, I will advocate better for myself.  I am so grateful for all of you women and your stories.  I have already gone through the unthinkable with having Breast Cancer; and I don't want to have this kind of pain for the next 4 years.  My quality of life is at 60% on this drug; and I want to have a better quality of life. ",3
"Had dbl mastectomy last October from Stage 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Lymph nodes clear. Surgeon started me on Anastrozole one month prior to that.  No chemo or radiation needed. Surgeon ordered bone density test for baseline purposes and said I should have it done every year. I've now been on the drug for almost 10 months.  Have a few ""power surges"" every day but they are not intense.  Started losing hair early last year, before diagnosis so I don't know that I can blame this drug for that issue.  Two months ago, I developed symptoms similar to carpal tunnel or tendonitis.  Went to orthopedic doctor and he gave me a brace an cortisone shot, which didn't help.  Don't know if hand problem is due to this drug or not but it is listed as a side effect. Have noticed increased hip joint pain. My sleeping problems are due to discomfort from my implants because when I change positions in bed, I can go back to sleep.  I think I'm more fortunate than most of the ladies in these reviews BUT I've only been on the drug for about 10 months.    ",4
"Stage 1 breast cancer, no lymph node involvement, lumpectomy. Four weeks of radiation. One month off to heal, then began Arimidex. Four months so far.  I was already taking two meds for RA, so the oncologist said that should help with any joint pain (none noticed!). Already on a med for osteopenia, so that should help with any bone thinning. My hairdresser recommended using Bosley hair shampoo and conditioner to help with hair thinning. It doesn't regrow hair, but it keeps hair from falling out. It has worked amazingly as one RA drug had already begun hair thinning which has now stopped. New hair re-growing since using it. Two side effects of Arimidex noted: 1) tingling/mild numbness in fingers and toes, off-and-on, and 2) weight loss -- so far about 2 lbs. per month. I can certainly live with that. Oncologist thinks that will even out soon. Overall, very happy with lack of side effects! ",5
"I have been taking Arimidex generic for 4 years and 10 months. I had stage 1,estrogen receptive, clean lymph nodes and had radiation. I have experienced roaming joint pain, hair thinning, fatigue, no libido, memory loss, severe hot flashes, trouble staying hydrated, and depression and weight gain. I tried effexor and I did sleep better, but didn't like how it made me feel. It was VERY DIFFICULT getting off this drug! Dr wants me to continue 5 more years, surgeon says stop NOW ! Breast cancer took my mom 26 years ago, but no BRACA Genes! Decision time settle for a reduced quality of like and live in fear of making the wrong choice or suck it up - Take the Effexor, Diet More, Pray More, Keep working out very often, and be with my loved ones ! ",5
"Don't take this drug!  Bad side effects, and some of them last years after taking the drug!  I took it in 2008 and most of the side effects went away, but the arthritis is still there.  You can't put back cartilage when it is gone.  Do not take this, please!",3
"this medication has caused significant hair loss, took it for five years, hair never came back. not bald, just horribly thin. arthrites, simply unbelievable. i am alive, its been 9 years and i am happy for that, would love more hair, less pain, however i am very happy to be alive and it probably is the reason. hard choices.",3
"I had lumpectomy and all margins came back clear. That was followed by 20 radiation treatments. I have only been on this drug for 3 months. So far I feel lucky that I have not experienced the severe reactions that many of you have described above. My major concern and one that I don't see anyone has listed, is a rash on my thighs and knees. It's worse at night when trying to sleep. I could scratch all night. I know it seems silly to complain, but I'm finding myself in the tub some nights at 3 am. Has anyone else experienced this?",4
"In 2013 I had mastectomy, chemo & radiation then took tamoxifen for a year until I couldn't tolerate the leg cramps & blood clots during reconstruction surgery caused by tamoxifen. Got switched to arimidex in December 2014 and within a couple of months my jaw started popping & I had to push it with my hand to be able to chew my food. At the same time, my left thumb started popping until it eventually swelled up & couldn't bend. After about 3 months, my left thumb improved then my right thumb started popping & froze. After about a year, those symptoms slowly went away and then my hip flexor suddenly became the painful body part. It's been 1  1/2 years and all of those painful symptoms have faded away (knock on wood). The only side effect that hasn't gone away is the 30 pounds I gained. Now I feel good enough to go Latin dancing for several hours twice a week (before arimidex I had lost 30 pounds after intense salsa dancing for 3 months), I also jog 30 minutes a day, and go to the gym 2x a week, eat half of what I used to, and still can't lose ANY of the 30 pounds. My blood pressure doesn't want to go down so I will have to add another blood pressure medication to the one I started taking 3 months ago.  My oncologist told me that none of these symptoms are side effects from arimidex. She is lying to my face. I've spoken to other women who've had the same symptoms from arimidex.  Now my onc says instead of taking it for 5 years, new studies say chance of non-recurrence is much better if I take it for 10 years. Not sure what I'll do. I'd rather take something natural.",5
"Began taking Megace 8 years ago to prevent recurrence of Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma. Experienced quick 25 lb weight gain, night sweats and irritability, but maybe some symptoms result of total hysterectomy (instant menopause). Switched to Arimidex and lost 20 of the 25 lbs fairly quickly. Have not had recurrence of disease or any other noticeable side effects. ",5
"I started on ARIMIDEX for invasive lobular Ca: node neg.  I had hot flashes. Constipation, joint pain, a lot of fatigue, stomach burning, heartburn, headaches.

"Do any of you know of a practitioner in the Los Angeles area I could go to to receive guidance on alternative therapies.  I was diagnosed with Bilateral DCIS  in 4/2016 and opted for a double mastectomy (performed 6/8/16) grateful for the early diagnosis and thinking it was over.  Unfortunately pathology after mastectomy revealed invasive DC on one side Stage 1, which landed me in Med Oncologist office.  He has prescribed Arimidex which i began only last week (thus my ratings above are unknown) but reading all of your posts I am mortified and don't want to risk such a diminished quality of life.  I approached my doctor about the many natural alternatives I've read about to get guidance and his response was to suggest I switch to tamoxifen, but as to the natural alternatives he wrote ""The alternative medications and lifestyle modification that you list are very interesting and provocative but I am unable to give you any clarity on their benefit as none of them have been studied scientifically.""  Help",1
"I have joint and body pain all over from my ankles to my head. I think my hands and fingers are the worst but then I try to bend down. My knees, calves, elbows...like I said all over. Oh and hair thinning. Not sure if I can keep going. Please help!",3
"My experience with this drug is difficult to determine.  After a lumpectomy and radiation for a stage 1-B DCIS I was put on this drug.  I had heard about the hot flashes and joint pain, but I had already been experiencing those problems after going off Prem-Pro.  It has been 18 months since I started this drug. I take Effexor for severe hot flashes. The hot flashes were 20x a day, now down to about 8x daily and less intense, or at least I perceive them being as being less intense! Also I have trouble with tendonitis in my wrist and heel. The Cancer doctor said, ""MY BAD"", meaning it was probably caused by the Arimidex. I gained 30 pounds back after loosing 25 before breast surgery.  Now I am on Celebrex to alleviate the joint pain, and it does work, but I feel like I am taking too many drugs to know what is causing what.  ",2
"Have been taking Arimidex for 6 1/2 months and stopped takin it 1 week ago.  The joint and bone pain was agonizing and I would give the pain a 10 at the least.  I could not write, or use my hands after just a month of use and it continued to become debilitating and all I could think about.  Going to try Aromasin in a few weeks to see if that works better. ",3
"I guess the it is effective as my cancer has not returned. Ease of use-easy to swallow. Satisfaction- Terrible. I have been on this medication for 2 years and I am thinking of quitting. I have constant bone and joint pain. Everything I eat makes me sick. Diarrhea is awful. I can't sleep through the night even with pain medication for the joint pain. I have fatigue. I had hair loss. My cholesterol, which has always been 145 is over 200. I was shocked. My blood pressure goes up and down. My quality of life sucks. ",5
I have all of the side effects of this medication. I am almost 2 years into the treatment. But everyday is a struggle. I have severe bone and joint pain. I have stomach and digestive issues. My hair has thinned. The hot flashes have stopped that goodness. I assume it is working but who knows. It is a daily decision whether to take it today. I do skip it on purpose when my gut keeps me home. Wicked stuff this is.,4
"I started taking Arimidex in October 2015, after 4 months I have horrible joint and muscle pain, overall body pain, weakness in my knees, pain moving my fingers, elbows, knees, and hips.  Unsure if it is worth all of this.",3
"I have only been on this drug 2 months, starting to experience joint pain, not sure if it's drug only or combination of that,working in a restaurant, and/or drinking alcohol. No one has given any answers or experience of drinking with this drug. If anyone has answers please do tell.",3
At first for about a month or less I had bone discomfort at night.  This went away fairly soon.  No more discomfort except lately I notice indigestion when I lie down to sleep if I get up and walk around it goes away with burping.  I am going to stop taking the arimidex at night and I think that will end this problem.  All in all it has not been a bad experience. I have had difficulty sleeping but maybe it is caused by taking arimidex at bed time.  I will take  it in the morning and I think this will make a big difference.,5
"STARTED ARIMIDEX AUG 2014. FEB/MAR TO OCT 2015 SEVERE FATIGUE, MUSCLE WEAKNESS.SWELLING OF KNEES AND ANKLES AND FEET. FIRST WEEK OF OCT HAD SEVERE BONE PAIN IN FINGERS AND TOES. OCT 10 HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WALKING. WOKE UP  NEXT DAY WITH NUMB FINGERS AND HANDS, FEET AND TOES. PAIN AND PINS AND NEEDLES IN ALL 4 EXTREMITIES. SEVERE JOINT PAIN AND I COULD NOT WALK OR USE MY HANDS. I COULD NOT WRITE.  I STOPPED THE DRUG 2 1/2 WEEKS NOW. HANDWRITING HAS IMPROVED, I STILL HAVE NUMBNESS AND STILL NEED A TRANSPORT CHAIR. ALL TEST DONE HAVE COME BACK NEGATIVE. I AM CONVINCED IT IS THE DRUG.  ",1
"First 2-4 months no problem.  Gradually kept getting alot of side effects.  Have joint pain which progressed to pain all thu body, bone scan shows widespread degenerative disease.  Hot flashes were the worse and as I continued on the medicine they got so bad and started being accompanied with bouts of dizziness, once when driving.  Hot flash so intense gave me a very ill feeling in my body when it was happening and the longer I took the more sever they became.  Did not want to eat because just felt so bad.  Lost weight.  For the past 12 months it these side effects increased in intensity.  Would take pain pills on some days.  Started getting depression because felt so bad.  I quite taking them after 15 months (off now for 2 months).  I am gradually starting to feel better but I am afraid my bones in back may have been effected.  They are starting to crack sound when I turn or move.  Almost makes me feel like that are thining and I am worried now the wrong move can snap a bone in my back.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DRUG.  In spite of all this it only increases your chance of cancer not coming back by 2%.  The damage that this drug has caused is worse than the 1 stage of DCIS cancer I had.  Drug companies have got to make money even if it is at the cost of patients lives.  I am looking into more natural things I can do with eating better, exercising and taking vitamins if I need them.  My dr. even said that 2% means cancer may not come back in that breast but can come back somerwhere else even if you are on the med.  I choose quality over quanity. ",1
"I HAD DCIS FIRST, TOOK TAMOXIFEN, STOPPED AFTER 1&1/2 YRS. 5YRS. LATER CANCER GAME BACK. NOW ON ARIMIDEX. I CAN TAKE THIS. JOINT PAIN, I TAKE FISH OIL AT NIGHT AND Q-10 IN THE MORNING. IT WORKS.. I ALSO HAD DOUBLE MASS. AND RECONSTRUCTION DONE....",5
I've only been on this drug for 6 months and I stopped it 2 weeks ago I cannot bear the joint and bone pain that it has caused. With the percentage  under 5% that I'll have a reoccurrence of cancer by continuing this drug for the next four and a half years it's not worth it.  I will try tamoxifen but if it also causes serious side effects that are debilitating I will discontinue all hormone blocking drugs and just take my chances it is what it is,1
"After being on Arimidex for almost a year, I had such tremendous breast pain following lumpectomy (both breasts) and lymph node (1) removal on each side, that I was advised to go off for a month, and the pain should go away.  and it did!!!!  BUT!  now the nervousness, dizziness, sleeplessness have emerged.. I hate this feeling every single day and hope that with Stage 1 HER2negative, being told that I am lucky and this surgery/radiation should be the cure..  I am hoping that when I see the Dr in two months, I can go off of this drug..  I am a wreck and it's hard to cope with this drowsy, lethargic, jittery daily feeling, and now see where my hair thinning is attributable as well as weight gain ...  I see that others have this as well..  While the alternative is disastrous, living like this daily for the next 4 more years is not pleasant..  If I did not have to work, I think coping might be easier?  I'm not sure, but sitting at my desk, almost falling asleep by mid day is terrible..   I guess there is no alternative to this drug, but damn!! I will find out..",3
I have been on this for about 6 months after having taken tamoxefen for 5 years and my cancer came back.  At first the only side effect I had was the hot flashes.  But I got the generic this time and find that the fatigue and sore joints are a huge issue.  Plan to bring this up at my next appointment. ,3
The drug has quickly shrink my neurotic mass and tumor in breast,5
"Stage 1 breast cancer and 1 week of radiation.  After 17 months on the drug, my lipids are now very high, which I now learned is another side effect.  I've never had a cholesterol problem.  Must choose to discontinue or have heart problems.",2
"Just finishing 5 miserable years on this drug, for stage 1 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, a tiny tumor.  Seems like overkill, trying to smash a fly with a sledgehammer.  I doubt I even needed to be on this horrible drug, which caused the following side effects: very stiff and painful joints - especially in the hands and feet, hot flashes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, heart irregularities (had to be put on heart med to control), tired most days, minimal hair loss.  I feel 20 years older than I am, like a shriveled up old lady. Limping around.  I get off this drug in a month and will be celebrating my 60th birthday - hoping to feel younger instead of older.   If doctors had to experience these side effects, they might prescribe this medication less often.  I don't think it was worth going through 5 years of awful quality of life to lower my chance of a recurrence by just a few percentage points.  It hardly seems worth it, and I regret doing it. It's amazing how most doctors underestimate how awful this drug can be - my gynecologist implied I was being a big baby for complaining about it.  I will not be going back to her again.",1
Being relatively new to the med (< 6 months) I can say that the side affects far outweigh the outcome (hopefully).  A question that I have not been to get a definitive answer to is:  are the weight gain sleeplessness temporary?,4
"firstly I cannot say anything yet about the effectiveness of the drug as I have only been on it for a short time, so I put what I hope it will be. I was diagnosed in October 2014 with breast cancer had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal. The cancer had not spread to the nodes, thank god. I had radiotherapy for a month and will be having my final session in two days.I started the drug about 3 months ago. I have had no side effects like the ones that most of you have had. I do have slight pain in the hip area and lower left side. I attended my doctor who said it was a kidney infection, but the pain is still there. I don't know if it has anything got to do with the Arimidex. Apart from that I have no problems as yet with it. I'm so sorry to hear from all of you the pain that you are in, its terrible to go on suffering after all you have gone through with the cancer itself. We will all survive this, you have to have hope ladies, and hopefully another drug can be found that will bring us all back to the health we had before the cancer. Keep your chin up ladies and love life.",5
"I have been taking arimidex for the last four years and have one more year to go (I hope) I have experienced hot flashes, tiredness, and thinning hair.  My dexa scans are fine and I have not had any arthritic or increased joint pain...my weight remained stable, but I am losing weight now or other reasons.  After reading really bad reviews on this drug, I was reluctant to take it, but for ME, it has worked although I used to have really long hair and had to cut it because my hair thinned out so badly.  Hey!  I am still here to tell the tale, so I won't complain too much...but hot flashes are terrible and I have tried everything I can, soooo I am just one hot mama! ugh!",5
"I love the term Arimi-death!  That explains my whole situation. Horrible joint pain especially in my wrist, hands and fingers, insomnia, hot flashes and burning skin. I have turned into a 100 year old female within the last year and a half. I think the doctors that prescribe this beast should have to take it themselves. Maybe they would get clue on how terrible we feel.   ",3

But I feel blessed that this drug has the opportunity to help me as the alternative scares the heck out of me.  ",5
"I already had bone on bone Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Carpal tunnel, Spine Stenosis, plus too many more to write. I hate this pill, my breast cancer was stage 1, done went though menopause. My Rheumatologist said she has done all she can for me. I can hardly use my hands. The Neuropathy in my feet is worst, every thing is worst. I have been on this for over a year, I talked to the cancer Doctor about all the pain, he said we will see where you are in 5 yrs. I can NOT take this that long. I was taking this pain pill which helped, but it got to where  it only lasted for 4 hours. Now don't even have that. I have thought of just going to sleep and not waking up. I don't know how much longer I can take this pain 24/7.....",1
"I'm so happy to have found this site. It is important to realize I am one among many with severe side effects from Arimidex and not just  an overreacting patient!I was diagnosed with stage 1 aggressive ductal cancer. My treatment regime included a lumpectomy,chemotherapy,36 radiation treatments,18 Herceptin treatments and 5 years of Arimidex. I've completed 23 months of Arimidex with the following side effects;anxiety,sleeplessness,low libidity,short term memory loss,difficulty finding words, weight gain,carpal tunnel (requiring surgery), a rotator cuff injury,due to inflamation and severe roaming joint pain to every joint in my body. The joint pain is debilitating!! I'm a nurse working full time 12 hr. shifts on a busy ward walking many kilometers a shift. I need my brain, my stamina and my  body to work optimally!I am struggling to walk or stand by the end of a shift due to severe ankle, foot and knee swelling inflamation and pain. I'm at the end of my patience with my quality of life on this med but fear the cancer recurring if I quit! ",4
"I had a double mastectomy with 4 positive lymph nodes and was Her2 positive. Spent a year taking Herceptin. I was started on arimidex 2 months before I finished my chemotherapy so did not realize for a while that the fatigue, continued hair loss, nausea, sleep problems and joint pain were because of the arimidex. My diabetes, which had been under control before the arimidex, became unmanageable. My oncologist refused to accept that the arimidex was causing any side effects. A few weeks ago I experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. My oncologist immediately took me off the arimidex while continuing to insist that I was not having side effects from the drug, but that I had heart disease. After a complete battery of tests my cardiologist told my oncologist that there was nothing wrong with my heart. My oncologist prescribed aromisin, which has the same and worse side effects. I have been off of arimidex for 3 weeks and finally feel like I am recovering from my chemotherapy, which actually ended in February (it is now October). I have decided to stop the drugs. I have had a negative PET scan and my blood work continues to show that I am cancer free. At age 65 I would like to live my life, and not merely exist. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it then. I am very happy with my decision but would not recommend it for everyone. You need to decide which is more important to you - doing what your doctor says will help or having a better quality of life. Also, there is no guarantee that the cancer will not recur just because one takes the drug.",3
"I was diagnosed with grade three invasive duct carcinoma with lymph nodes umors present and Paget`s carcinoma of the nipple in the left breast. After the mastectomy and 7 months of chemotherapy I was placed on Anastrozole, generic for Armidex. I have been taking it now for 5 months. I am 64 years old and have Rheumatoid Arthritis, Fibromylgia, Neuropathy and osteoarthritis. The Armidex has caused my already painful resistance unbearable !!!  I get nauseated and the level of my depression scares me. My ophthalmologist says that my vision has worsened 68% since starting the medicine. My family says that I am totally despondent the majority of the time. Also, I do not act like myself and the irritability causes me not to even want to be around myself. I guess due to lack of sleep. I'm very afraid to stop it because when I call the doctor's office, all I get back is, «it's more important than the chemotherapy. I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do. ",1
"As a fit 41 year old I have found Armidex terrible!! Night sweats, hot flashes and join pain just un bearable . Having a active family with a beautiful six year old daughter the fatigue and depression is debilitating . I have only been taking this medication fora a month and certainly need some encouragement to give it 10 years !!!!!!",3
"I had a low grade carcinoma and lumpectomy with two lymph nodes removed both of which were clear as well as the surrounding tissue of the small tumor.  I have been taking the generic form of Arimidex, Anastrozole, for 20 days and have decided to discontinue the use.  I never experience side effects to medications I have taken in the past so I deliberately did not read the insert of side effects so that I wouldn't put the thought into my head that I would experience them.  In this short period of time I have suffered Waves of Nausea, Exhaustion, overall Body Pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, Sleeplessness and Hot Flashes that could smelt iron ore.  I just looked at the side effects two days ago just to make sure I wasn't imagining that I could feel this miserable. The doctor wants me to take Effexor for the hot flashes but I vetoed that idea since I've not read anything positive about attempting to get off of that drug.  Taking one drug to mask the side effects of another just doesn't seem like a sound solution.  Unlike some other reviews I've read, I don't have the luxury of staying home and dealing with the side effects.  I have the responsibility of a job which I need to attend to daily and Arimidex most definitely is not conducive to this way of life. I wish you all well if you are prescribed this medication.",1
"I am having bad hot flashes, sleeplessness, face rash, sweating, weakness hip weakness, and back problems. I have bad arthritis so I am not sure if it causes it to be worse or not.

Started Arimidex in Jan 2014. Within a matter of a few weeks the hands & fingers began numbness, sensitivity, joint pain in fingers and elbows. Progressively gotten worse. Now my feet are experiencing what my hands are. I experience terrible hot flashes and do have trouble staying asleep. IDK what a 'trigger' finger is but my thumb flicks at the 1st joint and is extremely painful and recently gone into my wrist.

I have been on Arimidex for one month and have had less hot flushes than before I went on it.  I am almost 60 and had surgery for early stage breast cancer and am starting radiotherapy.

Oncologist put me on Femera, but the aches and pain were worse. Now I have 6 trigger fingers, constant shoulder and elbow pain. The swelling in my hands and knees have been unbearable.  My blood work indicates that my cholesterol is increasing. Now I am watching my blood pressure increase.  So, no more pills. No more Effexor of hot flashes either.  I do take a Biotin supplement for hair thinning - hair has thickened.  I have chosen quality over quantity for my life.  I have always been extremely active, but this past 1 1/2 yrs has been miserable.  I hope other folks have better luck, but after reading reviews, I am so very grateful to know I am not crazy.  My primary doctor even said my side effects were in my head - which I pointed out the side effects had not affected my head yet!  Good luck folks.  ",3
"Many ""side effects"" can be easily related to other healthcare issues.  Hard to pinpoint directly to drug.",4
"I got dizzy, dr said to take med at night.  Helps, but wake up dizzy.  Mussel pains. Nothing I can't stand if its helping me. ",4
"Started generic Anastrozole May 2013; achy joints, weakness in hips; general itchiness; depression.  Willing to live with those issues.  Developed itchy watery eyes in April of 2013 which has gotten worse.  Started loosing hair in May of 2014.  Have lost approximately a third of my hair in just a few months.    ",4
"I have been on anastrazole for about a month an a half. The side effects have been night sweats, dry skin, and inability to sleep. Over all it has been worth it.",5
major hair thinning-muscular aches in the evening-,4
"After 13  months on Arimidex I have taken a ""drug holiday"" to see if the joint pain, aches, stiffness, fatigue, sleeeplessness, depression and general poor quality of life will improve. The plan is to be off for 4 weeks then try a different aromatoase inhibitor. I had a partial mastectomy and  weeks of radiation for stage I node negative ER positive HER2 negative breast cancer. I would like to see  more accurate reporting/rates of s/e from this med in medical journals so doctors have a better understanding of how this drug affects our quality of life.",4
numbness in my hands and feet sleepless nights joint and mussel pain and overall aweful feeling. They don't tell you all this when you finish treatment. They make it seem like the chemos over and in a coup weeks your life will be back to normal.,1
"5 weeks of taking this drug resulted in extreme worsening of bone and muscle pain. Had been taking tamoxifen,however switched to Arimidex as i had worsening asthma symptoms and needed stronger meds not compatible with Tamoxifen. Wish i had not! This medicine is horrid Will return to Tamoxifen after body pain lessens",1
"5 years ago I had breast cancer that was estrogen positive. After mastectomy, genome testing, and 5 years of Arimidex, I am approved to stop taking it. While taking Arimidex, I did have hot flashes, thining of bone, higher cholesterol, but all controlled. Now that I am off Arimidex, I wonder what to expect in terms of effects.",5
"Cancer of left breast, my choice double mastectomy .Chemo, radiation treatments for 6 weeks. Arimidex then prescribed. Have been taking it for 3 and a half yrs. Constipation and issue for me and minor bone and joint pain in the beginning not so much now. Changing to the brand name to see if it will help with the constipation issues.  ",4
"My doctor suggested taking this drug one year after I had finished taking tamoxifen for five years.  I take one pill every day and have been cancer free now for six years.  I experienced depression almost immediately after starting this medication.  I began taking a second medication that eliminates that side effect.  I also experienced similar problems with depression while taking tamoxifen. After taking Arimidex for about one year, I began experiencing joint pain which has escalated to the point that I have pain in the joints of my thumbs which is very painful and affects my ability to write.  I also experience an overall achiness in my arms and legs. I take Advil and Tylenol to relieve the discomfort, however, I am concerned about my bone health and mobility.",4
"I'm so relieved after reading all the reviews. They helped confirm that I'm not going crazy and this drug is not a good match for me and other similar drugs wouldn't be a good match either. The acute anxiety, insomnia, feeling a lack of self, brain fog and memory loss, lack of energy, feeling unhappy without reason....the psychological effects have been worse than physical discomfort except for the occasional headache that is only relieved when I resort to a 1/2 hydrocodone left over from the surgery. I'm not the happy me and it's not because I got breast cancer. I've been on this drug since March 2013 and hate it. Warning says not to stop taking without talking to my doctor. I've mentioned these issues and get a sideways look. Going to stop taking this med as soon as this prescription bottle is empty and don't want to even see the oncologist any longer. I have faith I'm cancer free and will remain that way. Quality of life is better than what I'm living now.",3
I am 78 years old. Four years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 1. I had a lumpectomy and 35 radiation treatments. I was put on Anastrozole after the radiation. It has been 3 1/2 years and I can say truthfully the only side effects for me are a thinning of the hair and a few hot flashes. I can live with that. I get a mammogram and Dexascan regularly and all is well. I am happy.  I helped my husband go through a year of lymphoma B cancer stage 4. He had chemo  and passed away 10 months after being diagnosed. Maybe it took my mind off myself and did not dwell on side effects. I felt lucky I was well enough to care fore him.,4
"arimidex causes me to feel fatigue and joints are very acky and at times hurts to walk. Expecially my fingers, they get stiff when I awake in the mornings.",4
"This was prescribed for me for daily dose for  years,after a modified radical mastectomy in 2008, and I have stopped taking it since June 2013. I feel fine now, without signs of recurrence of breast cancer. I just observed that during the treatment, my fingernails developed a wavy surface for a time.",5
"I had my third round of breast cancer starting January, 2013. This time it was in my lungs and a lesion on my spine. I took chemo pills for a few months with no change in my cancer. I was switched to Arimidex (generic)and within a couple months my lung cancer was gone and my lesion was stable (dormant). I have side effects I don't like; weight gain, tiredness, stiffness in joints and general aches. I feel much older than I am. If this keeps my cancer dormant then it is worth it. ",5
I have only been taking a couple of weeks. I was diagnosed with hormone receptor positive DCIS in December 2013. I had a lumpectomy and partial breast radiation for a week. Hot flashes don't seem to be any worse. It seems that I am not sleeping as well. I have no idea on effectiveness. My oncologist told me that my recurrence rate would go from 2% to around 8% if I opt not to take this medication. He said that the results are better than Tamoxifen.   He wants me to have a Prolia injection after taking this medication for a month. I have osteopenia.  I most likely will not take the injection due to all of the horrible side effects and reviews.  I will continue with the pills for now and see how it goes.  I really appreciate everyone's reviews!,3
"Tired, bone pain",3
"Started on generic arimidex July 2013,  not to bad first 5/6 months but lately it has not been pleasant.  Muscle/joint pain,  triger finger, wrist and now back of knee.  Who gets pain in back of knee!!!!  Having a very difficult time sleeping, which makes aches and pains worse, wasn't sure if it was just me, or as my GP says ""well you are 66""  wanted to slap her!!  Didn't feel any where near this bad before the medication.  Will talk with my oncologist and see about something different.  After reading all of the comments I don't feel like it's just me. Thank You",2
"I have been taking this medication for 1 year. I had a lumpectomy and 19 radiation treatments. My cancer was 9 mm. I have had many side effects such as dizziness, bone pain, extreme weakness in my arms, sleepless nights, general exhaustion, tingling and numbness in my toes and fingers.  My radiology oncologist said I should not be feeling this way. I am going to consult my surgeon and consider another medication.",4
I have no idea if it effective or not. No where on the label did it instruct to take at the same time.,2
"Lumpectomy & radiation 2/13 for stage 1, from beginning, lethary, very dry skin, loss of hair, nausea, dizziness along with extreme over all joint pain that greatly interferred w/sleep. Oncologist told me to cease taking for month & re-evaluate.  So far 2 weeks in & more joint pain.  Dr. said I could possibly take Tamoxifin.  I feel constantly  terrible!",2
"I've been on Arimidex for about 6 months after a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. At first everything was fine, but as time goes on my toes get number, my head sweats excessivly with the least amount of exertion (making the bed?) or slight elevation of temperature and I'm getting more muscle aches. Not ready to quit, but if things keep getting worse, I'll consider it. ",5
"I have had a fracture of my right hand and wrist, I am very fatigued, trouble sleeping, hair is  thinning,constipated, depressed, thirsty, hungry trouble urinating pain in my other joints and all over my body.  ",4
"Started taking Anastozole, the generic of Arimidex in 2011 after a mastectomy. Oncologist insisted I take it even though my onco test was 11 which is lower than the number to start radiation or chemo which I haven't had either. Side effects are terrible...extreme blurred vision which is getting worse, terrible pains in arms, legs, extreme weight gain no matter how hard I try to lose it, sleepless nights every night,feeling like an old person and I'm 64 and just no  energy whatsoever. Anyone else experience such blurred vision? What do you do to relieve it?",4
"The medication is very easy to take, as it is once a day.  Side effects have been difficult for me.  Hot flashes throughout the night (not so much in the daytime), sleeping in 1 to 2 hour intervals with insomnia most nights. Joint pain began at about 8 weeks.  It was excruciating initially.  I had auricular therapy to help with the pain as well as heavy doses of ibuprofen, 800 mg four times a day.  Now am on nabumetone 750 mg three times a day for the pain.  After about 4 months the pain is better, and I have found that walking and exercise have helped as well.  The most frustrating thing now is the weight gain.  Have been on Weight Watchers for 3 months and have lost 4 lbs, even with 4 hours/week aerobic exercise.  I have never been depressed before, but this could be the first time. . . I am losing my sunny disposition.  ",4
"Had lumpectomy and radiation almost 5 years ago. 2 years on Tamoxifen which caused thickening of the uterous and generally feeling lousy. 3 years on Arimidex this coming February and then I am DONE. Vaginal dryness, depressed and now on Boniva since bones got very bad. My main complaint is no sex drive. I have been married 38 years and we really miss that. Hope it comes back. Oncologist said it could be a side effect, not sure. ",5
In November 2011 I was diagnosed with Stage 3 inflammatory breast cancer in my left breast. I had 3 months of chemo. In April 2012 I had a mastechomy. From March 2012 thru July 2012 I had 30 treatments of radiation. I have been on Arimidex for 1 year and 2 months. I am 61 but I feel like 80. I am exhausted all the time. I have trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. I never get a good night's sleep. I have pain throughout my body. Aches and pains and stiffness all the time. I feel better if I keep moving. I get stiff when I stay in bed for more than a few hours.  I have stiffness in my hands and pain in my left elbow. I have tingling and numbness in my hands and feet.  I have trouble with descriptive words and I suffer from memory loss. Sometimes I can't even get up from the chair.I take 2 Anacins before I go to bed in the hope that the pain doesn't wake me up during the night. I try to stay positive. As long as this drug keeps the cancer away it is worth it.  I do less and I stay home more. This is the new normal. I do whatever works and everyone just has to understand that I cannot do what I used to do. ,3
"Took Arimidex after a small breast cancer tumor (stage 1) was found on a mammogram.  Had issues with tingling in my fingers.  Very dry skin and hair.  Issues with vitamin D levels being too low.  THEN, metastatic breast cancer developed.  Cancer spread to my lungs and liver after about 4 years of taking Arimidex.  It didn't work. ",1
increased joint pain and hot flashes for invasive lobular breast cancer stage 11 non  metastatic. post operative ,2
"Well, when you consider the alternative...it works well, complete with all side effects. I have been taking it since 2009 and am finally on the last months. I wish everyone good luck. Make sure your care giver understands the problems with this drug. It will help them to deal with all the side effects.",4
nausea,1
"Joint pain,  breast is hurting, headaches, depression and always tired",2
"Diagnosed dcis, lumpectomy and rads.  Started taking generic arimidex Oct 2012, felt horrible.  Dec, thought I was feeling better, told to hang in there.  Today, I made the decision to stop taking the med.  I have severe joint pain, hips on down, terrible leg & toe cramps, finger cramps, unsteadiness, depressed, tired, lack of concentration, forgetfulness, weight gain and that is what I can feel.  What is going on inside of me?  This has been the worse year of my life, even worse than surgery and rads.  Go back to oncologist in Nov & will see what else I can do.",2
How do I know if it is effective or not??--Have taken it for only a month,1
bad body aches!,1
Hot flashes so bad my head is soaking wet. Bone pain. Trouble sleeping. Weight gain,5
I have had no side effects.  My blood pressure has lowered to normal numbers.  Colestrol is in the normal range.  I do have night sweats.  But they are only about 1 a night.,5
"I have taken the drug arimidex (now the generic version anastrazole) and have experienced many adverse side effects. The most problematic is lack of sleep and some weight gain (particularly in my gut area). This is despite exercising more than I have ever done. There is also stiffness, some pain and the general feeling of being unwell. Sometimes it is hard to get around as my joints seem unpredictable and my muscles taunt. I now have very high cholesterol and high blood pressure (both new issues) and recurrent depression and anxiety disorder. Overall, I prefer to remain at home where there are no expectations of me and I do not have the stress of preparing to go out or coping in social settings. This includes seeing my immediate family which makes me feel even more guilty. I have taken the drugs for a year and a half and do not have a foreseeable end to this. It seems to unfair to survive the surgery and chemotherapy and then have this ongoing problem with really no tangible ways to cope. ",2
"Had to go off Tamoxifen after 2 years. Uterus kept thickening. Have been on Arimidex for 2 1/2 years. Ca 27-29 still very low. Take lots of vitamins after cancer diagnosis. Anxiety has worsened but due to other life issues (I think). I take meds for anxiety for that. Main complaint is my nails. Very, very  brittle and thin. Gelatin doesn't help that too well. Hair a little brittle. Much more tolerable than Tamoxifen. Also, had to start Boniva for my severe osteoporosis. Only 1/2 year to go!  Also am 15 lbs. heavier and was always thin. Now I know why!",5
I have been on this med for a year. Can not tolerate it . I want to stop taking it.,5
"Have been taking Arimidex since 1997. Original diagnosis and mastectomies 1988. Minor (tiny tumor) recurrences in 1992 and 1997. Tamoxifen 1992-1997. Other than occasional flushes, no noticeable side effects. This med causes osteoporosis, but so far, not much. (Walk an hour a day, do strenuous cardo, and free weights to help counteract this effect.) So far, so good.",5
"severe hot flashes, joint pain, headaches,no energy, blood pressure has been low since starting this medication.",3
I have the script for this in my purse and just not ready to deal with the side-effects.  Just in my 2nd week of radiation tx. Lump removed earlier this summer and no spreading to nodes found.  Quality of life far more important right now.  Thanks to all of you for sharing.,1
"When I started taking this drug I had alot of joint pain, no energy and overall felt like a very old woman.  After 2 years, I was prescribed 10mg of dexedrine for another reason and most of the side effects disappeared.  It was like a miracle.  Overall energy up, minimal joint pain, less hot flashes etc.  Don't know if it is a good choice for others but it seems like a very small dose has made all the difference in the world",5
"I have been on the generic for 13 months. Hair on head is getting thicker, facial hair has increased, belly fat hard to get rid of. Tired all the time, except at night, then wide awake.  Joint pain has just started in hips, shoulders, & ankles. Don't know whether to stop, Dr says no.  Breast cancer was stage 1, clean nodes, had radiation 2x day for 5 days. So far, cancer free. ",3
"Stage 2 and one lymph node removed in 12/2012.  Chemo & rad then Tamoxifin.  On generic since 7/2012.  Hot flashes, thinning hair, depression, ringing in one ear -has anyone experienced this?  Overall ok but will it ever improve? Time will tell.",3
"Although I was so afraid to start this because of all of the reported side effects, I am glad to report that I have had basically no problems with SEs. When I mentioned to my doctor that everyone online reported terrible side effects, he  pointed out to me that usually the people that are doing ok rarely do the surveys and that is why it seems that the majority of the reviews are negative.  I have occasional stiffness but since I had it before taking Arimidex,  I have to attribute it more to aging. Hope all who are starting it are as lucky.",5
"I was diagnosed back in 2008, had a lumpectomy and radiation. Began taking one cancer drug but after about 8 months found that the joint pain was so bad i could not even get up from the chair. I was switched to a second drug and after 4 month found that the headaches were so bad i was throwing up on almost a daily basis. Was then switched to Tamoxifen even though i was post menopausol. No side effects, i felt great BUT my gyn doctor found lots uterin fybroids (sp) and after surgery was told i had to be put on the last resort, arimedex. My oncologist warned me that i may have joint pain like my first drug but she did not tell me about the hair loss, or blinding daily headaches or strange pains in my thumbs and it's only been 4 months. I'm supposed to be on this until Oct 2015 and I'm not sure what else to do. I can't stand the headaches anymore. This drug is not something that should be prescribed to most people at least in my opinion.",4
"I was on Tamoxifen and experienced a lot of side effects initially but I stayed on it and the side effects went away about 4 months after being on it.  As soon as my body finally adjusted to Tamoxifen I was switched to Arimidex which is slightly more effective in preventing breast cancer reoccurence. I didn't have any side effects for the first two months I was on Arimidex.  After two months I started getting sharp pains in my feet, knees, hips and tailbone.  The hip pain is very noticeable at night when I have been lying down for any duration. I don't sleep through the night because I can't get comfortable. I have a lot of headaches now and my memory seems to be getting fuzzy again. Additionally been feeling very moody and weepy. Exercise REALLY helps with the side effects brought on by this drug, but its challenging to find the motivation when you are stiff, tired and moody.  Will be giving this drug a couple more months to see if I adjust to it; otherwise I will ask to be switched because the side effects really affect my quality of life.  ",2
"I have been taking this RX for about 2 years, and I have been having painss and aches. Which I was told have turned into arthritis. I have pain in my right elbow, right wrist, both knees- which I had to get injections for. I am so tired all the time and my appitite comes and goes. I just wish I could be happy with this medicine, but to be honest I have stopped taking it a few times due to the pain. I even take Vicodin to help with getting aggitated from the Arimidex. That doesn't even seem to help my pain. I pray that we all get some relief soon. Good luck everyone.  Brenda T. Indianapols, In",4
"Can't talk about effectiveness since that depends on the outcome of being cancer free overtime. basic little complaints, hot flashes, nausea, a few pounds gained. but what i hate most about this medication is that i have libido but vaginal dryness is horrible and difficulty in reaching orgasm. I hate having ""blue lips"" symptoms, like men have blue balls!!! any suggestions.",1
"When I first took the Arimidex, the tumor size reduced significantly.  However, when I changed it to Aromacin (not too sure correct spelling) my tumor size grew significantly.  I am very glad that I did not have surgery/I actually can tell whether my tumor is reduced/increased",5
"constipation,depression ,lack of motivation muscle weakness One plus sleping 6hours a night instead of 5.",3
"I was wondering if anyone has tried taking 1/2 pill to ease the side effects and if 1/2 pill would be as effective, have any studies been done on this?",1
"I been taking this for 9 months now. I have had alot of joint pain, hand swelling, tigger finger both middle fingers lock up.Very stiff in the morning can't hardly get out of bed. I have also been very fatigue.I sure hope this working no way of knowing but I have had 2 good scans so far.I am 42 yrs old and I feel like Im 65. I try to keep moving but I am so tired feeling.Im scared cause I have along time to go... hope this helps anyone or if anyone has any tips for me, Let me know",2
"been on arimidex for 4 yrs this month and feel worse as time goes by.  Reading the side effects that others have posted here makes me realize I am not crazy, like I'm feeling, but that the bone pain in legs, hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, nausea and irritable bowel are likely all caused by this drug.  I am too scared of cancer recurrence to stop it now, but next Sept, if the doc wants me to continue, I'll definitely think twice about that.  I'm grateful to be cancer free and be here, but I want back some quality of life and just a little bit of energy! ",4
"Severe joint pain in hips and shoulders; extreme fatique, extreme hot flashes/night sweats.",2
The drug has some unpleasant side effects but does work well for me.,5
"Well so far I have had several side effects. Constipation,headaches,dizziness,muscle aches,can't sleep at night,tired all the time ! Only been on it 2 months so I ma not sure it has been effective for treating the cancer spot on my C-7 vertebrea. I had stage 2 Breast Cancerin 5/2004 and had chemo,mastectomyand radiation. And everything was fine until I statrted to have back pain and went to the DR and had a bone scan and a MRI in May/2012 and that is when the sopt on my spine was dicovered.      Going for another Bone scan and MRI at the end of this month to find out if Arimedex( I take the generic and it is only $20.11 at Wal-Mart) ",4
"I had a mastectomy (L breast) and this is what my doctor put me on. I had 1 lip-node taken out and it was negative. I've been taking the med for 2 months and can say (at least for now) I've been satisfied. I do have hot flashes, joint pain and get tired terribly easy (dr says I'm severely anemic and I will be starting an Iron drip next month). If this is the only side effects I have and the cancer doesn't come back, I'll be HAPPY !!    ",4
so far Im  nauseated every day.,1
I took Arimidex for a year and it was the worst year of my life.So many side affects and i felt terrable all the time. I went off of it after a year and made my doctor put me on Tamoxifen.  I feel 100 percet better.,1
I took this drug for 6 months.  I have had every side effect except bleeding.  I  stopped taking it 1 month ago.  I am still experiencing SEVERE burning bone pain.  Pain meds are ineffective.  Memory problems are present.  Weight gain is a problem.  Sleep is a problem.  Jesus is my only hope!,1
"can't stand the not sleeping, i take it in the morning with breakfast, yet come bedtime, i am wide awake. also, since i take it in the am, why do i get hot flashes at bedtime, after taking it like 12 hours later? Would like an answer to this question.",3
So far no side effects,5
"I was diagnosed in July 2010 with stage 1 lobular carcinoma.  After a lumpectomy, I had 36 treatments of radiation.  I have been taking Arimidex since November of 2010, along with an anti-depressant, Effexor.  I have experienced nausea (which has lessoned over time) and also joint pain.  The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).  I have gained weight, but feel that has been a direct result of my feeling tired alot and not exercising like I should.  I broke my shoulder in March of 2011 and my Dr. immediately did a bone density test and found that I was fine.  While I am not enjoying the side-effects,  I realize that lobular breast cancer is one that recurs more frequently and I will be continuing the Arimidex because of that.  I have also read that those of us that experience joint pain are less likely to have a recurrence of the cancer after taking the Arimidex.  ",3
"I've used this for 5 months.  Initially, swollen hands/feet and lots of bone/joint pain.  No hair thinning, no libido either.  But hot flashes/night sweats.  Pain in hands, feet, and hips.  From reading a drug side effect list of other AI drugs, this looks to have the least problems.  Trying to figure out the best pain management approach. Finally, I answered that this has been highly effective, but not can't really tell if it is or not.  Only 55 more months to go...then I should know if it's effective or not.",5
"I completed 5 years of tomoxifen with no or little problems. I have been on Arimidex for 1 yr. and the pain, joint swelling, sleepless nights have just about taken their toll on me. My joints in my hands are hard balls and I can't open my hands fully anymore.  The arthritis has increased in my feet, am going to have bone fusion surgery in the upcoming month due to the severe pain and significant deteriation noted through x-rays. (in only 1 yr. on this drug)  Breast cancer, then this the rest of my life?..not sure what I will do. My fingers have deformed and it is very painful going about my daily routine.  I was a very active mother of 4, tennis everyday, still full of life outwardly,  I have a high tolerance for pain, never complained about chemo, radiation...etc.  This has changed my life more than all of that, just doesn't seem right that this is keeping me alive, but my quality of life suffers more and more everyday I'm on this drug.   Will be meeting with my oncologist this week for other options I have heard are no better. Don't misunderstand as I am grateful to be alive!",4
Only notable side effect is hot flashes.,5
real bad joint pain flare ups could not get out of bed at times.,3
"Cancer is back, after 4 years. I was forced into menopause and had hot flashes every 5 mins with Tamxofin. Stopped it. I'm now taking Arimidex and so far so good.  I think it makes a difference with side effects if you start this medication while you are going through chemo and radiaation. My cancer is in 3 spots but has not spread.  The hardest part is this just wait and see it the drug works.  Luckily, my Dr. did a blood test with a tumor marker so we have a starting point.  As long as everything stays put and just shrinks I'm good. I do everything I can combat side effects. If you ache, take Motrin or Aleve. Get moving, eat right. If you are doing chemo, after 48 hrs, the drugs have done their work.  Get into a hot tub or suana and get that stuff out of your system.  The quicker it leaves you body the better.  Take a good multi vitamin, Vit. D and B. Advocate for yourself.  I went to the Mayo for a 2nd opin and they agreed with the treatment My Dr. suggested.  Everyday is a gift.  I have a 13yr.old to raise yet and 4 grandchildren. I'm going to live life and fight all the way!",4
Started on Arimidex ten months ago. The only problem I have is some moderate pain in my right hand and right wrist which started recently. I have been having good labs and had two good scans in Jan. this year. I feel so far it is working for me.,5
"I and 4 1/2 yrs out as a B C survivor. I feel like one of the lucky ones have no real side effects...with the expection of hair loss and and bone loss in my spine. I have no pain to speak of, no hot flashes, slight numbness in my left foot which i had after chemo. I can continue after 5 yrs if i choose to do so. any comments from experienced fellow Arimidex takers.    ",5
"I've been on Armidex for 2 1/2 years with hot flashes as my primary side effect. HOWEVER, I have a very smart oncologist who, in addition to the Arimidex, prescribed ZOMETA treatments for me every 3 months during this time.  Some docs, I've heard, recommend them monthly, but my doc says that every 3 months is effective and eliminates the side effect of bone loss in the jaw that the monthly treatments have caused with some patients.  ZOMENTA puts calcium back in the body that Arimidex leaches out.  Good luck to all and hopefully your doc will prescribe the Zometa for you, too!",5
"When I saw my oncologist a month after starting this medication I asked him if it was working. He said he had no way of knowing for the individual patient. In the clinical trials it reduced the risk of recurrence in 1/2 of the women but not in the other half and he could not tell which category I fell into. 6 weeks after I started the medication I developed a strong metallic taste in my mouth so that it was impossible to eat or drink anything but water and a soft boiled egg. My doctor had never heard of this side effect. When I researched it on the internet I found the symptom sometimes occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy (when your hormones are chaotic) or could be due to a deficiency in zinc. I self prescribed zinc which seemed to address the taste problem; I now take a zinc supplement daily. My cholesterol levels have gone from 200 to 250 in only three months and I have gained 10 lbs that I can't seem to lose despite good diet and exercise. I have osteopenia and am being watched for further bone density loss; so far it is minimal. I do bone pounding exercises (running, jumping rope and jumping jacks) to improve bone density. I am working on my balance to avoid the falls that can be so dangerous for women of my age (65) and diagnosis.",1
"Iam new to this medication.  I started taking arimidex about 3 weeks ago.  I just turned 47 and for my birthday I had my fallopian and ovaries remove.  Breast cancer is prevailant in my family.  But only after 3 weeks,  I notice that I have been getting dizzy and have terrible cramping in my feet and lower legs!  I do have the fatique and bloated feeling in my stomach.  So, is there something else that I could take?  This drug is worse than all the treatment that I went through.  I also am experiencing lower back pain.  I have a young son, so I'll do whatever it takes to survive. But it isn't limited to taking this drug! I've read all the comments and it frightens me!  3 years of hell now this!  I'll give it until my 3 month check up to decide if this drug is right for me!",3
"Diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in July 2011.  Surgery to remove mass and took out 4 lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes were negative but could not get clear tissue around the mass.  Had mastectomy in Sept. 2011.  Surgeon did not see any need for chemo or radiation. Breast tissued tested and only a 10% chance of recurring. Sent to ongologist and I'll have to say he was the most arrogant doctor ever.  He demanded I take arimidex to rid my body of the estrogren, even though I'm 67 years old and my ovaries are completely dried up, they do not even show up on a c-scan.  He also wanted me to take Fosmax to increase my bone density.  I took Armidex for one month and all the side effects listed I had them.  Dr. said I had to stay on this.  Tried for another month and the side effects got worse.  Extreme anxity and depression, joint pain so bad I couldn't walk, can't sleep, body aches and muscle pain real bad.  I have irratible bowel anyway and it has really messed me up.  My gut hurts all day no matter what I eat.  I switched to another oncologist and she says the benefit far outweighs the side effects.  Been off the meds for 6 weeks and not much improvement yet.  I will never take Foxamax after learning the high risk of its side effects and the class action law suit now is progress.  Get on the web and get all  the horrible info. about this.   Know a woman who took this and almost died from the holes it ate in her stomach and gut.  I will take my chances without the meds and try to get my life back.  I'd rather have a few years of quality life than live like this. I think drs. want to scare us into taking these meds and they're always pushing pills at us. Most days can't even get out of bed.  I was in good health until this happened. Glad some of you are not suffering.  Hang in there girls!",1
"I have been most fortunate as I am almost finished with my drug therapy, have had my first mamogram since surgery (all clear) and have had no known side effects; if the small amount of fatigue is from the medication, I can live with that until my therapy with the drug is complete; then be amazed when the fatigue disappears.  this has been a very successful drug in my particular case",5
I used this drug for 3 years and 4 months thinking I was doing fine on it. Suddenly I felt like my crotch was on fire. It took another 2 months of doctor appointments and medical procedures before I had a doctor that made the connection. Vaginal dryness given as a side effect is a huge under-statement. I've been free of this drug for 10 weeks and on estrogen cream for 4 weeks and am still miserable.,4
I took Arimidex for a year and a half following three years on Tamoxifen.  The side effects were pretty bad.  It caused me to develop some pretty bad arthritis and joint pain as well as weight gain and depression.  I have broken both legs in the following years even though my bone density scans fall around the normal range.  I also had a tremendous problem with my tendons swelling and being painful and suffered a partial tear in my Achilles tendon that required surgery and being in a wheelchair and cast for several months.  I stopped taking it when my other leg felt like it was having the same problems.  I switched to Femara for the remainder of my treatment and was much more satisfied with it.  It has been 8 1/2 years that I have been free from cancer but am now undergoing tests as we feel my cancer may have returned.  Glad to have had the 8 years but 5 of them were in pretty bad pain.,4
"Dizziness, blurred eyes,sleepless nights,triggehir finger, low levell depression fatgue.",2
"This medication has side effects especially joint pain, occ. nausea, and hot flashes but has worked well for me.. MY ca 125 is down to 23. ",5
"Have not had bothersome side effects from this med so far, but am experiencing hair thinning.    Some aches in a hip and knee, lack of sex drive, minor hot flashes occasionally, that I have experienced all could be due to regular aging, my pre-existing overweight and lack of exercise.  So far this med has not bothered me.  Wondering if hair grows back after being off this drug. Hopefully, this will be the only problem for next three and a half years of treatment. Also wondering what effect the removal of estrogen will have on our hearts. Will be praying for all who have had difficulty with this drug, to be blessed with comfort and good health.  Also, will be exercising! ",4
"Taking this med for approx. 2 months.Extreme lower back pain 2 weeks after started, brushed it off. At this point just using my arms is very painful. My shoulders are in extreme pain. Talked to oncologist nurse and am changing to another but as of today I just want to cry I am sick of all this pain. Did not have any of this before!! I am in no way a baby, and can handle pain but even I have reached my limits. Hope this helps someone else who is experiencing the same issues with this drug. I made it through the battle of cancer for this??  Hopefully the next drug will not be like this! ",4
I was fine using Arimidex until they changed to a generic...my side effects are getting to be severe.  Hard to tell if I have a serious virus or it is from my medication.  I have every side effect that is displayed above...what is in the generic?  Absolutely not the same thing!,4
"I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in 2007.  I had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation.  I've been taking this medication since March, 2008.  The main side effect I have experienced is joint and bone pain.  After sitting for a period of time I feel achy and struggle somewhat to stand up.  My bone density is now at 2.3 with 2.5 being osteoporosis.  I was prescribed Fosamax but cannot take it because it caused me to have severe gas pains. I will continue to take Arimidex for 2 more years with the hope that it will help to prevent a recurrence.  Not sure about taking another osteoporosis medication.",4
In my fourth year with lots of severe roving bone pain and now muscle pain has started. Anyone know if any of the side effects are permanent?,4
I have been on Arimidex for a year with no problems.  I keep a positive attitude and am grateful for any meds that will keep me healthy.,5
"I have not taken this drug yet. I should be starting next month. I am not sure that I will after reading the comments. I already have osteopenia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and vaginal dryness. They are all under control with meds. I do not want to start having problems in these areas or create new problems for myself. I am so afraid of taking this now.",3
"The only side effects I have are extreme hot flashes, and mental confusion at times.  1 more year to go. I was having pain, swelling and numbness in my hands but that stopped once I quit taking glucosamine.",5
"I thought I had it made..no symptoms except a little weight gain, but I've been battling that for the last few years. Now my thumb is locking up and I had no idea it was from the Rx until reading the other reviews. I am achy after sitting for a short time and have really sharp pain in the back of my hand sometimes when I pick something up, even a cup of coffee. My cholesterol/triglycerides are rising tho I've never had a problem before. I'm glad to know I'm not just being a complainer without reason. I just hope it doesn't get progressively worse. The prospect of the cancer coming back is more scary than the thought of more side effects.  I am lucky to have a supportive, patient husband. God Bless all of you and keep the faith!  ",4
"Had lumpectomy in 2/11, 4 chemo treatments and 36 radiation sessions completed by 8/11. Started arimidex 8/11 and 4 months later I am tired more than ususal, have hot flashes, finger joint pain and knee pain. Sitting any lenghth of time feels like I'm 95 when I get up to move. Can't do any repetitive movements with my fingers on a computer too long or they lock up..especially my right hand.  I use a computer to do payroll for my job.   Wonder what I'll be like when my five years are up on this drug. Seeing my doc next month!!  ",2
I guess it has worked cause I don't think I have cancer anymore.  I never had a pet scan though.  My dexa scan is worse.  I stopped femara due to pain.   and my hair was thick 4 years after treatment but is now very thin.  I'm 57.,5
I can't believe this medication would be prescribed to anyone.   Out of the 20 possible side affects I had 17 within the first week.   ,1
"Same as most everyone else. Hair is still okay  after 1+ year of treatment. Has anyone ever lost the weight gained on this drug? I know that when I was on heavy duty IV chemo they told me that my fingernails would recover-they haven't. Kind of leary about the whole thing. Are there any natural treatments, Vitamins? Anything else?",5
"This medication is difficult to take in the beginning of treatment.  Huge side effects and it takes almost 6 months to adjust physically and mentally.  It takes a very positive attitude to continue and not to give up.  I discussed often with the oncologist.  Still have side effects, such as somnolence, insomnia and loss of energy, hairloss, but it is better than the alternatives, considering my condition.  All I can say to women who start out with this medication ""hang in there, eventually it will get better""....If nauseated, because that also happens in the beginning, drink ginger ale, or chew ginger gum.",5
"Joint pain, fatigue, neuropathy, soles of hands hot and painful most of the time. Stabbing pain in 2 to 3 toes at a time. Wrists painful, ankles and elbow bone. Not a pleasant experience,very painful, had to stop it. 1 week into Arimisan joint pain, but not as bas as with Arimidex",2
Am on my 10th month of this med and have not experienced any problems.  Have had mamos on both breasts and so far A-OK.  Have just had my 2nd Zometa infusion also with no problems.  Had oncology visit this past week with good results.  We should all be happy that these meds are avaulable.  Good health to all of us.,5
"I had less than stage 1 breast cancer.  Lumpectomy and radiation and then began taking Arimidex.  After one week I lost my will to live. Depression, joint pain so severe I could not sleep. After 9 days I stopped on my own.  Dr. is recommending Tamoxofen but reviews are similar with side effects so I am going to heal with vitamins, exercise and diet.",1
"At the beginning I felt fine....no unusual pain or complaints.  After a few months, I began to have significant breathing problems on exertion. My oncologist said it wasn't the pill.  But after every test known to modern medicine, it appears to be the pill.  Now off of it for 3 1/2 months, I feel back to normal.  Now I have no idea what to do. ",3
"within three months,  have high blood pressure for the first time in my life,  exgtremely high cholesterol and triglycerides and osteoarthrtis in all major joints - need vitamin D now and 7 RX;s to counteract the side effects.  I am in my 3rd year.  The gerneric started all the side effects of hot flashes, headaches all over again but was $250 less that the real thing - what a scam",3
After 4 months on medication I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis; had 20 lb weight gain after several months and then 7 months into treatments SEVERE headaches began daily for  5 months; brain MRI was normal; I stopped medication (on my own) and within 2 days headache was gone; still some joint pain that I will probably have for the rest of my life.  My doctor is now trying me on Femara due to chance of cancer returning.  Don't like the thoughts of another medication but am willing to give it a try and prayerfully the side effects won't be as severe. ,1
"Have serious joint pains, weight gain and hot flashes.  Thinking of going off it due to the knee and hip and hand problems.",3
Ihave been taking this medicine for about a month with no noticeable side effects.  ,4
"Early stage BC and the tumor was small. Biopsy Nov 2010, Lumpectomy Dec 2010. Radiation Feb-March 2011.  OncoType DX test results showed I was at low risk of the cancer coming back. I had reservations about Arimidex  because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. Said I had ""no choice"". I started taking the generic form at the end of April 2011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects. Pain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away eventually,) not sleeping, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, weight loss, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an ""unlikely but very serious side affect"" and to call doctor immediately. Oncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did, and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. Hmmm. She didn't put me on anything else. Anyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone, although the appetite is taking a while to come back, but I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months. Good luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.",2
"Diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma III Jan 2010-chemo Feb to Jun 2010-double mastectomy Jul 2010-radiation therapy Sept to Oct 2010 - began taking Arimidex October 2010.  Immediate side affects joint/bone pain especially after sitting awhile and sleeping.  July 2011 began gaining weight, difficulty falling and staying asleep additional side affects.  I Cannot imagine another 4 plus years of this.  I see my oncologist the end of this month and will likely cease taking - difficult to weigh the risks of recurrence against quality of existence.  Very unhappy.",4
"I had invasive lobular carcinoma- bilateral mastectomy w/axillary pad removal, sentinal removal~ 4 of 8 nodes involved- 6 chemos/33 radiation treatments. Was first put on Aromasin-started having diarrhea, doc said once started, that doesn't go away; put me on tamoxifen started having pain & bad migraines.  Doctor changed it to EVISTA, much, much better.  It is an estrogen blocker with bone builder in it.  Has been around a long time used for bone health.  I also have osteopenia from the chemo.  Side effects not so bad.  Doctor said my bones had improved & to keep doing what I was doing.  I also take 18,000 units Vit. D3 each day, morning, noon & night split.  My D levels were just about middle, but in the good range.Then NEW oncologist wanted me on aromatose inhibitor; my former experiences were ignored. They put on tamoxifen, side effects worse, 10 lb. weight gain in 1 month, can't get it off, lots of pain, headaches; then put on Arimidex- pain in bones so bad in the a.m. I could hardly stand, knees, all joints, hands...gave me neuropothy in 3 toes on each foot, from little toe in, STILL hasn't gone away. I had more weight gain, brain fog, felt like I walked like an old person, felt myself going into a deep hole (depression), on Effexor XR, both arms went numb and tightness across my chest, hands went numb & my radiation oncologist asked me why I was slurring my speech. I had to work to put words & sentences together, I put it together & stopped taking it, I could actually feel the fog lifting. I still have some symptoms. First oncologist opened back up, I went back and he put me back on Evista!   Do not take this medicine, not worth it!!  I was diagnosed & had sugery in 11/06!     ",1
"Took Arimidex 18 months. Off for 4 weeks then will try a different drug. Developed trigger finger, joint pain, very dry eyes, sleep problems, hot flashes, memory issues. Praying another drug will be kinder.",3
"On arimidex 22 days, severe pain in ankles, knees, wrists and fingers.  Cannot walk 9 holes of golf without unbearable pain.  Dr. is taking me off for two weeks and then I'll try another drug.  If you are having problems, call your Oncologist and try another drug therapy.",1
I have been on this medicine for 9 months and my only complaint is the hot flashes.  They are worse now than when I went through menopause.,4
"I started in May 2010 with Arimadex, I became violently sick with vomiting, joint pain, etc.  Then the doctor put me on Aromasin, took it for 5 months and began same symptoms.  Started Tomaxafin for one month, became exhausted, joint pain and vomiting.  Decided quality of life is more important to me.  I have chosen not to take any drugs and have discussed this with my doctor and am due for further discussion end of July.",1
"BC in 2005, mastectomy, chemo, radiation and 5 years Tamoxifen.  Six months on Arimidex and can't stand the pain in hands, feet, feel like I'm 100 years old! Quality of life has to be better without this drug.",5
"I have taken Arimidex for a little over 4 yrs. Prescribed in '07 after left breast removal. Had 1 yr of chemo and 7 weeks of radiation. Cancer and removal of right breast in Dec '09. Another year of chemo and 7 weeks of radiation. All the while taking the Arimidex. I experienced every joint, back, leg, knee,neck, arm, feet, etc, pain you can imagine. I have hurt in places I did not know could hurt. Headaches, moodiness, unable to walk too far, stand or sit too long, many sleepless nights. Extended stomach (shaped like Santa Claus), no energy, tearful, just unable to be my old self. Regardless as to how much I try to explain all of the pains I have, I cannot describe the severity or the sudden strike of pain and general effect of this medication. But, I continued to take it. In a few days I will begin taking Aromasin. My doctor thinks this may help with side effects. We will see! But, if it does not, I wiil continue to take it, praying that God will work through the medication and keep the cancer away!",3
"I just finihsed 5 long years of Arimidex. The hot flashes and night sweats were the worst for me, even with Effexor I still had many per day, and they were unbearable! I had very little joint pain, but gained about 10 lbs, that I can't get rid of. I'm very glad to be done with this drug, and the good news is that I'm still cancer free. But, am wondering what side effects I should expect to experience for  a while, now that I have stopped it, just 4 days ago. I'm feeling very depressed right now, and don't know if this is normal. I was told that I didn't need to taper off, so I didn't, but the heat is still awful, and I really am not feeling well. I wonder how long it will still be in my system..... ",4
I would like to hear from anyone who was on this very painful drug - and stopped.  Do most women relapse?  Does anyone know the percentage of risk if this medication is stopped completely?,3
"I was diagnosed with early breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. I have been on Arimidex for approximatly seven months and it is horrible. I have joint pain in my feet and hands,Muscle aches,terrible nausea, dizziness,horrible hot flashes and sweating day and night.I cannot do things I used to do.Always feel sick, cannot sleep at night, cannot concentrate or think straight. Terrible side effects. I like others I read about will go off this medication and take my chances. I cannot live like this for five years.",1
"No Problems with side effects. I take it in the morning, after breakfast and before work. Took tamoxifen prior to arimidex, definitely prefer arimidex. No hot flashes, no joint pain no problem.",5
I have been on arimidex since 2003 for stage IIb breast cancer with any side effects.,5
"I have been taking Arimidex now for nearly two years. I had a mastectomy, with no chemotherapy or radiation treatment needed afterwards, for which I will always be grateful. My main problem with Arimidex is the constant struggle to remember names and events and loosing, my descriptive words at times, as I call it.  I find this very disturbing. Also moving quickly from being very positive to feeling negative and almost paranoid. I know that I did not have any of these problems before taking Arimidex. I have not so far experienced any real pain in any of my joints, but feeling like an old lady sometimes I can relate to. The memory thing however is my big worry. Why does this pill cause this problem does anyone know? Anyway take care everyone and laugh much, it really works. ",4
"After 2+ years the drug has done its job, but the side effects make me wonder if its worth it. Experience most of the usual side effects but the Vaginal dryness along with the painfull sex is Very disappointing. Hot flashes are getting worse. I feel like I am being De-Womanized...",5
"I have been on arimidex since 2005,i thought I would only be on it 5 years!  Now my doctor want s me to stay on it indefinitly.  I have alot of pain in my hands and feet, and terrible HOT flashs!!",4
"I was diagnosed in 2006 with IBC, had 8 chemo treatments, double mastectomy and 36 radiation treatments. Been on Arimidex for 5 years. I have sufered with many side effects. Currently am preparing for surgery to repair brittle broken bones in my back. Although I am to take the Arimedix another 5 years because of all the side effects I am stopping it as of now..",4
"By day two of taking arimidex, I had major headache, lung infection with product cough every minute day and night, back pain, muscle pain, EXTREME bone pain, joint pain, fever, with symptoms lasting several months.  RX for the lung infection.  Pain meds for lingering joint pain.  Subsequent xrays reveal this med has given me hip arthritis and I am in constant pain, having to restrict normal activity and sitting all day at my new office job is torture.  This medication should have prescreening for markers for severe reaction before letting people take it.  It has damaged my body.",1
"I have had severe reactions to this drug. My lymphedema worsened, carpal tunnel worsened, night sweats were severe, depression, confusion. I had a horrible time with my memory although I don't see memory loss as a side effect of this drug. I took Arimidex for about 2 months before I finally said no more. It has been 4 weeks since I stopped the Arimidex - all symptoms have either stopped or lessened substantially.  My oncologist is now prescribing tamoxifen but I haven't started it yet. Oh joy. ",2
"Wow - my mother and I both are on arimidex - me for about 4 months longer than her,  I've been on it going on 3 years and apparently like all the others - suffer many serious side effects - body aches and joint pain * stiffness, vision changes, all this and weight gain too! My mother is 78 and I'm almost 60 - we're both thinking about quitting.  The bottom line is do I want to live like this?  ",3
"I had a lumpectomy in 2000 w/radiation treatments and the cancer returned in 2009, resulting in a mastectomy.  I took chemo and have been taking Arimidex for going on two years.  I, like so many of the women who are on this drug, have been suffering from joint pain.  Just in the last week both my wrist have become very touchy and I've experienced extreme pain at times when trying to pick up an object or turning my hand.  I too, look as if I could be in my 90's when trying to get up from a chair or getting out of bed or the car.  I have told my oncologist but his reply is that the benefit of taking the medicine out-weighs the side effects.  I'm beginning to doubt . . . I know my age has some to do with my aches and pains but I truly believe this medication is limiting me.  I don't know if I can reach the five year mark feeling the pains and anxiety this medication seems to be causing.  I haven't read much from women who came off the Arimidex after giving it a year or two, and feeling it was the cause of some of their medical issues.  I wonder if one can stop and things will go back as they were or if we've created other problems by staying with it for so long.",1
I had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy before beginning the hormone blocking drug therapy in Jan 2010. So far the drug appears to be effective.  I was warned that side effects include weight gain and increased hot flashes.  Unfortunately I am experiencing both side effects.  I am taking more vitimins now including more D and E but I have experieced an increase in bone loss (to the extent that I now have full on oesteoporosis in my spine) and am looking at other therapies for that.  What is most disturbing is the weight gain.  I have fought weight gain since turning 50 but at 61 when I started the drug therapy I was able to manage that weight gain.  I can no longer due so and am very unhappy about that. Other suspicious side effects include one severe dizzy spell and pain in my foot though I do not have other noticiable joint pain.  I have increased my excercise to include daily walking which helps with overall mental health and to stave off depression.,4
I have taken Arimidex for 3 1/2 years and have very bad side effects.,3
Problems using Arimidex effected my Bowels and I've had to dis-continue using this medication....,1
"I have been taking Arimidex for 3 1/2 years, and have terrible side effects still ongoing.  My breat cancer was 0-1 stage, very early and smaller than a pea. Had a lumpectomy.",4
wonder if this drug will cause chemo brain?,3
"Gained about 25 pounds, only through painful diligence have I lost these. Shooting, burning pain in my hands, knees, hips, severe bone loss in my left hip. Told a hip replacement won't work for me, as my bones are too fragile. Going to quit this awful drug, two drs have told me it's either Arimidex or death, must be another option. Advance DCIS with 14 out of 24 nodes positive, largest tumor was 7 cm, smaller one was 4.5 cm, NOT FOUND ON MAMMO! Had a MRI to confirm tumor size and location. Dr has me taking mammo each year, still have dense breast tissue, going the Bio identical hormones route now.",3
"I was exhausted before I started taking this medication due to the cancer.  I do not notice any increased exhaustion.  I was hot all the time before I started it, and now have periods where I actually feel cool. Pains in bones I attribute to metastized breast cancer...take tylenol and try to get over it.  As long as this drug does it's job, I'm in for the long haul. No nausea, headaches, etc.  Look at the alternative, put it into perspective and persevere.",5
"Lumpectomy Feb 2009.  Started Arimidex (now generic) March 1, 2009.  Many side effects as everyone else but I find that it's getting worse instead of better.  I thought after being on it for a while pains would taper off or I would get used to it.  But not so - hair thinning is getting worse, getting more tired, feet and hands and legs hurt more, etc.  Will all this go away after 3 years when I'm finished with it?  I have almost 3 years to go. What will I be like after being on it for 5 years?  I'll not be able to get out of a chair at all.  But I'm afraid to stop, will continue to suffer and take the pill.  ",5
I have taken for 8 years only vaginial dryness is a side effect,5

Only hot flashes, tiredness, trouble sleeping, constant fatigue until late 2010, then bottom fell out. Since late Dec elevated cholestral (300+), surgery for trigger finger, pains right shoulder and arm. After Jan pains in right arm so bad could hardly move it, cholestral continues to rise, bad arthritus left thumb, 3 more trigger fingers, exercising and walking yet still constant fatigue. Quality of life is non-existant. Am calling oncologist and taking myself off this drug and take my chances.",4
"I was diagnosed in November 2008, stage II, node positive.  Had a double mastectomy, 16 rounds of chemo and 6 weeks of daily radiation.  Started taking Arimidex in July 2009, had a total hysterectomy in December 2009. I have experienced weight gain, joint pain, extreme fatigue, insomnia, fuzzy brain and can't remember a darn thing.

"I am a 15 year survivor of stage 4 breast to bone CA. I had radiation, chemo and a stem cell transplant. I have been CA free ever since. I've been on Arimidex since then and see my ONC every 3 months for blood tests,and am grateful to be pretty healthy. I'm on many drugs for other problems, so if I have side effects to this drug, it is hard to tell, but mostly I have joint pain that may be or not be just arthritis. Over all, it is great to be CA free and I have to give credit to this medicine and a healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude.",5
"Increasing amount of bone pain (hips, knees, ankles, hands) and total lack of strength. Hot flashes but less distressing and frequent than when on Tamoxifen. Starting to seriously question whether the impact on my comfort outweighs the benefits which of course remain unproven",2
"I have been using this drug for 4 years. Had breast cancer in 2007. had a lumpectomy and radiation every day for 7 weeks. I have had some hot flashes joint pain. A total of 6 triger fingers, 4 I had surgery to correct. the surgery was very succesful. Joint pain remains a problem. I have gained over 40#. Head aches pain in the right eye, When I told my Dr. I was thinking about stoping the medicin. He said if I did I would risk the return of cancer and the choice was mine to make. I have gone this long I will try to go 1 more year. I am so glad I am not the only one having these symtoms as I thought I was going nuts. ",5
"They should have named it ""ARIMIDEATH"" This is a horrible med and causes prolonged painful side effects. Would not give this to my worst enemy. Don't know why it is on the market, should be banned!!!",1
"Lumpectomy with radiation in June, 2009. Have been taking Arimidex since Sep 1, 2009. I was very positive about this treatment and trusted my Dr when she said the side effects were minimal. I am very active and walk every day as well as hiking and heavy gardening. My bone density was excellent! Shooting pains at night, feels like a bolt of lightening inside the bones of my legs. Wake up with these two or three times a night. Hot flashes, night sweats, depression, anxiety, inability to focus on tasks for long periods. Memory loss and confusion. Surgery on trigger finger last October. Didn't know it was caused by this until I started reading the posts here. Sex is excruciatingly painful. Now my foot is drawing up like my finger did. Cannot straighten three of the toes on my right foot. Very pronounced arch and is progressing very rapidly. Podiatrist says only fix is more surgery. Very painful as my toes rub the top of my shoes. Saw my Dr a week ago, liver enzymes extremely high. Have had same several times. Have had complete body scan, PT CT scan, sonogram and numerous blood tests. Also two more biopsies. Have gained about 25 lbs. Never had a weight problem before this. Headaches and some diarrhea. Carpal Tunnel. Slight acne. Hair is thinning. Cholesterol is high, but refuse to take statin drugs. Trying to keep it in line via diet. Last week after reading this site, talked to Dr. She said I would have to discontinue taking the drug. Have been off of it for 7 days, nothing has changed. Wonder how long it takes to get it out of my system. Hoping my body will return to normal. I'm really worried about not taking this, but can't imagine what kind of shape I will be in if I continue. The Dr says she has other patients who can't take it as well and just have to be very diligent with blood tests, exams & mammograms. Any slight variation will require further tests.  I also tried Aromasin, but the side effects were worse, after one month, went back to the Arimidex.",5
"SO FAR I HAVE NOT HAD ANY NOTABLE SIDE EFFECTS IT'S EASY TO TAKE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SMALL  PILL AS FAR AS EFFECTIVENESS, ONLY THE DOCTOR CAN DETERMINE THAT.",3
"I've been on Arimidex for 2 months for Stage II breast cancer , had surgery and chemo. Like all other reviewers I had all the side effects: Bone and muscle pain, hot/cold flashes, neuropathy, arthritis , fatigue,weakness, malaise, flu-like symptoms, depression, dizziness, insomnia, irritability. The last straw for me is the excrutiating pain in my hands especially at night. Carpal tunnel syndrome-like pain, only worse. I tried hot/cold packs and even wrist splints & NSAIDS, Exercise, yoga & meditation. They helped very little, I still wake up after 2 hours of sleep to excrutiating pain and never able to go back to sleep again. My Dr told me to stop it for two weeks and hallelujah the pain in my hands is gone. But he switched me to Femara, I will start next week, so wish me luck.",1
"I started taking arimidex almost 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 62. My left breast was removed as were 2 lymph nodes. I went through 6 chemo treatments and no radiation. I was keeping weight on, very tired, depressed and insomnia was ongoing.  Now, three years after,  I find that by eating better... I lost 20 pounds by sticking to low carbs, fruits and veggies, no ""white"" foods...rice, potatoes or breads, I find that by taking charge of myself, I'm feeling much better.  I used melatoin (5mg) every night for awhile but I find that by sticking to a walking program and some exercises, I feel much better and am sleeping without any aid recently. In February I had my annual mammogram on my other breast.  Because the film looked different than 2 years ago, I'm back thinking of cancer again.  So I may have to hold off on my arimidex findings until I'm retested in 2 months.  My surgeon says not to worry but you always have that nagging feeling in the back of your head. I do find that after my hair came back thicker after chemo that in the last 6 months, it seems to be thinning out.  I'm not sure what to attribute that to.  Thanks to all for sharing your experiences with your cancer. It sure helps to know that I'm not alone in this continuing journey.",5
"I was on femara-cost was outrageous and side effects were terrible for me as well. Switched to arimidex-Cost is better but side effects are worse.  Bones and joints hurt all the time, tired, can't sleep, water retention, weight gain, swelling.  I decided to stop taking this drug.  I, like some other reviews I have read, believe quality of life is better than a possible risk of re-occurence.",2
I am cancer free for almost five years.,4
"have been on arimidex for 7 months.slight hair loss, low sex drive ,no joint pain as yet, ",5
"does this medicine stay in the body, helping kill other cancers.  Example, ovarian cancer?  Original given for breast cancer",1
"Diagnosed with aggressive, rapid growing cancer; had chemo, wish I had radiation; was told chemo might not work with my cancer. Only on Arimidex less than a month. Starting to feel the joint pain, esp hands, muscle pain in legs quite bad. Yes, when I get up from a chair, I walk like I am 90. Want to share with others who are paying huge prices for Arimedex: Coscto charges $29.00 a month for 30 tablets, 1 mg. Yes, it is true. I cried happy tears when I found out. Walmart wanted $350 a month. If you don't have a Costco in your area, find one near you and ask if they will mail it; perhaps in 90 day supply. Or maybe a friend or relative lives near one and could mail it to you. You do not have to have a membership to get meds. Anyone can use their pharmacy for free. For all of you struggling with side effects: I have learned about an exciting new vaccine that is just in trial 1 that targets the cancer cells, kills them and has NO SIDE EFFECTS. I am going to find out where it is being offered. Don't give up. There is promising new treatment on the horizon. Have a positive attitude, stay active, and calm the mind; try meditation/ relaxation tapes. It really helps put me to sleep. I have placed my life in God's hands. It really helps my anxiety which is purposeless since it only stresses my body out. When I get down about the Arimidex side effects, I think of my mom and grandmother who did not have the good drugs and suffered a lot of pain. I try to think that by taking this medicine, I may be helping not only myself, but my grand-daughter and future generations who will learn from our taking this med. Hang in there, everyone.",4
"Since taking Arimidex I have had hot flashes, joint pain, weight gain, and memory loss. I fractured a rib by just bending over to pick something up off the floorboard of my car.  I walk like I am 90 years old and the mornings are the worse.  I have 2 1/2 more years on the medicine. My oncologist changed me to Femara but the pain in my knees and hips were worse than on the Arimidex so I switched back.",4
"The side effects of this drug are arm/shoulder joint pain, limited arm mobility, short term memory loss, some dizziness, severe mood swings accompanied by anger and missed sleep due to pain in arms while sleeping. Taking 20mg of Melatonin and 2 tablets of remeferin have improved sleeping patterns and eliminated the mood swings and on edge feeling.(NO more B%[email protected] husband is very happy about that) The arm mobility is another issue. Stretching/yoga, physical therapy are very helpful. Moving the body is so important! Have found alternative estrogen blockers but no studies to back them up.  Still searching.  Six months on this drug with one month break per my doctor to assess my symptoms to make sure they were drug related. That was affirmative. At this point it is what it is.  Working with a Naturopathic doc (who had breast cancer and knows first hand what we go through) has helped me tremendously.  ",1
"Some side effects. Minor joint pain I can live with.  No weght gain, no nausea, no hair loss and no HOT FLASHES!!  I take the med in the morning prior to leaving for work now. When I took the med at bed time, I had experienced occasional insomnia, and I woke up with stiff joints/muscles.  ",4
"I started taking this in August 2010 and like many of you am experiencing body aches and pain that is sometimes unbearable.  I have turned to Deep Tissue Massage and Hot Stone massages which helps tremendously.  The bad thing is yes the hot flashes are bad along with the body aches,severe pain in the joints and muscles,absolutly very  little sleep but I have only been on this for 6 months and God help me I have 4 1/2 years to go.  I know the best thing is no cancer again!!!!  But I am also experiencing Heart palps and dizziness and I don't feel like myself and I just want to feel somewhat normal again.  My pharmacist said to take Green Tea for the hot flashes and yes that helps they are definitely not as bad.  But has anyone else getting heart palps?",4
"The fear of breast cancer recurrence is a major impetus for following doctor's orders without hesitation when the promise of a drug cutting the chance almost in half is available. All drugs have side effects, some are intollerable, as was Arimidex in my case. Besides all of the side effects listed by most users, I experienced vertigo when I turned my head that made driving  dangerous and, already an insomniac, I virtually didn't sleep for the five months I was on the drug. The fear of recurrence was trumped by the ""quality of life"". Some of us will just have to take our chances.     ",1
"I have been on this drug almost 4yrs. As with many other ladies I have experienced joint pain in my hips and knees.  I also have noticed hair loss, insomnia and constipation. I was part of a clinical study group and will be taking arimidex for 5 yrs.  If it does the job it will be well worth some of the side effects.",4
I had breast cancer in both breasts.  Bilateral mastectomy.  Chemo. then radiation. My Dr. thought Arimidex was the best treatment for me.  I am now 6+ years cancer free.  Dr. was right Arimi9dex was best.,5
I took this med following finish of breast cancer treatment for three years.  I had no adverse side effects.  I've been cancer free for 11 years.,5
"the only thing that bothers me is the  sevear hot flushes,and the thinning of my hair",5
"Taking Arimidex 1.5 years now. Relief to know others experiencing same reactions. After sitting/driving for a while, so sore it feels like I can't move and need to stand for a few seconds before I can walk. My hands/legs/feet swell; the weight gain stinks-seems like I went from a size 10-14 overnight! Would love my sex drive and previous fun life back! But cancer free so far and hanging in there. Do hope these issues are not permanent after treatment! ",4
I have been on arimidex for 7 years.  The dizziness is getting worse along with muscle pain and stiffness. Exercising is a must. Hang in there-cancer free and loving life.,5
 I had a lumpectomy and was found to have one positive lymph node. My oncologist recommended radiation and then taking armidex for five years. I am healthy and have had no apparent ill effects from taking arimidex. ,5
"I am relieved to know I am not alone or nuts. I have such horrible aching in my knees and hips. I have had a total knee replacement years ago and even that knee (or lack of it) hurts. When I sit and get up it is just awful and it gets you so depressed to feel like this all the time. But, I keep going. I take 2 1000 mg. of cinnamon a day (2X) one am and one pm. I read that Japanese women used this for hot flashes. It has helped a lot. Originally I had about 10 flashes a day and now maybe 2 and they are not so severe. Cannot hurt to use it. I think the depression comes with feeling so crappy all the time. I thought of quitting, but figured I better stick it out. Don't want another bout of BC. Hope this helps someone and please try the cinnamon. Also, my onclogist told me that people who have trouble with paying for the Arimidex (even the generic is outrageous) can contact the manufacturer and they can cut you a deal and even free if you qualify. I am happy since I will be in the ""donut hole"" on Medicare next year in a few months. Pitiful that we have to even worry about money going through this. Good luck to all of you. ",5
"I have been on Arimidex for only 10 months.I have experienced mini hot flashes that are easing up now, moodiness that is managable because I know 'why',vaginal dryness,and muscle pain in my legs.My joints ache but I also have RA, I do have great fatique, but I also have CFS, so who knows what all is caused by the Arimidex and what all is from my other health issues.I will fight these side effects and continue the pill if at ALL possible. A pill that helps prevent further cancer, think about it......that is a God sent.I thank God I am here to take it! ",5
Arimidex has worked so far (going on 4 years)  The very bad part is that I have terrible side effects with this med.,5
I have been taking this medication for only 4 months.,5
"Mastectomy at 49 followed by chemotherapy 6 Month (I thought that was it).  Cancer returned at 62. The turmor was removed and followed by radiation treatment.  This followed by Arimidex.  I have been taking it for 5 years.  Some discomforts like hot flashes, body aches, etc. but these seem to have deminished as the years went by.  So far, it seems to be helping. One important factor I think is that I didn't and still don't dwell on the cancer and I never stopped working or doing things due to the cancer. Only family knew of my condition.  I wore a wig.  I also choose to not give it any excessive attention.  I do get a check-up once a year and a mammogram/ultra sound about every two years.  Life goes on.  The journey continues.",5
"Have been on Arimidex for almost 3 years and did not have some of the problems reported by others., When pain in my arm & shoulder developed for no apparent reason I stopped taking Arimidex for a little over one month. I then went back on it a few months ago but for the past week the pain (when I move) in my lower back, left hip and knee is unbearable. Not sure if it is the Arimidex, but as of today I'm not taking it.   Has anyone tolerated it for a long period of time, then believe the extreme pain is caused by the Arimidex?  I would appreciate any comments. ",3
Leg muscle pain is too intense and effecting my sleep.  Have to stop taking it.,3
"I have been taking this medication for about 18 months and experienced fatigue and joint pain in by arms, legs and back. I have also gained 35 pounds, but don't think I can blame the medication 100%.  When I am exercising on a regular basis, the aches do go away.",4
"Double mastectomy in 2009. Started on Arimidex, switched to Tamoxifen now back on Arimidex. Had to stop because of the cost. I found that the side effects were no worse than Tamoxefin. Now I have found Healthwarehouse, an online pharmacy in Ohio highly rated by the better business bureau. They specialize in generic drugs. I get 120pills for $76.00. Hot flashes are less than Tamox, bone pain and insomnia, but I can tolerate anything to keep cancer away.",5
"Have taken for 5 years.  Oncologist suggests going off drug but gave me the choice to continue until new data is available that suggests whether taking for a longer term than 5 years is beneficial. I have tolerated Arimidex pretty well.  Weight lifting has helped with the body aches.  Effexor really really helps the hot flashes.  My cholesteral went up along with my weight and my libido is gone.  Should I go off the drug now or wait?  Have the negatives been corrected once women go off the drug i.e. weight loss, improved sex drive and non-aching joints?",5
"I appreciate all the input here...maybe I am not crazy after all.  I had lumpectomy, chemo, mastectomy (bi-lateral) and radiation.  I just went through a bunch of pricey tests to try to find out why liver enzymes up, I wish I had read these comments first, I think the drug is to blame for me feeling like I am ninety. Sore bones, achey joints, at times quite sad and depressed..I am not sure gaining an extra year or two is worth living the next five years in such a state. Sex is out of the question..am sick of being sick.  I am wondering if anyone knows what the percentages are with regard to reoccurance if medication is stopped.  Hang in there everyone, this too shall pass...(hopefully sooner than later)!!!",3
"Since having partial mastectomy and mammosite radiation in April, 2010, I have been taking Arimidex.  (I'm thankful it is now available as a generic!) I am having a lot of joint pain, feet burning, and especially numbness/tingling/swelling/trigger finger in both hands.  I am grouchy, at times, and can't seem to stop it.  And, like so many others, I am tired.  I appreciate reading reviews that others have written - it helps me to know that I am not just imagining/whining about all these problems.  These are side effects of the medication that is supposed to be helping me. Five years is a goal I may not be able to reach, but I plan to give it my best shot.  Thanks for sharing your experience with Arimidex.  It was helpful to me.",5
"Altho I have trigger finger and numbness in fingers and toes, I had this before starting on arimidex. I haven't had any other side effects after 4 months of use. I wonder if some of the side effects reported are just the effects of arthritis and aging.",4
"Thanks for these postings. During my 1st year I did not understand what was going on with my body/mind. Severe bone & muscle pain, hot flashes almost unbearable at times and the memory loss was very scary. Once I read these postings, I made up my mind to fight these symptoms just like the breast cancer. I am almost at the 5 year mark (thank you Lord) I started running and lost 18 lbs. I feel better when I stay active. I still hurt a lot, feel very tired, memory often is terrible, and started losing hair. But I am looking forward to finishing in 4 months. ",5
I have taken for 18 months.  The greatest chalenge has the hot flashes and the vaginal dryness.  ,4
"Severe pain, hands, legs and feet",1
"I have been on this drug for 17 months. I have hard a lot of pain in almost all jonts. Trouble sleeping,terrible pain with sex, no sex drive. When I get up in the morning or set for more than 2 hrs I walk like I'm 90 years old.Tired most of the time with or with out sleep.",5
"Started a year and a half ago. I am only 49 now but felt like 90. Really bad joint and muscle pain, esp around hip area, bad flashes, dryness. Everything kind of toned down after a while and with Effexor was doing pretty good. Now the generic is out which is a fraction of the cost and is supposed to be the exact thing. Well it is not. I have had all the symptoms return and then some. Headache, more fatigue, depression, and can hardly walk sometimes. I am very active-dance, ride a bike, walk the dog. I am miserable and not that glad to be alive, because I don't have the energy to enjoy it. I am going to switch to Tamoxifen and if that doesn't improve things then I am rolling the dice.",4
"joint and muscle pain which has caused me to be very selective on what i do, as i also have arthritis.Doctor has changed me to aromasin and have not started it yet ",2

"I am 52 years old.  I checked the 5 stars for effectiveness because I am hoping and praying that this medicine is working.  I had a mastectomy in 2009 and took the Tamoxifin first, switched to Femera, and now Arimidex.  I have been on the Arimidex for about 6 months and the side effects are no better than the Femara.  I am stiff and sore most of the time, had the weight gain, but the worst of the side effects for me is the memory loss.  They call it ""chemo brain"".  It effects my everyday life, my job, etc.  I am thankful to have read everyone's responses though.  It lets you know that you are not alone.  ",5

However, I started going to the gym and walking the treadmill and lifting wieghts and now I'm pain free and walking with a real spring in my step. Still feel REALY tired though!",5
"Just started taking Arimidex last night for the first time. I have read all the reviews and feel sorry for the women who are suffering while taking this medication. It is really to soon for me to say what this  med will do to me. only time will tell. Have kept a positive attitude through all my tx's, just hope I can keep going. I feel older than I used to, before chemo-radiation and now these pills. I am 52.",1

Started Arimidex in Dec 2007, have just starting having the numbness in one hand and then my feet, hot flashes, joint pain (mainly ankle) very stiff, will get through this, glad to know that others have the numbness that was really begin to worry me.  Maybe this will help find a cure and our grandchildren will not have to worry about this awful disease.",4

I have experienced numbness on the left side of my body.,1
"Was glad to find this site, I thought maybe I was losing my mind on this Arimidex. Weight gain, headaches, legs hurt and even breast pain now. I have seriously thought about telling my doctor I don't want to take it anymore. Been a year now, I just hate it. They make it sound like if you dont take it the breast cancer for sure will return.

"First dx in 1982 treated with mastectomy,small tumor, no chemo or radiation.  Came back in liver and on surface of lung in 2008.  Have been on Arimidex since 4/2008 with excellent results, but side effects have been awful--extreme hot flashes responded to Effexor but didn't like sexual side effects.  Now sex is very painful.  Sore knees.  Psychologist says drug makes anti-depressant less effective. Am very emotional and short tempered.  Feel awful most of the time, but probably not as awful as chemo.  Not sleeping more than 1 or 2 good nights a month.  Many nights no sleep or wake up and can't get back to sleep.  Catepres patch helps with hot flashes but may need higher dose since blood pressure has also gotten quite high.  Now bones are thinning so doing lots of walking and weight training in addition to water aerobics and osteoporosis class.  Tumors are nearly gone, and I'm still hoping for NED.",5
"They changed my script to generic I have to crush to take or it doesn't disolve in my body. My legs weren't hurting I was feeling better than I had in a while until I discovered why. I have been taking this since mid Nov 2009. So I can't tell how it will do for me.  My hair still doesn't seem like it wants to come back.  My doctor said it was the second half of my chemo, so Ive been preparing for side effects.  I take pain meds for other conditions which helps with the leg pain(bone pain). I'm also having brain issues which I guess is expected from the cancer treatments.  I still have a long way to go with this treatment. ",5
"joint pain, ankles and back only 8 months left out of the five years. i am 62, so far it has worked well really can't wait til i get the all clear sign.",4

"I started Arimidex in April 2009.  After about 6 months I started getting extreme pain in my right shoulder joint; then the right knee and occasionally the right elbow.  My cholesterol has jumped as well by a lot and am now trying statins and Niacin.  The ldl has gone from 130 - 178, however the hdl has also gone up.  I am switching to Femara, so we'll see.",4
"Age 66, diagnosed one year ago July 6, had lumpectomy, then radiation daily for 7 weeks, no chemo reqd due to OncoType DX test results of 5%.  Started Armidex in October 2009.  Immediate joint aches, and now 8 months into the daily dosage my right thumb locked and three months later have  trigger finger on the same hand.  Last month, when the left thumb also started hurting, the oncologist switched me to Aromasin,the left thumb is better but the right hand thumb and finger are pretty much useless. Not certain how to face another four years of these estrogen blocker medicines.   Know that I have tendosis causing the thumb and finger pain, but evidently local steriods are the only solution.  Am icing my arm to try and reduce swelling in the tendons, and taking ibuprofen often.... Have an appt in a couple of weeks with the oncologist and will probably try the third, and as I understand it, the last choice this type of medication.   Evidently the female body needs estrogen to allow everything to work properly, without it, complications arise that you never dreamed of.  After reading some of the posts, just confirms what I suspected that that tiny pill Armidex is potent stuff.",4
"Stage 3 breast cancer, postitive nodes Her2 +, Estrogen+. Chemotherapy followed by 5 weeks radiation, 18 Heceptin treatments.  I was 45 when first diagnoised.  Chemo induced menopause.  Took Tamoxifen for 1 and half years prior to having hysterectomy.  Side effects of Tamoxifen very similiar to Arimidex.  Hot Flashes, joint pain, thinning hair(Arimidex), dizziness, trouble sleeping.  I have a Hypo thyroid, taking Arimidex has lowered my thyroid levels.  I had been on the same medication for my thyroid for years without any fluctuation in levels.  Overall I will just put up with Arimidex and all the effects because the alternative of cancer returning is not what I want.  48 years old now and 2 years post surgery.",4
"I have been on Arimidex since November 2007 after lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. My tumour was grade 3. So far no metastases (fingers crossed).  I did experience frozen and very painful joints after taking it for a month, I felt like an old woman, I could hardly get up from my chair. I searched on Google and I read somewhere that this drug depletes your body from vitamin D (already low in many women with breast cancer) and that Vitamin D could stop the painful side effects. I got a blood test for vitamin D levels and sure enough it was very low. After I talked with my oncologist and we decided to try a high dose of vitamin D. I took 2000 U a day for a few months, which cleared the symptoms and got my vit D blood levels up, now I am on 1000 U a day and doing great. Thought I'd pass on my experience so somebody else can benefit from it.",4
"I went on Arimidex after first trying Femara.  Although the joint pain was not as severe on Arimidex, it was still very strong. At age 49, after using these 2 drugs, I was diagnosed with severe artheritis in my spine.  I didn't have as much numbness in the hands as I did with Femara, but still quality of life issues as well as being able to continue with my job (armed forces) came into play.  I was stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma with not lymph node activity as well as oncotype tested with a score of 6, so I decided the odds were in my favor and my doctor and I decided to put me back on tamoxifen even though I am now post-menepausal.  I feel much better on tamoxifen, and have actually been able to loose a few pounds in the short time I've been on it.  I still have some joint pain but it has only been a week since I've been off Arimidex, so I have high hopes to start feeling closer to 50 soon, instead of 90.",3

Drs. or maybe we are still learning.Both of my thumbs now stick and I have knots in the fat part of the hand,hard like a rock.(termed Trigger finger)also on bottom of feet. My biggest scare is the breast that took radiation it hurst like it may fall off. If I stop taking the Arimidex the pain stops.Pain so bad no one can touch that breast. My liver enzemes were elevated so they went down with scope and found 2 strictures but couldn't go thur to small.We are still working on this.Need to mention my cholesteral is so high 285 but I cannot take a statin with these issues.The sweating and hot flashes and soar throat and weight gain are way down on the list,so if my liver can make it 2 more years and no cancer I guess this is an effective drug. Bottom line if you think you have a symtom thats new to you it is not in your head,I repeat it's not in your head.",4
"Had breast cancer in 1992 and again in 2007.Each time I had a mastectomy. No further treatment in 1992, but chemo in 2007. I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 1/2 years. Have had hot flashes,burning feet, memory loss,alot of weight gain, with elevated triglyderides and cholestral,with no success of bringing down.  Now for the past 5 months, my hands have become numb and tingly and this really bothers me, because it never lets up. Not sure if it is the arimidex or not. Will be getting checked out with a nuerologist this next month, so we will see.  Had a tumor removed from my spine in Jan. at the T4-T5 area but it did not affect my hands, so my surgeon in referring me.  If they do not find anything wrong with the nerves,I will have to decide on whether or not to continue with this medicine.  Was advised to acupucture for the hot flashes. Never had come across anyone having trouble with numbing of hands, or reading about this side effect until the other day when by GP told me this was a possible side affect. So I started exploring the internet once again. God bless you all and may we all remain cancer free!",5
"I have been taking Arimidex for 3 years.  The tumor in my breast shrunk dramatically, although lately seems to have increased a small amount.  Tumor in my rib has remained unchanged.  I have no side effects.",4
"been taking 1-1/2 years.  Many hot flashes in the beginning but, has gotten better.  Joint pain just started couple of months ago.  2 years post breast cancer surgery.",4
I have experienced a LOT of joint and bone pain. I also am stiff first thing in the morning or after not moving for short periods of time. Pain has become unacceptable and am going to ask oncologist to try my on a different drug.,1
"I ahve been on Arimidex for a little under a month now.  The side-effects are unbearable at times.  The worst being that I have become Nocturnal.  I am also experiencing Excruciating Back and Joint Pain.  Thank God for heat pads. Less not forget the drepressing also being in the top ten also.  Hot flashes, Sleeplessness, Bask and Joint pain.  I will endure all this in order to remain CANCER FREE.  God Bless you all. And may this Disease be cured one day.",2
"Glad to hear the side-effects I am experiencing are common with many others.  Don't like them (especially the weight gain) but don't like the alternative.  Been on Arimidex for 4 months.  Know I have a ways to go but willing to give it a try.  Going to keep active, eat healthier and stay positive.  Good luck to all and God Bless.",4
i get sores on my body that take forever to heal,5
"As I'm typing this my hands and fingers hurt and are so stiff I can barely type.  Was put on Arimidex for 4 months before I finally told my oncologist-enough! Pain in feet so bad I can barely stand or walk, pain in both knees makes it difficult to walk up and down stairs, pain in both shoulders, memory so bad it frightens me. Oncologist tried to pass it off as ""Oh, sounds like you have rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sending you to a Rheumatologist"", to which I replied, ""No, you're not, this is a side effect of Arimidex, it's chemical not phsiological"".  Just what I need, another doctor appt. NOT!!!!!!! Glad I found these posting which helped me understand where all this pain came from so quickly.  My history...age 50-diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma with bone mets, 1 lumpectomy, 3 lymph nodes removed, all cancerous.... one year later... mastectomy, 19 more lymph nodes removed-all cancerous, breast reconstruction with implant, 5 weeks of radiation.  So.....for me, quality of life at this point is important.  I still work a full time job which is physically demanding, used to be very athletic, have gained 25 lbs. in short period of time. Doctor took me off Arimidex, put me on Aromisin for two weeks, no improvement of pain, then back on Tamoxifen. I liked the posting of the women who said she was 52 (my age) but felt 92!!!! Amen!! I think they need to go back to the drawing board and try again.",3
I have been taking arimidex since March and so far it has been working well for me. I have some anxiety and depression but so far no hot flashes or joint pain.,5
"I hate the hot flashes i have from this, reminds me of going through the change of life, thought i would never have that again.",4
"I have been taking Arimidex for 5 day. I have muscle,joint pain and stiffness plus my back feel like a mule kicked me in it. The first night I experienced nausea and vomitting. For a minute I thought I was back on Chemo. I am also started having vaginal bleeding which has me worried.I will continue to monitored by the Doctors and Pray that this BEAST leaves me alone.  Let us continue to Pray to GOD for each other.  Good Luck.",2
taking drug for 4 wks.always had stomach problems..they just got worst.the runs and neausea..anyone else?,3
"I am 51 and hurt all over. Mostly in my knees and back. Hot flashes, but they can be fixed with a fan. My biggest problem is the fatigue.  Can't sleep at night which doesn't help with the fatigue. Lost my libido and want it back. Fell one day and ended up breaking my leg in five places. I sure hope that all of this is worth it. Depression and mood swings are a huge problem for me. I want the old me back again!",3
"relatively few side-effects; hot-flashes the most frequent and most annoying, but able to LIVE with; secondly the muscle-joint pain but again, able to LIVE with. One year post diagnosis and no recurrence.",4
After just 2 months the blood cancer count has decreased from 250 to 98. ,5
"I have been on Arimidex for three years and currently remain cancer free. Every three or four months I experience a day when every part of my body aches, even my hair and scalp. I had arthritis in my back and hip before treatment, and it does hurt more now, but I use hydrocodone for pain management a few days a week, totalling maybe six tablets durning my evening job where I am required to stand for four to six hours at a time. I do have trouble getting a good nights rest because of the hip pain, which has moved into both hips. But, I know there are other treatments that could be far worse to deal with, and I prefer to remain alive. When first diagnosed with breast cancer I chose not to let it be what defined me and I took an active hand in deciding my forms of treatment, which included brachy therapy radition instead of being trapped into six weeks of it. I took a short two week vacation and stayed with my daughter and her family, riding to work with her husband and he would drop me off for the treatments (2 half hours a day, four-six hours apart). I finished the treatment the day before my 51st birthday. I will survive the pain and I appreciate what Arimidex is doing for my otherwise estrogen-happy producing body. I plan on a long active life, pain or not.",5
"I started on this drug after my hysterectomy. Was on it for 2 weeks when the bone/joint pain started. At 3 weeks I started having blurry vision. Called my oncologist at 4 weeks to be switched to something else. Started on Femera today, hope it doesn't have the same side effects. ",4
"I have been taking Arimidex for a year now and have experienced only joint pain in my hands, some carpal tunnel syndrome-like symptoms and pain in knees when I sit too long and get up. Similar to other complaints, but otherwise I have no side effects and remain cancer-free.",4
"After taking Arimidex for the past 6 months, the only real complaint I have is terrible lower back pain, and some hip pain, especially in the early a.m.  I can hardly stand up straight when I get out of the bed.  I take the dog and walk for 45 mins. every day, which helps somewhat.  Midmorning I go swim for 45 mins., and this helps a lot.  I'm not getting used to the pain at all, and don't know how I will make it for the full 5 yrs.  Meanwhile, I take calcium and omega-3 fish oil supplements daily, along with a multi.  I also drink one tablespoon of Noni Juice every day.  Thanks for all the input, as it is very helpful.",4

"I have gone thru chemo, masectomy and radiation. At  first it made my bone hurt, but not enough to have my doctor change my medication. I was diagnosed in April 2008, and started taking this medication Dec 2008, My medical examins came back all negative in May 2009 Thank God ! I have had 2 other set of tests and I'm doing great",5

I have expierenced weight gain,nausea,loss of appetite, headaches,lack of energy,severe muscle pain,pain in legs and shoulders, headaches,hot flashes,odd cough, unable to sleep thru the night, red rash on upper chest. Afer sitting for more than an hour it is very diffucult to get up and get going. Before all of my surgeries I was a very active person and not I am too sore and tired to get up and go.",3

"January 1995 at age 44 I had a complete hysterectomy and put on hormone replacement pills.  October 2005 blood was detected in my stool.  Colonoscopy revealed a bad spot in my colon.  Surgery was performed.  When the doctor opened me up I was FULL of cancer. The biggest tumors were removed along with some intestines.  It was determined it orginated as uterine cancer and the hormone replacements fed the cancer.  It was so tiny it went undetected.  I have been on Arimidex since December 2005.  February 2010 my latest CT Scan showed NO MORE CANCER!  Yea for Arimidex - it ""starved"" the cancer into disappearance! I have not had any side effects from Arimidex that I have noticed.",5

Side effects include weight gain, joint pain, terrible hot flashes, fatigue...bottom line, I feel horrible.  I was a very active 44 year old - 5 days a week in the gym after work.  Today I am lucky to make it through my day.  I will be talking with my Dr in May to discuss the need for the med.  I can't imagine another 4 years of this.",1
"I have almost completed five years on Arimidex and have had almost no side effects. I have had a few mild hot flashes & also some joint pain but no more than I had before from arthritis. I was 79 years old when first diagnosed with breast cancer & had a lumpectomy followed by radiation. So far (my fingers are crossed) I have had good reports from my oncologist. Perhaps some of the occasional lack of pep that I have been attributing to old age is due to the Arimidex, but I have continued active both physically & mentally and am grateful for the good health I've enjoyed for five years.",4
"i've experienced lots of hand pain,trigger finger in my both thumbs, my right thumb i can't even bend it any more and its very pain full.i stopped taking it after a year and  half.i also gainedwight while taking this medicine. it was then changed to aromasin and it did the same exact thing.",1
"Stage 2 cancer in 2003, chemo.  I just came to end of taking Arimidex for 5 years.  It was easy to take, but my side effects were: progressing hair loss (this worried me the most), joint aches, bone scan showed some bone loss in spine, however extra calcium, vit. D and walking have helped reading come back up.  Next scan showed some gain in bone.  I would get stiff if sitting too long, had to take a minute to get going again.  No pain after I started moving around.  I did experience very dry mouth the past 2 years (mostly at night). Stick with it if you can, I hope it saved my life.  Good luck to you all.  ",4
great number of hot flashes. ostopenia. joint pain.,5
joint pain,5
"My first cancer was in 1999 and after a mastectomy I started Tomaxifin with little side effects.  In 2003 the cancer returned on same breast and 8 weeks of radiation I started taing Arimidex.  After 5 years from 2003, my oncologist said he wanted me on Arimidex for an additional 5 years.  Yes, I have weight gain, hair loss, joint pain, loss of sleep, but no cancer.  I can live with the side effects if it stops the cancer from returning.  Exercise, gardening and walking all help.  Also, think positive and pray.",5

Positive person, not a whiner, keep on doing what I want, but positive also this drug is tough. Every part of my body hurts, breast pain, very little sleep, total fatigue, increasing arthritis & all-over stiffness. Tests last mo. indicate fatty liver, osteopenia, low blood counts, gall bladder acting up.  Think I will go to the 2 yr. mark in May and ask to finish up with Tamoxifen through Dec. for my 5 yrs.  Quality of life is diminishing and side effects are increasing. Am I risking total health with this? Can't even imagine 10 or more years on this drug for anyone! I'm consulting w/my gp and praying to make the right decision. (PS: Not that it's the most important consideration, but this precrip. just went to $505.per month from 360 last year!) I love my life and I pray for all of us on this journey.  Good luck and God bless!",4

"I have been on arimidex for 9 months.  I am 40 years old and feel like 80.  My hair is falling out, my fingers and thumbs ache, my joint pain is bad enough to make me limp, I have gained 10 pounds and never had issues with weight before, I have lost my labedo and suddenly dislike everything about me.  I have always been happy with who I am and now I fight to see the good.  I am afraid to quit as I do not want cancer recurrence, but then I wonder what kind of life am I going to have!?!  Fat, bald and single?  How much can my husband and children really take?  What a bad situation!",3
"I have only been on Arimidex for 1 week. Already suffering pain in hip joints, loss of concentration and memory, dizziness and insomia with hot flushes. I am also very nauseated which I did not read in any of the reviews. Has anyone felt nauseated along with all the other symptons?",1
"Can't think well,Joint and muscle pain, hot flashes, memory loss, anxiety, insomnia, hair loss, weight gain..have it all. I hate the way I feel so I went off for 3 months, then became afraid the cancer would return I resumed.  Most symptoms had subsided, when I stopped, but now that I have resumed, they are back with a vengance. Next testing is June 1st, and I am going to ask Oncologist if there is any alternative, or I'm going to stop. This is not a good quality of life, with no guarantee it will prevent a reoccurrance or not leave me with other unacceptable problems from the side effects. ",2
"The pain issues are getting to much for me. What would happen if I quit this drug?  I cant move my arms, difficulty driving, loosing feeling in my hands.  If anyone wishes to discuss this, feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]net  Subject: breast cancer.  Any ideas on what to take for pain?  I have tried vicoden, skelaxin, norco, nothing works.

"I have been taking Arimidex for about 18 mo. after right breast removal, 6 mo. of chemo ( heavy duty)  and 2 mo. of radiation. Have all the side effects mentioned, except problems with bowl movement. Does it any good, who knows? Only time will tell! My biggest problem I have is the constant aches and pains and loss of energy I amtired all the time. Also noticed short term memory loss,dizziness being a big factor  also and sometimes I have a speech problem. Can't finish what I want to say and my words come out blurry? Does any one else have that problem? But than looking at the bright side, I am alive and try to make the best of every day and look forward to tomorrow.",3
"I find it debilitating. I was once very active and now suffer from severe bone and muscle pain in my arms and hands.   What really bothers me is that people feel that I should be count my blessings (I do) Yet, they complain about having a tooth ache.

Sometimes the pain imobilizes me. I really want to quit this drug, but it is working.  Sometimes I wonder if it is worth it (the pain issues)  But, yes it is, as long as it works.

"Started taking Arimidex 5 months ago for metastatic breast cancer in both lungs. I have experienced muscle cramps in arms and legs, anxiety, brain fog, inability to consontrate and general body weakness.I was blaming my symptoms on my chemo now I know it is the Arimidex.My skin has aged at least 10 years and my hair is thinning. I'm seeing my oncologist on Wednesday to see if the benefits out weight all these symptoms.",4
I am having a problem with dry mouth and cracked lips.  Very uncomfortable.  Will call for a possible (hopefully) remedy.,5
occ. joint pains,4
"I've been on Arimidex for 17 months and have most of the side effects - terrible joint & bone pain, hot flashes like I can't describe, sleep problems, fatigue, hair thinning. . . I guess it's working because the cancer hasn't come back. Because of the side effects my oncologist is taking me off of Arimidex for a couple of months and substituting Femara. He's tried several times before but I wouldn't go along with it (don't want the cancer to return) now I'm tired of the side effects so I'm willing. I won't go without my anti cancer drugs - no matter the side effects.",5
"Let's start with the positive - cancer hasn't come back so far. Tumor markers are increasing but they can't figure out why because PET scans come back fine. As for the negative, I have had surgery on both thumbs for trigger finger. The pain in my joints is getting worse daily. I have been on Arimedex for 2 years now. Vomiting, naseau, memory loss, blurry vision, etc.. Practically all the symptoms I have read on here. I don't know how much of this is due to the medication and how much is due to aging. Either way, I'd rather be cancer free, so as long as it is working I will continue taking it and hope the long term effects don't turn out to be worse than the original problem. Good luck everyone.",4

The side-effects that I suffered from Arimidex were fatigue, headaches, aches in my knees and memory loss/fuzziness.  Unfortunately, another cancerous tumor was found and I'm waiting for test results to see what medication and chemo will be prescribed.  Your remarks were very useful to me because I hadn't realized that it was Arimidex's fault for my symptoms and I generally blamed the chemo (after so many years!).

I USED to have a sunny disposition! Been on the Arimidex for a year now, and have also had dizziness, hot flashes, headaches.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation, no spread to lymph nodes, thank God. I guess I will have to deal with this for 4 more years...hope my family can put up with me!  I try, but this sure has affected my moods..my husband says the changes started soon after I began the Arimidex, and that is what I thought.  I will be very glad to have these 5 years pass fast.

One I have not seen in the reviews is diarreah, which I experience at least 3 times per week, usually beginning between 2:30 & 4:00 a.m.  I take Arimidex usually between 6:00 & 8:00 p.m.  This is a major problem for me.  Are there foods that react to the drug or does it make any difference.  I cannot find any consistency, except when I eat fried chicken.  ",5
"Sorry that we can't rate this drug, but from all of the user's comments, we are wondering if our mother who is 82 should even start this drug. She has had extreme weight loss and at this stage in her life, is all of the side effects worth it? Will this improve her quality of life? Any comments would be appreciated. ",1
"I am 66 yr old female and in May 2009 I had a grade 2 lobular carcinoma removed with lumpectomy. Starting in Sept I was treated with 6 weeks radiation therapy. I was supposed to take Arimidex for 3 months as part of a clinical trial. After exactly four weeks I chose to stop because of side effects. After less than 2 weeks on Arimidex joint pain started to develop. I had pain in my feet, hips, lumbar spine, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hands. My rheumatologist and radiation oncologist agreed that Arimidex was the cause. I now have an acute flare of fibromyalgia as a result of the stress of the joint pain. With hindsight I would not have taken the Arimidex. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1996.",2
I have had no problems with taking this medication.,5
I have been taking arimidex for about 8 mo. I am having a lot of pain in back and groin. Also tired and no sex drive. Hair is thinning. I am glad to be alive but what a way to live. Also memory is not like it used to be.,3
"1. Cancer has not come back 2. Very difficult sex life...dry, painful 3. Foot and Hand joints ache in am 4. Hot flashes under control with Effexor and Fan with remote! 5. Noticible memory loss and ADD 6. Lots of exercise, busy job and social - add in Calcium, Vit D and a multi. 7. Glad to be alive and a year and a half away from getting off these drugs.",5
"I am 63 and feel like I'm 100. I have been taking arimidex for 14 months & know that others are having all these side effects too.  Yes - I am thankful to be alive!  BUT is there a fine line between longevity and quality? I'm trying to decide.  My bones, joints, & muscle aches are horrible.  I can barely move when I stand up, stairs are almost impossible.  I quit the arimidex a week ago and can walk alot better.  I started it again today.  I can't decide what to do.  (The researchers have to find something more tolerable.)  This is besides the mega-hot flashes, constipation, trigger thumb, brain fog , weight gain, depression from the constant pain, poor sleep, dry mouth, and the list continues.  The bone & joint pain came on more slowly but is getting continually worse.  I don't think I can do this for 4 more years....The positive note is that I just finished reconstruction - I highly redommend it - I feel whole again.  Give me some advice on this arimidex thing....     ",3
"bone density appears to be affected, tho' no baseline ever done; stiff joints and muscles despite active exercise; extreme vaginal dryness; weight gain despite exercise--closing in on 5th year and hope to end treatment--docs used to recommend 5 years, now some say 6! anyone know anything about this?  I want to live, yet quality of life is essential.thanks! Survivor of stage 2B,estrogen-receptive",5
"Been on this drug for 18 mos now.  The beginning saw anxiety/depression, muscle aches & joint pain.  Last 3 mos have started experiencing carpel tunnel & more muscle strain that has greatly limited ability to exercise.  Any suggestions?",5
"I have been on this drug for 4 months and absolutely hate it.  All of my joints ache, very dry mouth, numbness in my thumb and finger tips, weight gain, etc..  I am 65 yrs. old, active, a weight lifter for the last 9 yrs., walk and am physically active at my part time job.  Now, I have to force myself to get past the pain while in the gym, I can hardly stand to walk up stairs, and when I get up from a sitting position I feel like I have the knees of a 90 year old. My doctor wants me to stay on this drug until March and if things don't improve I will be put on aromasin.  I know I could not stay on Arimidex for 5 years and continue to feel this crappy.",2
"stage 1a--t2n0m0--3 years ago. modified radical masectomy left breast. drug caused hot flashes(can empathise with the ladies!!),now mostly gone. have fatigue,not sure if drug causes this fully.sometimes hands become tingly and hip joint throbs,otherwise after 3 years of indulgence seems ok. will have every one afflicted with this terrible disease in my prayers!! HANG IN THERE!! 3 years disease free and fingers crossed!  Thank You.",5
I have been taking Arimidex for 2 1/2 years  so i feel fine. Don't have any side affect.  I have 2 i/2 years to go. This is my second  go around with breast cancer. I hope this is the last time. I am over 65 and active arimidex hasn't slow me down. I hope it help's you the when it has me.,5
Achey joints in hands and feet. Triglyceride levels tripled in 3 months. Hot flashes - not too bad.,3
"I'm 52 stage 1 IDC post lumpectomy and radiation.taking arimidex for 3 weeks and experienced side effects within 3 days of starting this med.scratchy throat,fatigue,joint pain,trouble sleeping, hot flashes and vaginal dryness. saw the oncologist and he says i'm anemic,(i'm tired of being tired). told to stop arimidex for 2 weeks then start aromisin.  i researched that drug and it looks worse than the arimidex.  my breast is sore.  my husband has been great.  with the holidays here he hates to shop but has taken me shopping whenever i have the energy.told the kids they cn bake their own cookies this year.life has to get better.i want MY life back the one i had without cancer!",2
"I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma almost five years ago. After a masectomy, I had 8 chemo treatments and a one year regimen of Herceptin IVs. I have been taking Arimidex for 4 years. There are times when I feel like my bones will break and I get very stiff when I sit for a while. I sometimes have to push myself to keep going, but that is what we survivors do--we keep fighting and going forward. I find that sitting in a hot tub of water relieves some of the pain, but I can not get out of the tub without assistance. Vaginal dryness is a problem as well. For some time, I thought these symptons were the after effects of the chemo and herceptin. I appreciate all the comments posted. This makes me realize that I am not alone in my experience. If this drug keeps my cancer from coming back, then I guess I can take the pain. Keep smiling and moving forward!",4
What can I expect when I have finished 5 yrs. of Arimidex. Such as body effects. And how long will it take to get out of my system and I will have more energy.,5
"Have been on Arimidex for 4 yrs.  Have experienced joint pain, nueropathy of feet and hands, hot flashes, high cholesterol, weight gain and a variety of other issues.  Side effects seem to be increasing over time.  Difficult to deal with at times, but I don't want to stop for fear of the cancer returning.  ",4
    I want to thank all you of for taking the time to rate this drug- now I know I'm having the same side effects as all of you.  I really thought I had many medical problems that were unrelated and now I know they are all related to taking Arimidex. Have been on it for 13 months with joint stiffness and pain - especially in hands.  Have had surgery for thumb trigger and now have three other fingers starting to catch. Dr. put me on anti-inflamatory but it's not helping. Also burning itching feet and palms.Night sweats were so bad my GYN put me on Effextor.  Helped lots but it has its own side effects. Oncologist says thought is now Arimidex and similar drugs are effect in preventing return of cancer even after five years so I should plan to be on it longer.  Feel whinny when drug maybe preventing return of cancer but I surely do miss my life before Arimidex.     ,4
"I have had all the side effects a person could wish not to have.  The werst is the blesters on my genitals.. I took this med. in 03 to 05, the side effect are still there and I also have filromyelgis & chronic fatuge... I hated this medication, will never take it again.. Or other cancer medication",2
Having a lot of bone aching.  Terrible Hot flashes and over all aching and tired,2
"Was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer and had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation in 2007. I went on Arimidex(after Tamoxifen) in the Spring of 2008. Within approximately 6 months I began to feel a tingling and numbness in my hands and feet, particularly at night. This got much worse as time went on. I began calling this ""neuropathy"", as that described it almost perfectly. I began taking vitamins specifically geared toward helping nerves and started an exercise program that included daily walks. I am a bartender, so I am always on my feet, and stay in relatively good shape. Nothing seemed to help and then I was experiencing it day and night. I could barely walk when I got up in the morning. I'd have my good days and bad and was starting to wonder how long I could do my job! In the meantime my doctors were suggesting I may need to see a nuerologist. I misplaced my Arimidex on Memorial Weekend of 2009. Had no way of refilling prescription until the following Tuesday. Within 3 days OFF the Arimidex this crippling conditions was almost completely gone!! I contacted my Oncologist. Needless to say, I am off the Arimidex and now take Femara. I have at least learned that ""they"" don't know all the side effects of these drugs. We all may play an important role in that. I have now been on the Femara for 6 months, so far so good. Hurray for sites like this where we can share our experiences with and reactions to different drugs. THIS INFORMATION IS SO VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT! Thank you.",3
"Mary Connal asked whether anyone else had experienced itchy hands and feet.  Yes, I have and am glad to know that it was the Arimidex and not a shell fish reaction.  Actually had an Allergist do the skin tests to see if I was allergic to shell fish.  Nope, only 4 different pine trees.  I love shell fish so I'm happy to know it's only the Arimidex.  So far so good with this medication. Hot flashes and aches/pains...already had before starting the drug.  Have taken Fosomax for over 15 years.  No weight gain yet, but am exercising and walking each day.  Still facing an additional surgery for reconstruction.  Long story...pathology report was incorrect and I had a skin flap covering breast form implant removed.  Now we have to start over again.  My advice...get a second opinion if first pathology report comes back positive. I find an active daily schedule and positive attitude go along way to making the breast cancer diagnosis bearable.",5
"Diagnosed age 50 with stage 1 IDC, er/pr +, node neg. Bilat Mastectomy Jan 13, 2009. Started Zoladex (to put me into menopause) and Arimidex. Hit hard with hot flashes/sweats and bone pain. Know many women who have given it up in favor of quality of life, but not willing to gamble with my life. Symptoms being treated with Prozac, Ibuprofen, and Black Cohosh. Having fewer hot flashes (and sleeping better with Benedryl).  No personal evidence that Arimidex is keeping me cancer free. For now, will stick to the 5 year plan. ",5
"I was diagnoses with DCIS w/micro vascular invasion of 1mm/no lymphnode involvement and had a bilateral mastectomy.  I took Arimidex for 4 months and stopped taking it as I was no longer thriving.  I had joint and muscle pain especially the lower back and legs, major depression and brain function problems.  I was so ""foggy"" I would know what I wanted to do but was so confused I couldn't complete any thought or task.  My digestion was totally broken down; consequently, I had autoimmune problems - arthritis, numbness, thyroiditis, fybromialgia, etc.  My tumor was HER2 positive.  I wish I could take this medication.  I have always had a problem taking medication, thus the bilateral matectomy.  I see that women have the same problems with tamoxifen. At 53, I finally reached the point after menopause of being estrogen positive and happy enjoying great brain and bodily functions.  I know I need estrogen in order to have a good quality of life.  I had surgery on March 31, 2009 and had my first granddaughter on April 14, 2009 and my first grandson on August 16,2009.  While longevity is important, quality of life is also, as I want to live every day I've been given to the fullest.  The next five years is a milestone in a little childs and therefore a grandparent's life.",1
"Diagnosed with DCIS, had lumpectomy and 28 days of radiation.  Been on arimidex for 15 days and have had no problems other than itching on palms of hands and bottom of feet.  Has anyone else experienced this?",5
"on arimidex 4 mos.& have experienced every side effect mentioned in the reviews i read. i do have a side effect that wasnt mentioned, but, is listed as a side effect on arimidex information.  i have slight vaginal bleeding. i am concerned i have had a hysterectomy. the arimidex information did not cover this senario. i plan calling my onocologist and obygn first thing in the morning. but i would like to know if any other survivors have experienced this? i will face this head on & because i want to live, i will continue this medication. god bless & good luck to all.",4
Have read every comment on this medication &  the side effects I've experienced are very similar. I am 10 years out and have done everything my oncologist has suggested- 5 years on tamoxifen and nearly 5 years on arimidex. Hot flashes have been a nightmare - lots of joint pain in hands and arms - hbp - cholesterol and triglycerides way up - glucose high - can't lose weight and now have a fatty liver as seen by ultrasound.  While I appreciate the drug I now think that these side effects are also very dangerous. Thankful I am almost finished taking it.....  ,4
"Wil be finishing up my fifth year on this drug January, 2010.  Only minor side effect was ache in some joints but manageable.  I workout so this really helps!",5
"I had a lumpectomy in 2003 and have been on this medication ever since. Fatigue and joint pain are par for the course but an aleve in the morning gets me on my way. This medication is managable with regular exercise and diet. I have gained some weight, because I thought that food would give me energy, but sleep or rest is the only help. I have been fully employed the whole time and my drs say as long as lymph node are involved you could be on the drug longer. As long as the cancer doesn't return, I don't mind. Be mindful of your bones.",5
"I started taking Arimidex in March '09 after a mastectomy for early stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Node negative, no chemo or radiation.  I have experienced hot flashes, which seem to be decreasing in frequency, vaginal dryness, hip and joint pain and fatigue.  The hip pain is worse after sitting for a while and trying to get up.  I've started seeing a chiropractor/acupuncturist to help deal with these side effects.  If the drug will keep cancer from recurring, it will be worth while.",3
"I have been on arimidex since I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in March '09. I had a mastectomy with no chemo or radiation. I have experienced hot flashes, which seem to have decreased,vaginal dryness,  and hip and back pain, worse when sitting and getting up.  I've started seeing a chiropractor/acupuncturist to help with the symptoms.  I'm hoping that will ease the muscle spasms and joint pain. If the drug keeps me from having a recurrence, then, it'll be worth it.",3
"I have been taking for three years now. Am having vaginal dryness, but the biggest problem is that my teeth are cracking and breaking, have broke 5 teeth  in the last 4 mos. I go for reg dental check-up. Any one else having this problem? My doctor said it could be the dry mouth causing it. My medical insurance say that if its due to the pill they would cover dental treatments under medical.Thank-you for any help with this issue.",4
"My sister, a patient in an assisted living facility, is concerned that the drug is unsafe.",2
"After being diagnosed for the 2nd time with breast cancer pre-menopause, I was put on tamoxifen after mastectomy, chemo and radiation.  I was allergic to tamoxifen and put on arimidex.  I hate it!  I have been on it since 2005, vaginal dryness and EXTREME foot and leg cramps that have been getting worse, not better.  I now have a tingling, twitching of the muscles in my thighs.  I hate this drug.  ",4
"I was glad to find a site where other women share their experience with this drug. I am 62, have always been very active, doing aerobics, yoga and dancing.  Now I am having pain and stiffness in my hips, pain in my back, and have had previous neck problems with headaches which seem to be worse.  I also have painful intercourse, dryness.  Like many of you, though, I feel that if this decreases my risk of recurrence then it's worth it.  I have an appointment with a chiropractor for the back problems, and I'm looking for a yoga class to help with stretching and flexibility.  Good luck to you all, and God bless.",4
"Started in August, will have second visit with oncologist in November.  New to this.  I was diagnosed with DCIS and had lumpectomy, then removal after margins were not clear.  Stage 0 at diagnosis. My cancer was discovered on Mammography.  I always have routine tests to keep me healthy as best as possible.  I don't let sleeping dogs lie.  Very important to take care of ourselves-----------",5
My Triglycerides have increased 100 points in 1 year on Arimidex.  Anyone else have that problem?,3
I have had no side effects and remain cancer free 6 years,5
"TO START WITH LOTS OF HOT FLUSHES, BUT THEY HAVE DIED DOWN NOW TO ABOUT 6 A DAY. ITS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY IF IT KEEPS THE CANCER AWAY. SUE.",3
Ive been experiencing joint pain in my hands and fingers. Fingers are hard to make into a fist and swelling. ,4
painful joints sick to my stomache. I have been on it for one year now and alot of the joint pain has gone away I feel alot better. So I feel it takes 1 year to get used to the medicine.,4
I  have been on this medication for about 5 months post lumpectomy and radiation. So far I mostly feel achy especially in the morning or after sitting too long. I have become somewhat sensitive to certain foods and crave others. Has this happened to anyone else? I will continue with the medication as I feel that it is hopefully saving my life.,4
"Still have hot flashes, and trouble sleeping.",3
I have experienced consistent hair loss as well as leg cramping after using arimidex for 3 months.  I have discontinued use!,2
"Hot flashes last about a month,then dissapeard,No joint pain to complain about Thankful for beig able to have a drug like this to take",5
"First constipation, insomnia, dry mouth, hot and cold flashes.  Already had some joint pain, doesn't seems worse.  Now after about 2 months I'm experiencing numbness in both hands and up my left arm at night.  My breasts are extememly dense, lumpy and sore.  My skin is looking old on my body.  I see my oncologist tomorrow and plan to quit.  It's not worth it.",5
ALL THE USUAL ACHES AND PAINS THAT GO WITH IT BUT GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE,5
"Started taking in Jan'09 following lumpectomomy, mamo-site radiation, and chemo. Only NEW symptom I have is vaginal dryness, which can be treated with OTC preparations. Already had stiffness in hips, hands, ankles in the morning and after sitting for a long period--haven't determined stiffness is worse or same. Goes away within a few minutes of becoming active. ",5
"When I finished my rounds of chemo and radiation, my hair started growing back thick and curly like it always had been. Then it started thinning and I have developed male-pattern baldness. I have very little hair on the top of my head and limp hair elsewhere on my head. I am so scared I will go completely bald again like I did with chemo! I do have aches in my knees and back, but not terribly.",3
"I feel like I am cured which is sort of impossible, but I have had only minor hotflushes nothing to worry about. otherwise feel normal, together with zamatol injections everything feels fine. And my Oncologist seems very opleased with results so far",5
The hot flashes and sweating haven't let up since I started this drug 3 years ago. Also vaginal dryness if terrible.  I have also developed nervous conditions such as increased anxiety and claustrophobia. I will suffer through it if it will prolong my life.    ,5
"After taking A. for 4 months, I have had foot,knee, and hand joint pains, plus very noticeable vaginal dryness.  The joint pains are worse in the morning, but I walk and exercise then, so my day seems to be mostly pain free, but  I stiffen up noticeably, once I sit down for a time.  I started drinking soy milk and found the v. dryness lessened considerably, but have reduces that now, not wanting to add plant estrogens that might feed my ""hormone receptor positive"" cells.  I am a type 1 diabetic, so I watch my diet religiously and have not had weight gain.  My night sweats are light and not much of a problem.  I have worried that the joint aches will become a  permanent arthritis condition.  With a positive attitude, exercise, and my job to think about, I find my days are busy.  I do feel noticeably older than I am, but try to not dwell on that.   No one else sees me as old as I feel, with my hands clumsy, slow,and weak, and my knees wobbly.    A smile really helps me and everyone else.  Keep smiling..! Don't give up.",4
this medication seems to be working for me. My last pet scan showed negattive. I do feel nauseus almost all the time and am eating less. Do not know if this is a side effect.,5
"hot flashes, extreme pain in just about all my joints. my hands look like theyve been hit with a hammer, back hurts all the time. feet and legs ache. i ride bikes, try to walk but its very painful. my husband is wonderful, he gets the fan or turns on the air conditioner whenever he sees me having a hot flash. hes very patient with me in bed so sex is still great. its been 2 years october 2 i will stay on the drug, even though i dont like the way i feel. i love life, my 3 girls and my 6 grandchildren, want to be around a long time.",5
"I will have been on this medication in Feb 2010, I will never be so glad to be off this to feel my old self again, I have had balance problems , depression, ache all over for 5 yrs. I feel like 90 instead of 69. I ask oncologists to take me off with no luck. I was stage 2.",4
Entering my 5th year on this drug; hot flashes have improved over time; but joint aches and pains have increased especially in the arms.,4
I have a great deal of side effects from this med.,4
Starting 5th year on arimidex. 10 lbs wt gain only side effect. Take Vitamins D & calcium twice daily to counteract possible bone loss. Exercise and Yoga are lifesavers!,5
I had a lumpectomy and radiation. have been on arimdex for 1yr.severe pain in feet in am and vaginal dryness. feel like i'm 90yrs old. will i ever be the same? i guess this is the price for not getting cancer back.,4
"Mild joint pain, moving pains,chest--sore at times, feet feel and leg stiffness, sometimes it is gone, but hard to walk at times. Heart palpitations at times at night, disturbed sleep. In the beginning my shoulder froze up--exercised to get rid of.  Trigger finger after about 3 months and haven't had it since.  Aches in wrist joints. Pelvis goes out of place with shooting pains to back of right knee. ",5
"Surgery and radiation almost 2 years ago, then Arimidex.  Experience hot flashes and wrist joint pain particularly in the morning.  On exercise and diet program and lost 15 lbs. so energy level is fine.  I am not a gambler, but the odds are better with this drug.  Just keep a positive attitude and enjoy life each day.",5
I ache from my shoulders to my toes and experience every symptom listed by others.  I am fortunate that my husband looks after me but I think that if it were not for him that I would have discontinued it and taken my chances.,5
"Physically, I am doing fine with the Arimidex....it will be 2 years this November. However, have just begun to connect that my memory and concentration issues may be the result of this medication. I quit one job..after being there 8 years because I was making important mistakes and did not want to get fired. Now on new job, still memory problems, and lately weepy most of the time. I take Effexor, works great for hot flashes...Klonopin for anxiety...and Trazadone for sleep (wonderful stuff). But I don't think there is anything I can take for loosing my thinking skills...I was as sharp as they come...now it takes all of my effort and constant use of a note pad to keep on track....it's like I have really bad ADD. Will be talking to my doc about it in October. ",5
I have had no problem,5
"I have read alot of your reviews.  I have only been taking Arimidex for 1 month and have had alot of the same side effects but  consider all of them mild at this stage.  About 5 hrs. after taking I get very hot and start to perspire on my forhead and breasts, I usually do not sweat at all.  Very uncomfortable but only lasts about 1/2 hour.  I am having headaches but I also have migraines so this is not too bad.  I have felt really sore arms around my elbows or lower arms, feels bad but not severe.  Sometimes I get itching on my arms also, but I can take it.  The worst is the pain in my neck that hurts bad and it becomes kind of stiff also.  I know that I have arthritis in my neck so I am sure this is a contributor to the pain.  You can get shots from your doctor to help this and other pain associated with arthritis;  they are steroids but if you get the shot in the muscle it does not effect you like when athletes take it, at least that is what my doctor told me. My finger got hot on the tip one day and I thought that was weird.  I have not felt any weakness so far and hope I don't.  I am 65 and am in what I consider really good health, except for this. I had a lumpectomy on July 28 2009 and they got it all.  Only had to have one node removed as it had not spread.  I will start radiation for 6 weeks in Oct.  I am praying for all of you and myself that the symtoms get better and that it outways the alternative.  God bless you all.",3
After taking this drug for 6 week I began to have chest discomfort which I interpreted as breathing difficulty. I wondered if the radiation treatments had caused lung damage. My doctors assured me that this was not possible. The discomfort became progressively worse and one day I went into a very rapid heart rate with severe chest pressure and difficulty breathing. I felt as though I would pass out. I called 911 and I was taken to the ER and admitted to a cardiac  unit for 24 hours observation and test. A cardiac event was ruled out. I looked up the drug for side it's effects. Some people have chest pain and vasodilation  with this drug. I feel as though this is a side effect from this drug and no-one will listen to me about it. I am wondering what my options are. I have never experienced anything like this before.,3
"Joint pain, muscle pain, new onset osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, migraines. General pain - hope the benefits outweigh the discomfort of this medication.",4
I was amazed at the side effects were so many-no night sweats- but the fatique is sometimes overwhelming and the knee pain is terrible- am using a cane now-already had arthritis in knees-did not realize that this med caused so much discomfort-i will tolerate these side effects as long as it keeps the cancer from reappearing-AMEN,5
"I had a severe depression occur about a month after I started this drug, I also have trouble sleeping",3
I've been reading some of the posts. I had the great fatigue some were mentioning. My oncologist did routine blood work and found I had very low iron. This has been about 3 months ago and I feel much better. I am taking a large dose of iron and B12.I'll never run a marathon but I wasn't in the greatest shape before cancer. I do have a problem with hot flashes during the day and at night.My arthritis is a little worse but not to hinder daily activities. I will continue this therapy because I feel it will help protect me from recurrence. It was interesting to see people mention weight gain and bloating. I've been on it for a little over a year and these have just now been a problem. I had been on a diet and and lost over 20 lbs before I was disgnosed and I have put it back on these last few months. I don't feel like I had over eaten but who knows. My best to you all.,4
"Chemo & Rad. 5 yrs. Tamoxifin for 5yrs. and now 3rd year of Arimidex.  Extreme joint pain esp. after waking.  Hot flashes have diminished somewhat but still wake me 1-2 times a night.  Gained 15 lbs., cholestorol is elevated and trig as well. New symptom recently is breast tenderness and pain.  Is there any info about 5 yrs. on this is any better than 3yrs. or less maybe?",4
"So far the only side effect I have had is some tiredness.  However, I cannot contribute this solely to the medication as I am also receiving radiation therapy.",4
Locally advanced stage 3 bc with 2 nodes involvement after chemo. Started Arimidex around Feb and gradually developed severe joint pain which was somewhat helped by movement. Dr switched me to Tamoxifen which was horrible right away. Took two week drug vacation and started on Femara. Only mild joint pain so far but a slight weight gain which might be eating more. I liked the Arimidex as it seemed to cause no side effects other than the joint pain. Good luck to everyone out here. We're in this together.,3
"Is anyone having acne flares because of Arimidex?  I have it anyway, but this is ridiculous! 57 and teenage pizza face!!!!  Been on A for 9mos.",5
I take one coated aleve every day for joint pain. Works well. Cholestrol really high. Went to a nutrionist and lost 32 lbs in a year. Helps with the cholestrol and joints. Walk daily even when I am tired which is most of the time. Haven't slept well since tamoxifen. Think fatigue is caused by the problem with sleeping. Keep a positive attitude and don't give in. I work full time and haven't missed work because of this med. This is my second breast cancer in eight years. Just get up every day and show up for life. The rest is up to you.,4
"Have been taking Arimidex for 2 1/2 yrs.  After first 6 weeks developed severe headaches.  Took a break from med for 3 weeks and headaches slowly went away. Have bad night sweats, no sexual desire, and hurt all over.  Started with my joints, but now its muscles aches too.  I know I am getting older, but it shouldn't happen this fast.  Trying to make an informed decision.  Have been told I can ""take a break for 3 weeks"" because the medicine stays in your system for that long.  Gonna give that another try because it did work for the headaches.  Good luck Ladies!",3
I have had this for 2 months with no apparent effects. On the second day of taking it though I woke up with a bizarre headache that didn't develop into a migraine. But as the day progressed I became dizzy and ended up on th floor. I then rush to the loo with diahorrea and all the unpleasantness disappeared!,5
"I have taken this drug for 5 years. I will stop in November, 2009. I have gained over 60 pounds, I have severe muscle spasms and the latest problem is lower back muscle spasms. This could be due to weight gain. But the most important thing is I am still alive and dealing with all of my complications! God is good! ",5
I have had a lot of joint and muscle pain...change in weight and generally not feeling great...,3
"25 year survivor! Side effects can be of those you might have on Crestor or other statins--I had to stop the statin Crestor to see.  Sure enough most of the bad muscle aches dissapeared.  Have have some aches in shoulders, wrists, legs and feet at random.Hot flashes or sweats during day sometimes but mostly at night.  1984 carcinoma insitu with 5 lymph nodes involved, breast and lymph nodes removed on right side, estrogen receptive, took tamoxifin for 9 years.  2000 left side estrogen receptive carcinoma insitu no lymph nodes involved but had 3 flat polyps in colon that could have been cancer, but wasn't. 8 1/4"" colon removed along with left breast.  Not put on any medication. 2008 9mm lund nodule -- told the doctor not lung cancer--look for estrogen receptive--removed partial lymph node on same side as 1984.  Estrogen receptive--put on Arimidex in January 2009. ",5
"Have been on Arimidex for 3 1/2 years and since that time have had to have 3 root canals done and don't know if the arimidex producers have checked into this side-effect.  Another s/e is that within one month both of my vitreous ruptured, can't find any reference to the eyes in Arimidex's literature. of course I have the bones creaking and feel like a bowl of rice krispies, I take Glucosamine/chondrointin/msm for that which really helps. The weight gain, especially in my belly seems like a lost cause. At times I have the nausea still, as well as headaches.  I'm just hoping the drug works!",3
This pill is as easy as taking an aspirin.  I take it right before I go to bed.  I have had no side effects that I know of other than maybe a little soreness.  But I do have a little arthritis so that could be the cause of the soreness as well.  ,5
"i have had all the side effects that have been mentioned with the exception of the headaches.  i have decided taking this med beats the alternative all to pieces and i am fully enjoying each and every day to its fullest, and am so thankful for being alive! ",1
"going into my fourth year.  side effects significant:  pain in all joints, muscles, and sometimes, i think, bones.  very dry eyes, very thin hair, memory loss, hot flashes controlled with effexor. i take MSM with glucosamine for the stiffness and pain.  fatigue is the worst. at least I'm cancer free for now.              ",5
"I am experiencing very bad arthritis symptoms,in my hands shoulders& neck not to mention hot flashes and tiredness.",4
"I started taking 1mg daily of Arimidex on 2/1/09, I take it early morn w/my BP pill.  The stiffness after sitting & trying to get up is excruiating, the bone pain is bad at night, especially in the arms & hands, legs and feet; swelling is bad in the hands and feet as well. Weight gain is another issue with this medication.  I constantly feel ""bloated"".  My Oncologist gave me a Rx for a very mild anti-depressant, saying most patients have good results when taken with the Arimidex, but I had serious issues w/it and stopped after a week.  I also tried Aromasin & it was no better; I know my breast cancer is estogen fed so I need to take this pill daily for 5 years, or so I'm told.  Is there anything better?  I also get acupuncture for the pain; sometimes helps, sometimes no. I started doing Curves 3 times a week since February.  The key is constant moving -   Last chemo was 1/2/09 and my hair is very slowly coming back but still very thin and only 1/2 to 1 inch long. I believe it is the Arimidex.  But, hey, I'm alive and otherwise well.  ",4
"After taking Arimidex for three days I developed painful and frequent unination.  I thought I had either a vaginal infection or UTI--had symptoms for both.  Two different doctors (OB/GYN and Urologist) prescribed antibiotics even though my urine was clear.  The symptom which was puzzling was that I had pain and cramping half of the day.  After ""thinking outside the box"" I read that painful, frequent urination was a side effect that prompted me to ""see my doctor immediately.""  I took the med early in the morning and didn't have symptoms until afternoon and evening.  Then when I went to sleep at night, I had no symptoms.  I believe that I had the symptoms whenever the Arimidex got fully into my system during the afternoon and evening.  It has been six weeks since I started taking Arimidex.  I have an appointment tomorrow with my oncologist.  I read nothing about this symptom in the one hundred comments that I read.  Has anyone else had itching, pressure, cramps during urination.  Also most of the time, no urine came.  I went to the bathroom every half hour.",3
Cancer-free for almost 3 1/2 years now. On Arimidex since end of radiation treatments in December of '05. Many side effects -- 35-pound weight gain; hot flashes which are better now; joint pain. No sex drive whatsoever.I Will remain on this drug for another 1 1/2 years.  Best of luck to other cancer survivors!,4
"I have had severe joint pain in my hips,knees, & shoulders since taking arimidex.  I would be unable to walk if it weren't for Celebrex. I also have increased blood pressure and ankle swelling. I've torn the meniscus in both knees just doing normal stuff. I hope the joint problems are reversable. I can live with the constipation & vaginal dryness.",4
I take it and night and sometimes wake up with a shaky stomach but other than that there are no problems.,4
I had a lumpectomy and some lymph nodes removed and have to go back for more surgery. My oncologist started me on Arimidex and I have been on it for 3 weeks and just stated to have vaginal bleeding cramps. Since I am 77 I do not get a period. I have read all the reviews and noone has said they had these side effects. Is it common and how long does it last?,5
"I have taken Arimidex for 13 months. I had heard about stiffness as a side effect. My doctor suggested Omega 3 (fish oil). My stiffness has greatly improved within 6 months.  Yes, my hair is thinner, but after going though chemotherapy and no hair, I am satisfied. Sometimes I do get dizzy. It only lasts a second.  Yes, there are hot flashes.  Some days more than others. A cool washcloth helps. I am on Fossimax due to loss of bone density which can happen with Arimidex. I also take Calcium. One day at a time.  I am 52, alive and happy!",4
"Have been on Arimidex for 2 months, have side effects of weight gain, hair loss, stiffness and some swelling in hands and legs, but water with lemon helps with fluid. Have not had surgery but 10 treatments of radiation, tumors appear smaller.  Will have CT Scan next week to verify. Having infusion of Zometa once a month for bone strengthening, 8000mg of Vitamin D and 1500mg of calcium. Thanks for the postings...the weight gain is my biggest issue, and not sure how to handle, but going to have a chat with oncologist.  God Bless each of you.",5
"I have been on it for 3 years.  I had joint & muscle aches, even my toes hurt.  Doctor put me on anti inflammatory for one month about a year ago and during that time I started flexability exercises.  I rarely have these pains anymore. I still have some difficulty getting up from a squatting position though.  I think the exercises really help and I have been walking also.  I still have some hot flashes, but not as bad as they were the first couple of years.  They are mostly at night so i keep my bedroom really cold and keep a fan by my bed.",5
"HORRIBLE side effects. Worst being a headache. Not just any headache but one that, never went away, hurt intensely, and didn't lessen with any medications. I was moody and irritable, joint pain in knees, cholesterol raised dramatically, already had hot flashes and lack of libido. IT WAS UNBEARABLE! I stopped taking it and will see what my 6 month mammagram shows.",1
"I have been on this drug for 23 weeks.  The doctor gave me Effexor for the hot flashes and that helped.  My body hurts ever joint, I get cramps in my feet, I feel live I've aged 15 years.  I have no energy.  The doctor keept telling me to stay on it.  Does anyone have any helpful hints for all the body aches?",3
"All I can say is I am alive and still in remision after cancer metastasis to my liver 5 years ago.  This is after taking tamoxifen for five years previously for the original, non-metastatic diagnosis.  The only really bothersome side-effect for me has been weight gain, but having been on the tamoxifen for so long before hand (and having already had a hystorectomy) I don't know that the usual menopausal type symptoms would even apply.  I would certainly recomend this medication to someone in my situation.  ",5
"I was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma, had a complete hysterctomy and 7 months of chemo. My tumor was hormone receptive and I was started on Arimidex after completion of my chemo. I remain NED at last CT/Pet which was done 1 yr post chemo. I have had no side effects. The only thing that I am experiencing is NO LABIDO. However, this I feel is in direct correlation with my hysterectomy. I take a calcium/magnesium supplement to help defer the effects of bone loss. I am 51 yrs old. My last bone scan showed minimal loss. I have faith that Arimidex will assist in the decreasing the risk of recurrance of cancer. I can handle any side effects if I know I remain cancer free. It is worth it to me. I have had difficulty losing the 30 lbs. I gained while going through my cancer treatment. I don't know if Arimidex contributes to this. And, I have a small amount of edema which I understand is a side effect of Arimidex. Again, I feel the benifits out weigh the risks and side effects and plan to continue taking this medication indefinitly.",4
" DCIS invasive. Lumpectomy 12/08, 6 weeks of Radiation.Started Arimidex 4 weeks ago.  knee problems are worse (have arthritis ) hair thinning , slightly light headed, fatigue, and voracious appetite ! I'm taking it one day at a time.I can handle it if it stays at this level ..except for the wgt. gain .4 lbs. already and I'm overweight to start with. Yikes",2
"I have been on Arimidex since Sept 06. Have experienced joint pain for which exercise has helped. One doctor told me to get 8 hours of sleep every night. I believe this has helped immensely. Glad to know that others have experienced the weight gain and thinning hair. I use Rogaine. The most bothersome side effect are the hot flashes. I will try the effexor. I am extremely grateful to be alive to take Arimidex, having lost a very good friend to breast cancer 9 years ago.",4
other than getting dizzy I have not had any other side affects,3
"I developed neuropathy in both hands within a month of starting, which makes them difficult to use for daily tasks and is so painful at night that it affects my sleep.  Bone density has deteriorated severely and hip and knee are very painful.  I do not believe that depriving the whole body of estrogen is a good remedy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  I am trying to find a better alternative, but Aromasin seems to cause similar problems.  Will probably quit soon in favor of nutritional and alternative health solutions.",3
"TO THE LADY WHOSE MEDICARE D RUNS OUT IN JULY ASK DOC ABOUT APPLYING FOR FREE AMIRIDEX, FROM COMPANY WHO MAKES IT. IF DOC DOESN'T KNOW ASK OFFICE PERSONAL. I AM ON SOCIALSECURITY NO INSURANCE AND CAN'T GET MEDICARE YET",4
"Within a few weeks of taking Arimidex, I started having tremendous hot flashes, dizziness, short term memory loss, nausea, and my blood pressure (which had always been within normal range) soared to 169/96.  I would cry in an instant over everything, or nothing.  I tried to take this medicine twice, with the same results each time.  I finally made the decision to stop taking it permanently.  If I were to only have 3 good years of life remaining, it would beat having 5 -10 years while taking Arimidex.  This drug is horrible!",1
"Had surgery to remove breast and some lymph nodes. Have been on med for 5 1/2 years. did not have chemo or radiation, because of a bad infection in the surgery site.have had joint ache's and some weight gain. But no return of the cancer....Going to see my Dr. for my 6 mo. check up next week, and hoping all is still going well..Could use prayers..Thanks",5
"I had a mastectomy in January '08, and started Arimidex in March '08. I have developed the arthritic pains in my hands and I have flare-ups of aches and pains in my arms, back and legs.  I discovered that by seriously reducing the sugar in my diet, most of the pain disappears.  An occasional Motrin takes care of the arthritic thumb joint.",4
"I have been on this drug for 1 year I have been having terrible hot flashes with profuse sweating,numbness & tingling in my hands and feet. I am not sure I want to continue with this drug & am not sure what my oncologist will be receptive to with changing the medication.",2
"I've been taking Arimidex for several months, and thought there would be no side effects, because there weren't any at first.  WRONG!  I have been dizzy, had hot flashes, vaginal burning and dryness, and am extremely worn out.  I thought it was something else, till I decided to check on the side effects again -- hadn't looked since before I started the drug.  Guess I have to keep on for 4 1/2 more years, since I don't want the cancer back.  If this is the way it is, it is going to be a very long 4 1/2 years.  It sure would be nice to feel good again......but I guess that won't happen for a long time.  ",3
"I had slight nausea, bad fatigue, and worst of all really bad headaches which would not respond to any medication including my migraine medicine.  After 3 months of this I was switched to Aromasin which is similar.  After only 3 doses of this I started with the really bad headaches again.  So now I have stopped this also.  Will start on something new soon. Five years was just too long to suffer with the headaches.  Otherwise I would have remained on it because it has a very good success rate.",5
"Diagnosed 10/08,started Arimidex10/08 with Zometa for bone strengthening for an  easily palpable lump + sacrum mass. 02/09 lump not palpable.No surgery,radiation,or chemo. Awaiting new bone scan. Gained wt, some joint pain especially after inactivity. Cost prohibitive ($300+) if no insurance. The only change I have made have been dietary--High antioxidant juicing daily as a supplement.",5
"I have had no adverse affects so far, He nearly completed 5 years on the drug.",5
"I HAVE BEEN ON ARIMIDEX FOR 4 YEARS. I CAN NO LONGER HANDLE THE MANY SIDE EFFECTS OF  THIS  MED SO I HAVE STOPPED..ALTHOUGH I HAD EVERY INTENSION TO DO 5 YRS.  DID A LOT OF RESEARCH, AND HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION THAT I CAN LIVE WITH. I FEEL AT PEACE WITH MY CHOICE.      ",4
"I have only been taking it for 7 months. I get joint pain around my back,legs arms. My stomache gets upset once in awhile. But if it helps me from cancer not coming back I am not complaining.",3
Can't answer.  Just started last night,1
17 week clinical trial before lumpectomy and radiation therapy.   will continue this medication for 5 years.,4
"I have been on Arimidex for 3 months.Have been experiencing a lot of the symptoms that I see posted here.  I have pretty severe shoulder pain, short term memory loss,and the fatigue has started. Also,I have a lot of insomnia, and cannot lie on my left side(my favorite) for very long due to hip pain.I don't know about the hair thinning yet, because I had just completed chemo, and my hair is still trying to grow back, although it does seem to be coming back slowly.  At my checkup the nurse seemed less than interested in my side effects.  I am very thankful for the medicine, but, I,too, worry about the long term effects on the body.Thanks to all of you who have taken the time to post, it is very helpful. God Bless us all.",5
Cancer-free for almost 2 1/2 years now.  On Arimidex since end of radiation treatments in November of '06.  Many side effects -- 40-pound weight gain; hot flashes which are better now with Effexor; hip pain (burning sensation after walking not very far); stiff joints; and mainly FATIGUE.  Feel 90 years old with no sex drive whatsoever.  Will remain on this drug for another 2 1/2 years with reservations.  Best of luck to other cancer survivors!,4
"I could no longer endure the hip and joint pain, the severe depression, and the cognitive problems.",5
No major side effects after using it for one year.  Some weight gain and joint stiffness.,5
"Wow!  After reading all the commments you all have posted, you have put my mind at ease.  I have been on this drug for 7 months and take it at night.  The hot flashes are unbearable but taking this at night I dont notice the hot flashes that much.  I was terrified of the severe upper arm pains i get, but I see I am not alone. The pains last 2-3 days each time then goes away for a while.  I do have to concentrate harder and write things down to remember. I cant wait for the 5 years to be over. I guess the benefits outweigh the side effects.  I dont have hair loss with this drug but it has come back (after chemo) very curly (UGH!!)  Thank you so much for your comments!!!",5
"I started on Arimidex after surgery and radiation - I could not tolerate Tamoxifen and was taken off it after 3 weeks.  I tolerate Arimidex well, but have noticed that I feel very ""foggy"" mentally and have low energy. I am nor sure if this is caused by Arimidex or not.",3
"Since beginning Arimidex, December 1, 2008, My blood pressure and blood glucose levels went through the roof.  My Primary Care Physician put me on Metformin.  Has anyone else had this happen to her?  ",4

"Breast cancer. Started Arimidex about 3 yrs ago. Experienced all the pains you ladies talk about. Joint and muscle, insomnia, higher cholesterol & triglycerides were the worst, and trigger finger in my thumb. I went off the drug 2 mos ago, and the trigger finger is much better as well as aches & pains. More energy and feel much better in general. Doctor is going to put me on Aromasin (sister drug). I'll keep you posted. I am still cancer free with God's blessings and good doctors. Prayer does work",4
I have been on Arimidex since October 2006.  I have had muscle and joint pain and have found relief by taking Celebrex.  ,4
"I have been on this since 08/2007.  Joint aches, memory problems, headaches and extreme hot flashes.  I also broke my foot in December and cannot seem to get this to heal is this related to the meds.",3

treatment seems satisfactory except I am having knee pain and swelling. Has anyone else had these symptoms?,4
This is completely and utterly a god sent drug! I am on HRT for men and the aromatization of the testosterone they were giving me was worse than the low level. This stuff has ceased the aromatization completely and I feel like a man again. I know most of the women wont find this helpful but I dont like having estrogen in my blood stream........,5
"I am 60 years old and was diagonsed with Ductal Caraonma, had a lump removed and 10 lymphnodes my doctor recomended Amimidex and after reading some of these reviews I was not looking forwarding to taking it, but as it turns out I am on it 6 weeks and other than hot flashes which I had anyway and my joints ached anyway.  I am doing great.  My first MRI last week came out clear and I don't need to have another one for 6 months.  I hope this helps someone who has to take this medication.",5
"I am 2 years into the Arimidex treatment.  Can't wait for the 5 years to be over with.  Extreme joint pain which moves all over the body.  Most pain is in the hips, legs and feet. Alot of trouble getting up from a sitting position and don't even think about squatting.  I'm 44 years old and feel 90.  Sleepless nights, hot flashes, the works.  Recently diagnosed with Osteoporosis, most likely caused by the Arimidex per my oncologist.  Remains to be seen what that medication causes.  Just tired of the whole situation.  Definitely will not take it after 5 years.  To me, quality of life is much more important than long lifespan.  I just hope it is actually working.  ",3
"Wow!  Finally hearing the ""truths"" behind this medicine.  I took Arimidex for four years.  Never thought I would be one of those patients who took themselves off the medicine but...after a 30 pound weight gain I emotionally couldn't take it anymore.  No matter how much I exercised and cut my calories I gained weight.  My doctor told me to stop eating so much!! How insulting!  Finally feel great about me again!  There's a lot to be said about feeling good.",4
"I have taken this drug for 2 1/2 yrs. In the beginning I too experienced all the side effects mentioned, but they have subsided somewhat. Still have night sweats, memory is sporadic, but joint pain is minimal and so is leg and hand spasms. Hopefully when this is over everything will be back to normal,time will tell. Wish you all good health and God Bless. ",4
"I was first diagnosed with ductal carsonoma insitu,but that soon changed I have had two biopsies and one surgery ,chemoand radiation. I am now on and aromatase inhibitor(Arimidex) and also have to take Fosamx,but hesitate for all the warings sent out to me by lawyers in Maryland.The Arimidex seems to be ok ,joint pain all over and a head ache about four hours later.My doctor and nurse got all weird when I told them the news about Fosamax was too complelling to ignore. They said ""Why don't you go somewhere else,if you don't like our choices for yo.Like how rude is that?",3
"I'm going into my 3rd yr of Armidex, had Tamoxifen first. I thought my trigger fingers & thumb was from excessive knitting! Like most of what I read, I have aches & pain in getting around in morning, tiredness, hot flashes every hour,fuzzy brain, feel older than 56. Cholesterol went up too. Eat healthy, ladies! and exercise daily-after 2 surgeries, chemo & radiation, I don't want cancer again.",5

Since I have been using the drug arimidex I have very dry vaginal area and pain during intercourse. Is there anything that I can use to help this problem.,4
I've been on Arimidex for 3 months and the pain is terrible. I am starting to have more fatigue and overall pain in bones and muscles. My hair is thinning and I feel terrible! I don't have much choice in taking this drug but the side effects are worse than I expected. Maybe just finishing 13 months of chemo and starting to feel better made this even harder to take. I usually very optimistic but find myself more depressed than I've ever been. My oncologist says these side effect usually get better after the first 6-8 months. I sure hope he's right!,4
"I have been on Arimidex for 1 1/2 years. In the beginning I had severe joint pain. Now I have trigger fingers on my thumbs and some spasms in my hands, legs and feet. My biggest problem is my resistance is low and I get sinus problems, bronchitis and asthma. Does anyone else have this problem?",4
"I have only been on Arimidex for three months.  I am experiencing all of the side effects you have described.  Trouble sleeping, aches in every joint and muscle, and pain when trying to be intimate with my husband.  My oncologist took me off of this drug today.  Thank You!  I was cancer free for 11 years, and found a small lump in the affected breast that had been treated with lumpectomy and radiation,in May of 2008.  I had a mastectomy.  Taking Arimidex was an option for me, not a requirment.  I am also taking Zometa, which is an IV, given every four months.  It is normally given to patients with osteoporosis.  Tests have shown that it can also help to prevent a reoccurrance of breast cancer.  I'm going to continue with that treatment.  God Bless all of you!",2

I too have all the symptoms/ side effects of severe joint pain, hot flashes/flushes, stiffness, memory issues and wonder too if there are long-term effects to taking this drug. I think it is too early to know the effectiveness for me so rated low. I am 58 years old (57 when diagnosed) and feel many days like I am 90! It is not a pleasant drug to take and I only pray the benefits outway all this. ",3

I also had a hysterectomy with ovary removal in 2006.  I have found that I have memory loss, weight gain and severe pain in my joints.  I worry that the Arimidex is doing permanent damage to my joints.  It is comforting to hear that everyone is having the same problem. (if there is any comfort in that!)  My questions is what happens after the 5 year period. ",4
"I've been on this drug a little less than 4 years.  While I'm relived to now know what's causing me to feel 100 years old, I'm wondering if I can stand all the side effects for another year.

For the past several weeks it is concentrating in my shoulders.  I can't lift my arms, can't sleep--basically debilitating.  I can't bend over or kneel.

Trouble remembering things at times & wonder if that's related. Don't know how I would have survived if it wasn't for Wayne W. Dyer's wonderful books and meditation tapes!",4

"SEVERE JOINT PAIN, HEADACHES, CONSTIPATION",2
I had tried all the other medications that they give women that have had breast cancer and had side affects with all of the other medications.  So far I have not had any problems with Arimidex.,5
I have been on amimidex for about 2 mths. had joint pain in the beginning. Now I get night sweats.I do feel fatigue but not sure if its from surgery and radition. I can live with all side effects. Just don't want to get cancer back.,4

"On Arimidex after surgery/radiation at 61.  Currently experiencing joint/muscle pain and stiffness, hot flashes, thinning hair, weight loss and sleepless nights.  I have vaginal discharge and dryness.  Dr recommended I douche with 1/4 vinegar and distilled water (I douche each time I shower and use a lubricate during intercourse).  Also have 7% bone density loss and will be starting Actonel. Considering Femara.  I take calcium, D, Magnesium, C, Folic Acid, Flaxseed oil and Fish Oil.  I work out three times a week cardio and weights and bike and play golf.  Sometimes these activities are harder to do but I do it as much as possible.  So far mentally I'm fine.  Thank you for sharing your experiences.  It has helped me continue on and so far cancer free.  ",4
"Wow,,, thought I was just getting too old too fast but I see others have had the same side effects.  Have been on Arimidex for about 2 years. Tops of my feet tingle and it can be painfull to wear shoes laced snugly.  Left thumb pain, all fingers aresore.  Knee paid but I think that is related to weight and previous history of knee pain/injury before Arimidex.  Hip pain when laying on my side.  Previous history of LBP so do not feel Arimidex has influenced the pain I already have in back.  Elbow pain sometimes at night.  Had problems sleeping during first year but no problems now.  I had hot flashes before Arimidex due to full historectomy at age 33 for endometriosis so it is nothing new for me. I have some hair thining but could be in genes,,mom has that problem too. Memory loss is bothersome,, especially because retaining info for my new job has been difficult at times.  I also find I am not able to type as fast or as accurately as before.  Not sure why but all of this is just fine with me as long as cancer does not come back..  PS: CANCER SUCKS",5
After more than 2 years I am investigating side effects.  The fatigue I had ascribed to my heart meds and condition may very well be due to this drug. Changes in my drug plan have made this drug too costly.  I am considering stopping it or getting it online at less than half of the cost.  Consulting with my oncologist this week before deciding.,3
"I am in remission for ten years from brest cancer in my left breat. Recently they discovered benign lessions in my right breast. Should I take Arimidex as a precautionary measure. Or, just keep the breast under survailance, rather than endure the potential side effects of Arimidex.",1

Been on Arimidex for almost a year and I've actually LOST weight, no hair loss, some short term memory loss (formerly attributed to that second glass of wine), no dizziness, fatigue or sleeplessness.  Four hundred hot flashes a day reduced to one or two with the help of Effexor (thank you, Drug Gods!), but I do experience frequent extreme pain at the base of both thumbs,  Usually Aleve works for that.  As others have said, this sure beats the alternative.  I'm very lucky to have good insurance because this drug runs to about $11 per pill, for which the drug maker should be ashamed.  Stay positive, girlfriends!",5
"I have been pleased with this treatment. My question is what do you do when the 5 yrs. are up for this medicine.  Do you continue, stop all, take something else. no one knows.",4
HIP JOINT PROBLEMS AND DIZZINESS ARE THE MAIN SIDE EFFECTS. BUT THESE CAN BE DEALTH WITH.  ALSO WEIGHT GAIN ALMOST 40 LBS IN 2 YEARS/,5
"Thanks ladies for your comments. I've been on Arimidex 2 1/2 yrs.  I'm 65, and my symptoms continue to change. Have the ache joints, specially the shoulders, hands hips. Stiff in the mornings and then again late in the day around 4 or 5pm.  I find a nap really helps. Insomnia for 21/2 yrs, just now getting better. Memory loss, thinning hair, depression. Now dizzness and vertigo have just started, and my cholesterol & triglycerides are high. Never had that problem before. And trigger finger in my thumb - WOW! It's excruciating! I do wish the doctors had told me to expect some of these problems. And even with all these symptoms aren't we blessed to be cancer free. I won't stop taking Arimidex, I would worry myself to death. Thank you all for sharing, it makes it much easier to cope with, and now I don't feel like I'm alone or going crazy. Keep the faith ladies.",5
"I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 1/2 years.  The worst side effect with which I am dealing is trigger finger and both thumbs.  The pain is excruciating and almost unbearable at times; taping provides only moderate relief.  Have some hair thinning and occasional fatigue which a 10-minute nap relieves.  I'm not even considering going off this drug but am afraid that surgery is in the offing for the trigger finger situation.  Was tested for arthritis and, through process of elimination, have pretty much concluded that it's the Arimidex.  Am blessed to continue to be cancer free, so will continue to ""grit it out"" for the next 2 1/2 years.  To any of you ladies who have had the surgery for trigger fingers - was it successful and do you recommend it?  Thanks for ""listening""!",5
"I've been on arimadex 2 1/2 years.  I am glad to be cancer free and will continue the Arimadex, but at 59 I feel like I'm 80.  Hot flashes, aches & Pains, stiffness, trouble getting up when stooping, extreme tiredness, trying to exercise and walk to build my bones, but am so tired.  Broke a bone this year and discovered my osteopenia had turned into severe osteoporosis.  I've always thought of myself as healthy & energetic before, but now I seem to be a tired, very fragile, old woman -- but praise God at least I'm cancer free.",5
"Ladies, I feel so much better after reading your posts. I've been on Arimidex for 2 1/2 yrs. Experienced same aches & pains, but unable to sleep has been awful. But better than having cancer. Just this last month I have been dizzy, off balance, and now vertigo. Just knowing I'm not the only one makes it easier to cope with. I didn't know what a trigger finger was (never heard of it), but my thumb is like that. I just thought it was arthritis, but now I can gladly ""live"" with it. Sure it hurts, but we are cancer free. That is a blessing and I can take Arimidex and not worry as much. With God's help we are survivors. It's been three cancer free years for me.",4
"I tried Arimidex after trying Femara and Aromasin. With all three of these I experienced severe, debilitating headaches, confusion and some major depression. I was unable to function and had to make the decision to stop taking anything. This was after my 5-year stint with Tamoxifen from which I had few if any side effects. Since my cancer was stage 3, I am quite anxious about not taking anything at all. Searches for other options have left me worried and frustrated.  ",2
"I'm a breast cancer survivor 2 years and I've been on Arimidex.  I've gained weight, had horrible pain in my joints, especially my legs, hair thinning, horrible sweats(My oncolgist put me on Neurontin 2x daily which helped alot) and most recently vaginal bleeding. Which I thought was my period back again.  (I haven't had it in 3 years). I've also had vaginal dryness and my gyn has put me on Vagifem.  She says this dryness is common in women post menopausal women.  The bleeding is recent and I called my oncologist who said to stop taking the Arimidex. I had a biopsy which came back benign. Since I've stopped the Arimidex I've lost weight, do not have the vaginal dryness and feel like myself again.  I'm debating going on the Arimidex again.  Anybody else going through this?",4
"As of today I have been on this medication for 4 years, with one more year to go.  I do have bone pain, and it can be a bother when trying to sleep, but Tylenol usually helps.",4
I seem to be having good results with Aimidex and no noticeable side effects except over the months my hair is thinning to the degrees it is obvious. I was not on chemotherapy so that can not be the reason.,5
"I am a two year survivor whoo-ho! had a hysterectomy one year ago due to cysts all over. was on tamxifen before my hysterectomy. i am now in full menopause and on arimidex, i have also been diagnosed with R.A. in the past year. I felt great before breast cancer. now with all the meds i feel like a walking chemistry experiment. I have the joint pain so bad some days i dont even want to get out of bed. being on arimidex has been so hard but what else is there? i dont want cancer to come back, im with you ladies this sucks! i realy thought i was going crazy or worse, cancer was back somewhere else in the body. have two yesr mammo tomorrow and dr. app few days after and am showing him all of your comments because i feel yor pain good luck ladies.   ",3
I have rheumatoid arthritis and had lumpectomy -will get radiation directly to site for 5 days and dr wants me to try Arimedex.  I really don't need more achy joints.  sounds like I should try something else. I am a smoker too and take Zoloft for depression. ,2
Do not like some of the side effects.,4
i have all the aforementioned side effects but worst is the incredible cramps and spasms..they are so painful i am considering stopping this medication,1
"I have not been feeling well, whether it comes from the Arimidex, I dont know. However, I've been bothered by my hair thinning, it's embarrassing! My husband suggested getting off, but I don't know. I would appreciate your suggestions! Debbie, 58",4
"I'm having a problem that I haven't heard mentioned yet.  I'm 57 and suffer from the same side effects as most of you...fuzzy memory, joint pain, hair loss, weight gain...but I haven't seen anyone mention painful intercourse.  I've asked 5 doctors and they all suggest lubrication. That's not the problem.  My cervix doesn't seem to open, so I feel like I'm giving birth in reverse.  I'm wondering if it's from the lack of hormones in my body.  Anyone else having this problem or am I just crazy? ",5
"1YEAR DOWN, 4 TO GO. I ACHE CONSTANTLY, WOULD CRY BUT IT WOULDN'T REALLY HELP. AM 55 BUT FEEL 80,  IF THIS HELPS PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE GREAT BUT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE ALMOST AS BRUTAL AS THE CHEMO AND RADIATION.  WEIGHT GAIN, THIN HAIR, MILD DEPRESSION, FUZZY MEMORY AND THE ""JOYS"" OF WHAT WE GO THROUGH. I TRY TO REMEMBER TO KEEP LAUGHING, IT HAS BEEN THE ONLY REAL AID TO COPE WITH THIS CONDITION. GOOD TO HEAR THIS IS THE ""NORM"" FOR US, AND PLEASE PEOPLE QUIT TELLING US WE NEED TO EXCERCISE AND DIET, UNLESS YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS YOU PROBABLY DON'T ""GET IT""  IT'S NOT THE FLU BUG WE DEALING WITH.  THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE SHARED AND HELPED ME SEE THAT I AM NOT GOING CRAZY.  ",3
Have been taking for over a year. All test so far have been good. No problem with the drug.,5
"my mother at age 81 was placed on this drug after a lumpectomy and radiation - her quality of life seriously deteriorated - before able to dance 2x per week and very lively in conversation - on the drug had bouts of severe flu like symptoms, severe fuzziness & memory loss, and widlely fluctuating blood pressure - off from it now for 6 months and most symptoms have disappeared, hospitalized 2x and no one asked if it might be the armidex causing the symptoms - need to ask questions and keep asking them on any drug",1
Seven years ago I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. After a lumpectomy and radiation tx. I was put on Tamoxifen for several years then changed to Arimidex. Now I experience less side effects/hot flashes and I am a lot more comfortable on Arimidex. I will soon be evaluated by an Oncologist to determine when I can discontinue the Arimidex. I also take Calcium and Vitamin D. My bone density tests show I am in a normal range for my age. ,4
"Have been on Arimidex for about 7 months after 4 years on Tamoxifen. Unlike most of the patients, I did not have breast cancer, but uterine cancer, stage IV, spread to my lungs. Have had one scan in late May and the Arimidex has prevented any growth or spread of the cancer. But I am miserable. It helps to know other women have experienced the same side effects. I was beginning to think it was all in my head. Some days every bone and joint in my body hurts and I am so tired. Especially painful are ankles, feet, and hands. I don't see my oncologist again until Oct. Has anyone found any relief for the pain. I feel like I can't lead a normal life.",4
"I have been on Arimidex for 15 months...weight gain, thinning hair, very tired and very hard to get up from a sitting postiion.  So far so good my tests are negative and I am happy about that part of it.",5
"3 years on Arimidex. Very few side effects.  Weight gain.  My complaint is the cost of the drug.  Medicare Part D stopps in July, when the cost for 30 days tops $200.00!  Any thoughts?  Help!",5
I have been on arimidex fo 3yrs and have had problems with joint pains which has been made bearable with accupuncture offered at our holistic centre my question is how long do I need to take arimidex?,5
"I suppose this medication is doing what it is expected. Its really too soon to tell. The side effects have been horrendous, I feel as if I'm still taking chemotherapy.",2
The only problem has been hot flashes. I have been put on vitaims for that.,4
Have been taking since 2006. Same side effects as mentioned by others but they subsided after about 6 weeks. No major issues now. watch your cholesterol and bone density while on this drug. staying active may help.,4
"It's only been one week since I've taken Arimidex.  I just started radiation treatments on Friday.  Saturday I felt so wiped out it scared me.  I thought, how can I do radiation therapy for six more weeks if I'm this tired from the first dose?  Is this normal, or is the the two things combined at the same time.  Please answer. I had estrogen positve, node negative, Her2 minus, 1.4 cm breast cancer.  Thank you.",3
"Have been on this drug for 3 1/2 years, post lumpectomy and 7 weeks of rads....tumor markers, mamms, and exam remain neg, so drug is doing it's job However, I hurt from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet, knees and hands especially, haven't been able to lose any weight, which would help my knees and hips especially. Still have a lot of fatigue, some days worse than others. Still, I wouldn't even consider stopping the drug, because it's working so well for me. I was relieved to read all the posts and see that other gals are having the same symptoms.",5
"this drug has been hard on my stomach. extreme hot flashes, and very tired for  a 2 hr. period per day. slight hair loss, mainly breakage, and swollen feet and hands, but it beats the alternative.",3
"i have had joint pain,first my lower extremeties,now my upper,shoulder,arm,wrist and thumb pain,,also having mood swings,at times morbid thoughts,weight gain and the not loss of pounds even after excersing 5 to 8 hrs weekly,swimming,,,",3
"I have been taking arimidex now for 6 weeks and have lots of hot flashes, joint and bone pain and weak and tiredness.  I am hoping it will all go away soon which some say it will. It makes it very hard to exercise.  I go to Curves 5 days a week and can barely make it around one circuit.  I was hoping to include walking too but the tiredness I feel now makes that impossible.  I definately will take the drug longer to see if alot of the side effects go away in time.  Thinking very positive here.",3
"I started this drug right after my radiation treatments after surgery in 2006.  After a year I changed to Aromasin because of muscle aches, but didn't see much difference.  So - I went back on Aimidex after my last check up in February.  Muscle aches are my only side-effect.  I can live with that.",4
I have been taking Arimidex for a year and a half and have maintained a healthy diet and exercise. I have experienced no problems with this drug.,5
"I was diagnosed 11/07. Started Arimidex 12/07. Yes, I've gained weight, have all the aches and pains and extreme fatigue but it sure beats chemo or radiation. I feel very lucky so far.",5
"After 5 yrs on Tamoxifen cancer returned a third time.  Did chemo and went on Femara. After 2 years on Femara had blood clots in both lungs probably due to femara since Dr took me off immediately.  Now on Armidex for about 2 years and have many of the problems others have mentioned esp pains and aches in  joints and back, trigger fingers etc.  I feel much older than my 64 years. I'm only staying on because my last tumor was inoperable (between the sternum and aorta) and I don't want the cancer to come back.",4
"I will be taking this medication for five years, I am about 2-1/2 years into it.  So far, so good.  I can't say that it has worked for the entire 5 years, but so far, it has.",5
"Have been on this medication for approx. 2 years.  Along with the muscle pain that others have experienced, I now have something called ""fatty liver"" which was diagnosed by ultrasound because my liver enzymes had increased.  Have rib pain on my right side which makes it difficult to sleep on that side (my favorite) but also frightens me.  My cholesterol level has increased since taking this drug and I cannot take statins because of the muscle pain associated with them. I am trying to lose weight but very difficult.  Eat lots of salads and am hungry all the time.  Oncologist said she has never heard of this side effect from the drug, but I have read that tamoxifin sometimes has this side effect.  Blood is being retested in a month and I hope that enzyme levels are down. I have been taking milk thistle and eating artichokes (without butter of course) which I heard is good for ""fatty liver"". ",4
what benefit is it if you have been treated with tamoxiphen for 5 years - then put on arimidex.,5
I have taken Arimidex for 4 1/2 years with no side effects whatsoever.  My doctor has told me that I could decide whether to contiue taking the drug after five years.  Does anyone have ideas about that? ,5
"I have joint pain, tingling in my hands and feet, occasional sharp pain (like a needle sticking me) in my hands, feet and legs and sometimes elsewhere on my body.  I am embarassed to rub these areas because someone may see me.  Rubbing does help.  Also, if my skin is exposed then, I have more prickly pain, I guess from wind or air conditioning.  While I'm covered up at night, I don't feel the tingling or sharp stabbing pains.  Also am tired all the time but, am starting an exercise program, mostly walking.  I'm up to 2 miles and feel much better because I sleep earlier.  I have occasional headaches that seem to be less frequent and less intense as time goes by.  I have been on Arimidex since March '07.  I also have trouble with weight.  There should be something that can counter the weight gain.  Maybe each of us needs a different dosage of Arimidex.  Maybe we all need to be reassessed.  I think some of us just need to take a pill once a week or once a month, depending on how our well being is, i.e. other health conditions.  If they're giving us the same dosage then, there should be some research for different types of cancers and symptoms.  I think, for me, my Doctor should cut me back on Arimidex, say maybe once or twice a week only.  I'll ask him this week some time.  Just to let you know, most of my symptoms started off pretty intense but, is subsiding with exercise, vitamins, antioxidants, water, milk, yogurt, more vegetables and more rest.    ",5
"after 2 years on arimidex, I had a tia.My  Dr. then took me off of it.",2
"I'm on Arimidex 3 months and NO side effects, I feel great. Just finished 36 radiation treatments. To all of you who have trigger fingers and carpal tunnel: I've had cortisone shots for triggers and surgery for carpal 4 years before I was even diagnosed with cancer. My orthopedic surgeon told me that these conditions are VERY COMMON in postmenopausal women, so the Arimidex may not be the cause.  I feel so lucky that my cancer was diagnosed so early. I had a very small tumor in each breast, needed only lumpectomies and radiation. I also was diagnosed with osteoporosis ten years ago and have been on Fosamax ever since, which my oncologist was happy to hear. I feel so blessed to have had early diagnosis and excellent doctors. I wish you all could feel as well and as lucky as I do. I hope you regain your health and THRIVE!  Bless you all. ",5
"All I can say is I'll be glad when I don't have to take Arimidex anymore.Hot flashes from hell, joint pain, esp.in my hands, weight gain,dizzy, nausea, no sleeping. I feel like I've aged 20 years in the last two...",5
"I've been on this drug for almost five years, and in that time only twice did I experience vaginal bleeding. No other side effects.",5
"I am 53 yrs old. Lumpectomy, radiation & Arimedex for two yrs now. Very active  before using this drug. I have had increasing weight gain, dizziness, falling, dry mouth, headaches, fatigue, blurred vision and most of all painfully swollen joints. I sit here now with my leg propped up with ice packs. I stopped taking arimedex about Jan this year. felt so much better except for joints. Went for my mammogram this week and clusters of calcifications were found in same breast. Biopsy next day. I don't know what to think now. Is this a reprocussion from stopping the drug?? Who knows. I also had a MRI done due to increasing headaches & blurred vision. No sign of cancer but a cluster of blood vessels have ruptured. Not a stroke but was told this was a side effect from chemo which I did NOT have. Very depressing. What next?! I do offer taking effexor for the hot flashes. My hot flashes stopped immeadiately! Ask your Dr. It does work!!! I wish you all well.",3
"Have been on Arimidex for 11 months and hate it.  Symptoms started showing up about 3 or 4 months into treatment.  Bones, joints and muscle pain occur all over with some days worse then others.  Had lower back and hip pain originally which is now worse.  Also insomnia and feet feel like they are on fire all the time.  The Doc took me off for awhile to see if it's really the Arimidex.  Been off for about 4 weeks and see no difference....wondering if it takes longer for the symptoms to disapper?  See the Doc next week and I'm sure he's going to recommend trying another drug (Aromasin) which I doubt will be any better.  Has anyone have had experience with that?",4
"After 4 surgeries, chemotherapy for 4 months and 36 treatments of radiations I expected to feel alot better by this time but I  started this medication six months ago and have had increasing muscle pain to the point it became severe muscle pain especially thighs and calves of legs to the point almost unable to walk. Fatigue, weakness,hot flashes day and night. Stiff joints, fuzzy memory at times, insomnia and feel like I am 100. Maybe even a little depressed from the way I feel all the time. Never any energy. Work full time but it is hard. Am switching to Femara but I think will have the same side effects pretty much.  Can't wait for the 5 years to be up. These meds are affecting my quality of life. Hope my body can stand the course of these medications.  Everyone says ""I look good"" but they cannot really see just how bad I feel. Maybe all the research being done will develop a medication that is effective but with less side effects. We can only hope. That is what I have learned to do best throughout this diagnosis ... HOPE.",4
"Reading these reviews is so helpful. I mainly experience the back, joint, and extremity pain. I have some short term memory problems as well.  Does this go away after treatment? We are so fortunate to have a drug that is quite effective in warding off the return of breast cancer.    ",4
"effective ??  so far, nothing found.  (diagnosis Ca 5/06-chemo, then bilateral mastectomy done). started hell pill 1/07, & counting down the days until 5 yrs is up-weight gain, feeling like 100 yrs old vs. 51 yrs old.  stiff, aching hands & shoulders, esp. after sleep or inactivity. muscle wasting Rt base of thumb, evidence of carpal tunnel, never had before. #2 trigger fingers ( tapeing them straight DID help).  being worked up for rheumatoid arthritis, JUST IN CASE it isn't all the Arimidex. hating it, but sucking it up-feeling old beats being dead from cancer.",3
I have no bother with this drug until now and I have some vaginal Bleeding now after 8 years on Anazotrole..I am to have an Ultrascan of my womb soon. The only side effect has been dryness of Vagina and itching,5
"No problem with hot flashes or joint pain.  Have some muscle weakness and mainly notice it when getting up from chair.  I walk regularly and did yoga for a long period of time after my BC treatment.  I walked in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day 60 Mile Walk last October and was seriously stiff throughout each day's 20 mile walk.  There were no chairs and I hated to sit down in the rest areas since I had to get to the ground and up again.  Sleep is fairly normal now though has been poor during and after chemotherapy.  I haven't gained any weight but until recently haven't been able to lose any of the chemo weight (+17 pnds) either.  Started a low-carb diet 3 weeks ago and have lost 4 pnds to date.  Oncology nurse practicioner at major cancer center recently told me that of all the women she has seen who are on Arimidex, only a handful had not gained weight.  Found it interesting that others had swelling or increased problems with lymphedema because I've noticed some of that as well.   I'm trying to alleviate side effects through exercise, diet, and relaxation techniques (such as massage, yoga, guided imagery).",4
"I have been taking Arimidex for 3 months. Have shoulder, upper arm, chest and breast pain mostly when I awake in the mornings. My hands ache most of the time and have dry mouth in the mornings. Water walking and stretching 4-5 times weekly helps tremendously. It was interesting to read that so many women have the same symtoms that I do. I have an appointment with my oncologist next week who will review my symtoms.  I am aware that all drugs have side effects. Hopefully, these will subside in time. ",3
Taking this med for 3 yrs after radiation. Had left index trigger finger. (relieved to hear others had it too); thinning hair. Had high BP but don't know whether it was because of Arimidex. Now BP very high and referred to cardiologist who did echocardiogram which showed thickened heart muscle. After checking info on internet found some possible causal relationship to heart problem because Arimidex depletes body calcium (for which taking Fosamax and Caltrate with D) also experience lightheadedness which could be heart related or medication. Thanks so much for sharing; very appreciated. God Bless us all. ,4
"I have taken Arimidex for 5 yrs post chemo and radiation.  I read extensively the side effects of both tamoxifen and arimidex before I chose.  The research facts gave better long term results with the arimidex.  It seemed that the earlier research gave joint pain and stiffness as a lesser side effect but I was greatly effected by that as well as the development of osteoporosis.   Both in the morning and after sitting even for a short time period it was difficult to move because of the stiffness.  Still in all it is much better than having cancer again,  I am thankful that it was available.  ",5
"Weight gain, fuzzy brain, joint pain, feet on fire.  Achy back, After 3 years I am afraid what will happen with and without this drug.  I feel old after taking it.  My energy is zapped.  Isn't there anything out there better than this?",1
"What has appeared after 4 1/2 years on arimidex, I have suffered 5 bladder infections in the past 12 months and 3 in the first year. The tests has shown that due to lack of estrogen in my system, it has caused an imbalance in the bacteria which prevents bladder infections.  Otherwise, like the rest, weight gain, joint issues which could go along with my age and not the medication. ",4
no side effects at all,4
"On Arimidex for 3 1/2 yrs. age 64, side effects include trigger finger, wrist & various joint pains, sleeplessness, tiredness & overall muscle aches & pains, have osteopenia, but will continue as planeed for 5 years",5
"Subtle symtoms that seem to get worse as time passes. Hot flashes, joint stiffness, memory loss, sleeplessness, and bouts of vertigo. Have stopped medication for 2 weeks due to dizziness - feel so much better. Will talk to my doctor.",4
"I've just begun my Arimidex treatment. During the first 2 days on the drug, I felt like an Energizer Bunny who had tossed back a handful of ""uppers"" washed down by several cups of strong coffee. Trying to sleep at night was utterly impossible even with over the counter and prescription sleep aids. After 2 days, I emailed my oncologist who suggested I stop for a week, then resume to see if I get the same results. If so, he'll switch me to Tamoxifen or a similar drug. Has anybody else experienced this same crazy thing? I've also experienced moderate diarrhea and some mild dizziness. I'm hoping that whatever drug is substituted will be kinder to my body. ",1
"Have been on Arimidex about half a year, and have it all – fatigue, joint aches and muscle weakness, swelling in hands (can barely get rings on and off), trigger finger, depression, hot flashes bad enough to disturb sleep, elevated triglycerides.  I was in excellent health before this, and my breast cancer was most likely due to abnormal estrogen, i.e. taking the highest dose of hormone replacement for 8 years.  Of course I discontinued the HRT.  In my case, precautionary removal of the remaining small amount of natural estrogen in my system  seems to me to be overkill.  I’ve been told that the risk for me is pretty much reduced almost back to normal (10%) as a result of having gotten pristinely clean margins and the recommended course of radiation.  Next step with oncologist – discuss getting off this, and avoid trying an alternate.  The alternates seem to be just as bad.  The quality of my life is important.",3
"I have been on Arimidex for 4 years. Other than some stiffness in my hands and some weight gain, I've had no side effects. I walk daily and watch my diet. It has been hard to keep my weight down, but well worth the effort. When I found out the obesity is one of the risk factors for breast cancer, I was motived to keep my weight off.",5
is diarrhea a side effect of this drug?,3
I had made a comment before about weight gain after using Arimidex.  I have since been able to lose 25 lbs. by eating a raw veggie salad for dinner with no cheese or eggs and by working up to walking 3 miles per day. The raw veggies are filling and stick with me so I don't feel so hungary. Works for me!,5
"I have many of the symptoms that others have reported - aching muscles and joints, primarily in the legs.  I have difficulty sleeping due to aching muscles and cramps in feet and legs.  I have a trigger finger and hands are very stiff in the morning.  Mobility after setting a long period of time or sleeping is very difficult.  I take extra vitamins and minerals daily, but would like to know if there is anything I can do to offset the pain. ",4
"I have been on Armidex for almost 2 years, when I told my oncologist that I had stopped taking this drug for 2 months he was very upset and told me that it was necessary for me to take Armidex because it would not only help to protect me from breast cancer but also other cancers.  I have learned that this drug is a steroid and that is the reason for the weight and muscle gain.  Also have had trigger finger, and been tierd.  I am also weighing the side effects and feel that it is better to be alive than to stop this drug. Wishing everyone good health.  Michele   ",5
"Have been on Arimidex for 2 months following a L mastectomy. After reading all the other reviews, I consider myself lucky - no bone pain, flashes, etc. However, I have gained almost 15 lbs in these two months. I never had a weight problem before. Asked both my surgeon and oncologist about a connection with Arimidex. Neither gave me anything but a very vague 'watch what you eat answer'. Additional investigation has proved there is better science about the connection between low/no estrogen and weight-gain out there and I should have been told! I could have been pro-active. I'm hoping that weight watchers will help. Otherwise I'll be 500lbs when my 5-year course-of-treatment is over. ",5
"I have been on Arimidex for almost 4 years, I did have trigger finger, and had to have carpal tunnel surgery.  I do get alot of hot flashes through-out the day and night and very tired.  But the cancer has not returned so its a good thing!!",5
"One year ago today I found out that I had breast cancer- awful day. Since finishing chemo & radiation I have been on Arimidex. I have hot flashes all day, can't sleep at night and when I wake up or stand up I hurt all over- mostly in my arms and shoulders and feet. Today I went to my oncologist and he is going to have me try Femara for 1 month and see if the pain is any better. After reading all the comments I am glad I am not alone in this- I agree with the one lady who is going off of it and wants quality not quantity. Good luck to all of you!!",3
"I have taken this drug for 5 years and was finally released from this treatment in Jan.08. I had all of the side effects that others have spoken of on this web site; trigger finger, joint pain, no sex drive, bladder infections, couldn't sleep, hot flashes etc...however I didn't like what the alternative could have been and as each year went by, some of the side effects disappeared; others remained.  The drug was my security blanket and now that I no longer have to take it, I am a little fearful of my cancer returning because hormone receptors are no  longer supressed.  I can't find info on what happens after this treatment is over. This medication has great promise to breast cancer patients even though the side effects are hard to live with. It could never be as bad as chemotherapy and how hard it was on my family.",5
"I am 75 years old & after mastectomy, chemo, radiation  was 3 years on Tamoxifen. I have been on Arimidex for 4 years. Have very bad joint pain, especially in my knees & hands. Fingers swollen & very stiff. Also have serious weight gain that I can't seem to lose. Serious dizziness too. Have been on Actonel about 3 years. So far cancer has not returned and am hoping despite some other side effects from Arimidex, I will still have some quality of life left after I stop taking it.",5
small  side  effects  with  one  exception  i  get a  skin rash  that  comes and  goes..  greatful  for  the  drug.. Thanks,5
"Two years on the drug - experience all the symptoms other readers mention.  Aches, bone pain, memory loss, hair thinning, dry mouth, FATIGUE, drug induced sleep.  ",4
I have been on Arimidex for 5 months and have developed severe pain in my fingers - in the morning my fingers are so stiff I cannot make a fist.  Have developed trigger finger in one thumb as well as carpal tunnel.  I switched to Aromasin for a month with no change in the side effects.  I plan o have a serious conversation with my Oncologist regarding going off this pill.,1
this medication reacted with my stomach and even though I was taking panteloc for acid reflux it was unbearable reflux for 7 days. I had to stop taking it,1
exstreme fatigue,4
"Have been taking Arimidex for about 2 1/2 yrs.  Joint pain and stiffness in AM has subsided somewhat after the first few months.  I have tried to exercise, lift weights, hike, ski, Pilates regularly and would recommend it, because it helps with the stiffness and will help counteract the osteopenia side effect of the drug. Hot flashes, every 1-2 hours and often they wake me up at night. Yes, I have gained about 10 pounds and it does not want to go away!  My main concern are the periods of depression and feelings of my self being gone.  ",5
I have been on Arimidex for 5 months.  The pain in my hands at times is unbearable.  The joints hurt most of the time and three fingers are numb.  I have trouble if I sit to long getting.  The doctor is taking me off the drug and putting me on Tamoxofin.  I am not sure I want this drug either.,4
"My Dr. took me off of Arimidex after two years because of knee and lower leg muscle pain.  Felt like I was an old woman, trouble getting up from chair & walking long distances.  Because symtoms did not go away after two months off of drug, the Dr. does not think it is the Arimidex but may be arthritis.  But it does not feel like ""bone"" pain. For anyone going off of drug, how long did it take for side effects to improve?",4
"I have been on Arimidex for 6 months now to treat IVL. I do have joint pains in the morning when I get out of bed. However bone loss is a reknown side effect of the drug that is why my Dr recommends I take 3 caltrate pills a day.  I also started working out, lifting weights to prevent any bone loss and make sure I follow a healthy diet. What really bothers me are the hotflashes but would rather live with those than not live at all.",4
Arimidex over a 3 yr period turned me into an invalid. Joint pain everywhere and allergic reactions that sent me to ER four times.I could stand only 3 minutes when I finally stopped taking.Not worth your life.,4
High blood pressure - never had before. Numbness in feet intensified. Weight gain. Increased swelling in left arm. Severe hip pain. Headaches. Depression,3
"Used for almost 6 months after 3 and 1/2 unpleasant years on tamoxifen.  This drug was worse,--constant pain, tingling and swelling in hands and feet, and joint aches, especially elbows and hips.  Killed sexual response. My mood was all over the place.  Arimidex made me feel 80 years old although I am a fit 54.  The final straw was my hair falling out in clumps with every shampoo.  Ridiculous, but I just didn't want to deal with that again after losing all my hair during chemo.  Switched to Femara recently,--hair loss has stopped, but other side effects are no better.",5
"I have been taking Arimidex for 9 months. I thought I was having no side effects, but reading the other posts I am wondering if this is what is causing my leg/joint pain and weakness. I am 48, have trouble getting up out of a chair or up from a squatting position, like another post says I feel like an 80-year-old woman. In the morning my feet hurt and I am very stiff and sore. Sometimes my entire body aches. Also trouble sleeping for the first time ever. I am going to talk to my oncologist!",3
"After one year I fell and broke 3 bones, two in my ankle and one in my wrist.  Two years later I have broken my ankle again and have now discontinued arimidex.  I had osteopenia before I began and have had significant bone loss since. ",4
"I didn't sleep for a year, average 2 hrs a night.  My sympathic nervous system never shut off.  I am finally sleeping again, but I have body pain from the waist down. Muscle and joint aches bad in the legs with my feet getting numb.  The doctor's don't know what to do about side effects and the drugs they give you just have other side effects. So, I am avoiding anything except asprin.  Some days I am in tears the pain is so bad.  I have been on arimidex for 2 years.  I am not sure how much longer I can stay on it.  I have no signs of a reoccurance and feel confident I won't. I'm not sure it's armindex, who knows.",4
"1 year after 2 years of Tamoxifen. Rare achiness relieved by drinking 2 glasses of water. No side effects! Be active, eat right - most of the time! and maintain a healthy weight. and drink LOTS of water!",5
"My experience with Arimidex has been a very painful experience.  I have constant burning, numbness and tingling in my feet.  I just been diagnosed with a mass on the outside of my uterus.  I had an ultra sound today, but won't know for several days of the outcome.  I feel it is from taking Arimidex.",2
"After about two months of taking Arimidex, I started experiencing severe joint pain and weakness in my hands and arms and three of my fingertips in my right hand have gone numb.  I have been off of the Arimidex for three months and most of the symptoms have gone away, except for the numbness in my fingers.  I ended up having a carpel tunnel decompression surgery last week.  My hand surgeon told me that he sees a lot of people that have had similar hand and joint problems from taking Arimidex.  I'm so glad I stopped!",2
"First side effect,knee joint pain and weakness. Oncologist repeatedly insisted it was not related to Arimidex, so I went through knee injections (Synvisc)and lengthy Physical Therapy.Also had severe low back pain. Therapy in water finally helped ease both. When thumb joints got very painful I began getting cortisone injections. I stopped Arimidex at 3 1/2 yrs. Wish I had stopped sooner! I have just had my second thumb joint replacement this year. Both my breast surgeon and my hand surgeon believe that Arimidex may well have been responsible for my joint disintegration. What good is a ""promise"" that a drug will keep you safe from the reoccurance of cancer, if your quality of life is taken away?",3
Shortly after starting arimidex I started noticing discomfort in my joints.  Has anyone else hadthis experience. I'm told that this is just one of the side effects.  Is this common for my age?,5
"Since starting this medication I have experienced pain in every part of my body.Seems to be moving around.  First, very bad lower back pain then changed to upper arms and shoulders.  Have difficulty putting on a sweater or coat.  Hot flashes have been ok recently -only 1 or 2 a day. Since September have been upping my dose of fish oil capsules (2 a day) and also using flaxseed oil on my oatmeal.  This seems to have helped the pain somewhat. Also take Vitamin B6.  As others have said have gained weight, have fatigue and don't always sleep too well.  My cholesterol level also jumped 20 points in 2 months after taking Arimidex.  I eat lots of fruits and vegetables so this should not happen.  I don't want to take statins for this condition because it has caused muscle pain in the past and with all the aches and pains I have with Arimidex don't need more.",4
"I have been taking Arimidex for just over 4 years. I show no signs of recurrence. I had severe arthritis-like pains at the start of my treatment, and suffered two fractures from falls which shouldn't have caused fractures. My pain went away when I started taking Actonel for osetopenia, and I haven't fractured anything since then. ",5
"I've been on this med for 2 months and it feels like years. The side effects are very unpleasant.  I've had many but most disappear in a short period of time.  Those that I'm still having cotton mouth, weight gain, water retention and limbs swelling, joint & shin pain, nasty yeast infection and sore mouth (inside upper lip feels scalded), difficulty sleeping.  I'm taking Trazodone as sleep aid/anti-depressant.  ",5
"I have only been on this for about 2 months. Before that it was Tamoxifen.  I have severe hot flashes. 15 to 20 daily even on the Effexor.  I have muscle and joint pain in the morning.  Brest tenderness,weight gain, sleeplessness. I am on Ambien for that, but still wake up 2-4 times a night with hot flashes.",3
I have noticed hair thinning and am not sure if the drug is the cause.,4
"I have been on the drug for 2 years.  I experience; memory loss, weight gain, sore joints, hot flashes (2-4 daily) and sleeplessness.  I take effexor to counteract the hot flashes.  Without effexor, I would have 10-15 hot flashes daily.  Effexor also works as an anti depressent.  It reduces hot flashes and your happier.  Not a bad trade off.  It works. . . I am thankful.  I am a second generation brest cancer survivor.  And plan to stay that way.  ",5
I have been on this drug for almost 2 years and have not had any problems except for some swelling in my legs.,4
"You do it because you are told it is good for you.  All your joints ache, can't sleep, diarrhea, constipation, no memory, hot flashes, weight gain and not able to lose it.  Can't get an insurance policy because you have to still take a medication as treatment, even though the medicine is supposedly preventing a recurrance.  I quit and feel so much better.  I'm living for quality not quantity now.  ",4
"I have been on Arimidex for three years now and I am very grateful the cancer has not recurred.  I want to thank everyone for their comments.  I have gained a lot of weight and when I asked my oncologist if Arimidex caused weight gain,he said ""Not really""  From the comments it seems I am not the only one.  My last blood tests showed my glucose was above normal and my cholesterol too which I think is from the weight gain.  Also I have osteopenia which is a side effect of Arimidex. Now I am on Boniva for that. I am grateful for the drug but will be happy to finish the 5 year treatment and I hope I am not ruining my health in other areas.",5
I HAVE BEEN ON ARIMADEX FOR 3 YEARS.. IT HAS WORKED FOR ME.. THANKS!!!! DEBBIE CHISOLM,5
"as a woman w/ ""MMMMT""( carcinosarcoma),(uterine cancer),i don't recommend any hormonal therapy,or hornone therapy- like drugs.i believe after 5 yrs.of tamoxifen & 4 yrs.of Evista(hormone therapy)it has sentenced to me a cancer that only 2-5% of all women get,with a very low expectancy.",2
"I know I can deal with all the sideffects, as long I am cancer free. I am waiting for the day I am able to loose the 20pounds I have gain, and also regaing my libido. I sounds like I am not the only one. We just have to pray the the cancer does not return. No garentees in this world",5
"I am an 8-year breast cancer survivor. After a mastectomy and 6 months of chemo, I took tamoxifen for 5 years,and then was switched to armimidex these last 3 years. Even though I know this medication is helping in keeping the cancer at bay, the side effects of weight gain and total loss of libido are difficult to deal with. And my skin is like shoe leather. ",5
I've taken this for three years.  I've gained weight and have a loss of libido. I had early stage breast cancer in both breasts.,4
"this drug has done wonders for the migraines that I have had for 50 years, once a month. Since I have taken Arimedix for breast cancer preventative, the migraines have stopped completely.  My migraines were estrogen induced and that is the reason that the drug has worked so well for me. Thankyou",5
This drug gave me osteoporosis and made me feel like I was 20 years older.,3
"Very dry mouth, very sore joints especially hips and lower back, sweat all the time with little to no exertion. Over all bone pain, diffuculty sleeping.  The only good thing thus far is that I am still cancer free, 3 years after 6 chemo treatments (TAC) & 40 round of radiation.",5
"I've been on Arimidex for 5 years.  My oncologist wants to put me in a study where I would continue the drug for another 5 years.  The probpem is that I have an existing heart problem (mitral valve prolapse and the ejection fraction has been reduced within the past couple of years)-- coupled with a lung condition.  My pulmonary doctor tells me that I have chronic emphasyma (I never smoked).  I think that the radiation therapy, after chemo, didn't do my lungs any good.  I've had weak lung tissue for years and had pneumothorax on the right and left side and had surgery on both of them. Needless to say, I have tried, in vain, to find more extensive information on arimidex.  When it lists the side effects of Airmidex,lung and heart problems are just two of them.  I have other side effects, but the heart and lungs are my main concern--especially if they want me to continue this drug..  My breast cancer affected five of my lymph nodes.    I would like to know, exactally, how  or what this drug does, specifically, to the lungs and heart.  I hope you can help.  Thank you for your time.   Mary",5

"bad side affects trigger finger.pain and swelling in both wrist and hands, insomnia, fatigue.",4
"I have been on Arimidex for just over a year and have experience basically no side effects. The only issue I have is my left hand and fingers tingle occasionally at night - enough to waken me, however, the doctor thinks it has more to do with Carpel Tunnel Syndrome - which I never had before. I am going to be 70 years old soon, am in excellent health and shape as I work with a personal trainer. I am very happy to buy the drugs from(bonhoa.com) Bonhoa Pharmacy. Life is Good!",5
"I started this drug  August 2007 and will finish my treatment August 2012. I am in remission so Arimidex has worked for me.I cant wait for treatment to end as I have had a great deal of weight gain acid reflux and lots of aches and pains all over my body, but at least I am still alive.",5
"I'm 4 years and 10 months ""into"" this medication so should be off it in November 2011.  I've watched my diet but have still gained 20 pounds and feel very bloated.  Am hoping that will end soon.  ",5
"I've been on arimidex since May of 2007.  I'm hoping to be off it by May of 2012.  I've gained about 25 excess lbs.  With out trying.  I've been told that once off it, my weight should go back to normal.  I can only hope so.      ",5

"I have recurrent ovarian cancer, 9 years out from diagnosis.  I have tiredness, heavy legs but none of this keeps me from doing most of what I want to do.  My tumor is growing slowly now but for several years (2-3 years) I was stable.  I get the medication in bottles so don't have the bubble wrap problem.  My legs also have neuropathy from previous chemo and so I don't know what's from the Arimidex and what is from previous chemos.  ",5
"Thank you everyone for writing, I'm glad I'm not alone. I have virtually the same symptoms: I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years-  Fatigue.  Joint stiffness and pain,  Excruciating leg cramps almost nightly,  Getting depressed, although I am usually a very positive person,  Having a great deal of trouble with my memory- I am at the point where I worry about alzheimers.  Hot flashes continue, although they are not quite as bad as a year ago.  Am post-menopausal, and look like I aged 10 years in the last 2... Weight gain: just a few pounds. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am trying to stay hydrated- drink tonic for the quinine and bananas for the potassium, because I think the leg cramps are from dehydration, lack of sleep causes fatigue and depression. Very slight improvement. Any other ideas out there? Thanks",5
"I have been on Arimidex for 1 yr.  Legs feel like bricks (stiff & heavy), gaining weight w/edema,  fatigue, and depression.  Thankfully, I do not have the hot flashes.",4
"I've had several of the side effects, headache,bronchitis,hot flushes and vaginal dryness.Just hoping I'll feel better soon.",4
"All in all this medication has not bothered me particularly, but I am having trouble with constipation and some depression.  I just wondered if this drug could be causing some of this.",1
"have been taking arimidex for approx. 6 mos. don't know what the other people are talking about but mine comes in a container not a bubble pack. have had several leg and hand cramps and a few hot flashes but overall I'm not complaining. my only problem is waiting for it to go generic in the U.S. at these prices my $2000 deductible gets eaten up quickly. does anyone know for sure when this is going to happen, I'd been told Feb. 2010!",4
my tumors are shrinking,3
I have been taking Arimidex for 2 1/2 years  have 2 1/2 to go. Have no side effect.,5
"This has been a very difficult medication to use. The pain it has caused has been horrible, especially the bone and joint pain. I have had shortness of breath, depression, confussion, memory loss, insomnia, extreme fatigue anxiety, tingling and numbness in hands and feet, and now arthritis in both knees and need surgery for damage in knees as well. I can't imagine taking this for 4 more years. Quality of life is more important than longevity to me. I am going to quit taking this as soon as I consult my doctor. The package is rediculous!Who came up with this anyway? Longevity at what cost?",3
"the pain in my legs and overall body aches are wicked been on it for two months, tumors seem to be shrinking. i hope it works",2
"have been on this med for one yr. about 2 wks ago woke up with sever stiffness in fingers, tried to straighten out fingers, middle finger locked, also right thumb,extremely painfull. my cancer doc. said it and my other aches and pains not from meds,i beg to differ from him. i get meds from drug com.no ins. used to get those horrible packs. kept requesting bottle finely did. ask,no demand!",4
"I had taken this medication for 5 yrs. Had hot flashes in the first few months, then got better. Lower back pain,caused from degenerating lower disk..Not sure if its caused from this meds?? It's better then tamoxafin and the other one thats out there. good luck, do your homework, it pays off in a long run. God bless",4
"I had my right breast removed Feb.01,2008. I have been on this drug for 10 months. I have had very little pain until the last few weeks, and It gets worse every day !! Ache from my waist to my feet,extream pain !! I just hope I can stay on it, to keep the cancer from feeding off my overies. I do not for the life of me know who in the world came up with that package. Don't they know we have problems with our poor arms? Way to much hard work to try and get one darn pill. This package has to be a flop. ",5
"The Arimidex is doing its job in keeping the breast cancer from coming back but the joint pain is horrendous. I am 55 years old. My doctor started me on Lyrica, which has almost totally blocked the pain thank God, but when I forgot to take it for three days, extreme joint pain came back. Started Lyrica again and the pain is now gone.   I despise the bubble pack. I don't have any arthritis, etc., but it is impossible to get that tiny tablet out of that bubble. I have to use a pen to poke the tablet out and it is really aggrivating to have to do this. Why can't the tablets just come in a bottle like other meds do.  God bless you all Sisters, and I hope that you remain in recovery and live life to its fullest. ",4
Took arimidex for 7 months. I had a very hard time sleeping and had hot flashes. I kept trying to fight depression but because of my extreme lack of sleep I decided to stop taking arimidex. I'm sleeping better and my depression has gone. I thank God!,3
"I am 64 and have had extreme pain in my hands, wrists and knees since starting Arimidex last March(2008).  I have had all kinds of blood tests and x-rays of my joints. I have osteoarthritis now.  I also detest the new bubble packaging. I have to use a knife to get the pills out.  I also remove 7 pills at a time and put them in a weekly pill reminder.  I can't imagine another 4years on this medication.  I can't move now.",3
IT'S BEEN ONLY 1 1/2 YRS SINCE I BEGAN THIS MED.THE PACKAGE IS VERY HARD TO OPEN.I'M 62 AND HAVE AN INCREASE OF ARTHRITIS PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY SINCE BEGINNING.NAUSEA AND HEADACHE ARE CONSTANT,3
I am 44 ys old and I have had Breast Cancer twice and 6 different surgeries before the masteomey and this drug has given me mood changes from anger to sadness to being happy for no good reason. Plus the night sweats and the constantly being thirsty from being dehydrated from sweating so much. The memory loss is severe I feel like I'm an old lady,3
"I am in my fifth year on this med.  Due to my age, I don't know if the joint pain is age related (63) or a result of the med.  The new packaging is a problem.  I simply tore it totally apart to get to the foil.  I punch  a week's supply out and put them in a daily med container.  The foil is very thin!  Put the remainder (in foil blister  pack) back between the trifold package.  I would like to be able to continue Arimidex after 5 years...",5
"I have been cancer free for 2.5 years.  Only side affects has been the hot flashes. I detest the new bubble pack, if it wasn't for my husband using his tin snips to cut open the package, I would have to switch to another medication.",4
"The joint pain in my feet and angles is rough after sitting or getting out bed. I have a 4 yr old to keep up with so, debating whether to switch to Tamoxifen and risk uterine cancer and blood clots. Hate the package, wrist and finger tips hurt from the very hard bubbble to push pill through. Didn't know about the mood swings, that would explain my sudden outbursts.",5
I also don't care for the new package.  The hot flashes I have now are worse than they ever were during menopause.  I was unaware that joint pain was a side effect.  That sure explains alot.  I just wonder what happens after the '5' year time is up?,3
i had breast cancer 4 years later i got lung cancer i was on tamoxfin new dr put me on this med and now one and half years later cancer is in reminsion i am stiff but thats a small price to pay instead of lung cancer i thank god and my dr for this med ,5
I had tamoxifen for 5 years with no side effects and now I'with arimidex I gained 10 pounds wake up with stiff joints and I'm extremly dry (all over).,3
"3.8 years Survivor of Stage 3a Breast Cancer, I have taken Armidex for 3 years. PM I woke up stiff and hurting, I change to AM and keep moving getting ready for work.  I do have mild leg pain from it but to me it tells me it's working to keep the cancer AWAY.  ",5
hot flashes returned,4
I have very little problems with Arimidex.  I do experience stiffness so I do not appreciate the new packaging although it is nice to have each pill marked consecutively with the name of a day.  I have some moody days but they seem to be occurring less & less.  I have been on this drug for about a year now.  I actually was able to lose 5lbs. with some dieting. Strenuous exercising helps me clear my mind and helps me to have a feel-good day.,5
It almost killed me.I still have trouble walking.The leg pain is so bad.How long will it take to leave the body.It was the worst thing ever.,1
"I have been cancer free one year now however, I find it hard getting out of bed I hate to go any where as I am so tired plus I have gained over 30# my joints hurt all the time. What is a person to do. Jeri Moore",5
"I have only been on Arimidex for four months so I cannot rate its effectiveness.  I am, like so many others, experiencing extreme fatigue. The new packaging is so very difficult to open.",4
"I have severe joint pain, I have gained 30+ pounds in 6 mos., night sweats, and nervious/shakey, hate the package.",4
The new packaging adds insult to injury for those of us who suffer from painful and stiff joints as a side-effect.  It is a real struggle to remove the pills from the package.  ,3
"My problem is not with the medication itself, but with the new package.  For those of us who have stiff joints, it is almost impossible to get to the pills.  If I cannot go back to the bottles, I will have to ask my doctor to prescribe another medication.",5
"I am worried about the side effects,such as joint pain and weight gain. Have only been taking it for 4 months and have none of this so far ,except for a few hot flashes.",5
"I thought it was just me having all the same side effects. Muscle and joint pain is so horrible I can barely get out of a chair. No sleep, weight gain, sweating beyond hot flashes. Literally, it's hard to do my hair because it's wet from sweating after I blow dry it. Sex drive...gone. Completely. Emotional too. When I get up in the morning I can hardly walk my feet hurt so bad. I think I'm going to stop taking it.  I'm only 56. This is no way to live. Anastozole was worse. And I get vertigo a lot. ",1
"Was on arimadex 3. 1/2 yrs. Bad joint pain weight gain. Higher blood pressure.  Started aromasin last week. Killing my stomach, bloating miserable.  I asked my oncologist to check my hormone levels he said it would not be accurate.  I had stage 1 lobular no lympnodes involved. Plus its expensive. I'm done. Will consider arimidex on and off. Quality if life important.  I'm constantly second guessing my self.  ",3
"I had severe issues with bone pain and many nights of not sleeping.  After a year of trying and not improving, I have been switched to Tamoxifen.  Praying for better times and no breast cancer",5
"I had a mastectomy and started aromasin.  My lymph nodes were clear.  I have had a tough time with this drug.  Hot flashes, hands joint pain where I sometimes can't use a few fingers or they lock up, bladder issues where I feel I need to go but I do not have any bladder infections. Also had an issue with hearing and leg cramps but those 2 problems went away.  I took aromasin about 2 months and stopped.  It has been 2 months since I stopped and still having hot flashes, joint pain and bladder problems.  My surgeon and oncologist say aromasin is out of my body and the issues are not related to the drug,  REALLY?  I did not have any of these problems before the drug.  My family doctor thought kidney infection and I have tried 3 different antibiotics with no relief.  I am now taking an anti-spasm drug for the bladder problems.  I am also putting out white cells in my urine but no infection. My doctor ordered lab tests and everything was normal and my rheumatoid factor was negative (oncologist said I have arthritis which I know I don't). I feel this drug caused damage to my bladder and joints but most (not all) doctors, nurses and even pharmacist say no and the drug only lasts in my body 60 hours and the side effects would have been gone in 2 weeks.  A few doctors said it is possible there is damage from the drug and it may take months to heal and one said maybe the pain never will go away.  My oncologist wants me to try something else but as long as I feel this bad I refuse to take anything else.  ",3
My mother got breast cancer. So ordered aromasin from buybirthcontrolpills dot com from where we can get complete range of women health medicines.,5
I ordered Aromasin for treating my cancer and got it from buybirthcontrolpills dot com,5
I am only 6 weeks into this medication and I can't fall asleep or stay asleep if I do fall asleep. I sometimes have chest discomfort and have to take a few deep breaths to feel normal. Hot flashes like crazy during the first few hours after taking. My appetite is off and I am not hungry at normal times of day. This is throwing my glucose readings all out of whack. Not sure how long I will stay on this med before trying a different one.,3
This medication is unbearable. My family insists that it is the right thing but the pain and depression is so bad.i have told my Dr. But she looks at me like I am crazy.  Don't know if I can stand it much longer.,1
"I was diagnosed in Oct 2014, had a lumpectomy and 7 weeks of radiation.  I was first prescribed Arimidex which I could not tolerate.  I was so dizzy I could not get out of bed.  I was then prescribed Aromasin and was fine for a couple of months and then started to experience stomach distress and now I have chronic diarrhea.  I can't leave the house if I have had anything to eat that day.  I have a colonoscopy scheduled just to be on the safe side, but I really believe that my problem is the Aromasin.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?  ",3
"The muscle/joint pain is excruciating.  It is to the point of intolerance.  Also, my alk. phos has been elevated which has prompted me to stop this drug and seek further options.  I can't remember the last time I slept through a night on this medication.",1
"I was diagnosed with stage 1 node negative in October 2013 had  lumpectomy, chemo then radiation   I was then put on tamoxifen for about 4 mths with no side effects. My oncologist then changed it to ariimidex was on it for a year. The pain became so bad he took me off of it. Now I took aromasin for four days and was rushed to er. I now have a lump on my collarbone has anyone experienced this.  Please post if anyone has any info. Thanks ",1
"I was diagnosed with stage I breast cancer and it had gone outside the ducts.  I had a lumpectomy and four weeks of radiation.  My oncologist put me on Anastrozole.  After two weeks the side effects were typical of what has been described by others so she switched me to aromasin.  This drug proved to be even more negative.  The newest side effect was chest pain and trouble breathing.  Also I was recently diagnosed with a dilated ascending aorta.  That is ""new to me"" as I have always been a very healthy person.  Of course it could be age and genetics but I have my doubts.  Radiation on my right breast and drugs seem to have the potential for damaging the heart.  I realize the likelihood of damage to the right breast is less.  Regardless  I am off the meds for a while.  Just not worth it.  I will see my oncologist when I return from Florida i the Spring.  It chest pains persist will see a cardiologist here.  Yes, these drugs save lives and I am not a baby.....just not willing to live like this.",2
"Started this drug in June 2015 after chemo, bilateral mastectomy, radiation.  Initially was prescribed Anastrozole and had too many debilitating side effects.  Oncologist then prescribed Aromasin and what a difference.  The joint pain, bowel issues, massive hot flashes on this drug are nothing compared to the other. I already had osteoarthritis, so that pain has been relieved with Celebrex and walking every day.  I haven't gained any weight, yet my waistline has completely disappeared.  Hopefully, it will all be worth it.  It costs a fortune, over $300 a month.  ",3
"I was given Tamoxifen and then Arimidex and now Aromasin. I was diagnosed 3 years ago and have been on and off these medicines because of the side effects. They have all been terrible. WHat good is living if you can't enjoy life because of the side effects of these medicines. With Aromasin, it first appeared as if it was going to be okay. However, after a few months all the side effects started and they just keep coming. The joint/muscle and bone pain is almost unbearable. I gained 1o pounds, am extremely fatigued and have no ambition. I have fractured my elbow in 3 different places (haven't had a fracture since middle school), and the hot flashes never stop. About 1.5 months ago I had vaginal bleeding and I have had a hysterectomy. NO one knows what caused that. The latest side effect  the depression - is probably the worse. This came on a few weeks ago and has become severe. So severe in fact I stopped taking it today. I am calling my doctor to let them know. I have never in my life experienced depression and for it to be as bad as it is (crying all the time, moode swings, even thoughts of siuicide ), to me- makes it not worthwhile.  I will go back to clean eating, and lots of exercising. IN my opinion I would rather do this naturally, feel good and take my chances. I want to enjoy any amount of time I may have left with my family, and I want to be able to do it pain free. I wish all of you the best and prayers are with everyone who must suffer from cancer and all the medicinal aspects of treatments. I urge you all to research natural alternatives rather than suffer. I will continue",3
"In discussing whether this medication has worked, I do not know as it has only been a few months. How will I ever know anyway?! One thing I do know is that I gained 8.4 pounds in the first two weeks of taking it even though cutting down on food after the first couple pounds were put on. The study shows how many people gain more than 10% of their body weight, but talks nothing about weight gain less than that. I would have to gain 14 pounds in order to be in that category >10%, but I am now eating less than 900 calories a day just to maintain the weight gain I already gained. I have not experienced any joint pains that I thought I would because of my existing conditions of arthritis. For that I am glad! The weight gain needs to definitely be addressed by the company or at least explained more fully because at 140 pounds I should not even gained 5 pounds let alone 14 pounds.  Their "">10%"" misleads doctors and patients into believing there is only a small number of folks affected by weight gain.  That is quite possibly because of folks like me that have all but stopped eating to just maintain the gained weight...so that we never reach the 10% category!",1
"I can barely type. Joints are stiff I feel Cancer would be easier to deal with .. I am 35 can't get out of be my knees lock. Omg this is horrible.. Headache, depression can't sleep.. Hell.. ",1
"I took Arimidex for 3 months and finally changed to Aromasin . This is my second year of Aromasin and the side effects I find most intolerable are the lack of energy and depression. I stopped the drug for the month of August and regained my energy level and mood elevation. In the middle of December , I stopped it again. I've now restarted it and take it daily. Needless to say my oncologist is not in agreement with my routine. I will say the swollen hands & feet, hot flashes,achy joints & brain fog diminished after taking it for 1 year.I also monitor my diet closely and have eliminated soy and other hormone prone foods. Hang in there, it could be worse. ( I haven't tried kelp, if side effects worsen, I'll give it a try.)",5
"I was taking tamoxifen after I first had breast cancer when my breast cancer came back I was first placed on armidex. I had a horrible time with bone pain,fatigue,nausea and diarrhea. The worst problem was the devastating depression and anxiety. It got so bad all I wanted to do was cry. I was afraid to leave my house. I called my Dr,she told me that these were not side effects from the armidex. I told her that I since stopped taking armidex for a week and I was feeling better already. She reluctantly agreed to put me on aromasin, within a week the side effects started up again. I already have the knees of a 89 year old,according to my orthopaedic surgeon and I to get both knees replaced. I can't spend the rest of my life like this. I'm 48 now and she wants me to stay on this medication for the rest of my life. I read in someone's comment that their Dr said what is more important the quality of your life or quantity. I'm going for quality!!! With all the other side effects from this medication I would probably die from a stroke before cancer,if my Dr would look at all my other risk factors maybe she would see that. My husband says that it's their job,the Dr,to push these medications down our throats. I'm beginning to believe him and I've been a nurse for over 20 years. I'm going to tell my Dr it's my body and it's my choice!!",1
"After Stage 3 aggressive Breast Cancer Surgery including removal of 3 Nodes underwent Chemo & Radiotherapy concluded in 2012 & placed on Femara till Easter 2013 . Side effects intolerable & completely immobilised me but Depression was the worst. Was alive but didn't want to be. Took myself off it at Sister's urging and later in month Onco placed me on Aromasin for 5 years. Ok @ 1st but now not sleeping, tingling & numbness in fingers & hands. Joint pain, particularly in knee joints, back pain, tiredness, inability to walk far independently increasing. Now avoiding going out - not like me! Quality of life rapidly deteriorating! Will try to make Onco appointment but can't see there's any other solution. Is this the only alternative to preventing return of Cancer?",2
"This pill, aromasin has been a godsend to me.  The other meds I took had me bedridden for 2 years.  Because I had breast cancer twice in the same breast and refused Tamoxifen, My choices are limited.  But Aromasin has saved me.  I take a calcium pill that is timed over the day and releases  thruout, that was the only thing I forgot in the beginning of taking it, but now i'm settled with that.  I have gotten heavy, but heck, being alive is worth it.  I don't have anymore choices, but am so glad that this aromasin is working so well.  I'm 65 next week, and I honestly didn't think I would make it, but this god saver of a pill has me happy again.  If this doesn't work for you, switch.  I had a friend that took aromasin and switched to aromadex and is better with that.  It was the aromadex that tormented me for 2 years.  We all have different body make-ups, search for your life saver.  Godspeed.",5
"I am also taking Aromasin for post breast cancer care.  Like a lot of others, the side effects have included joint pain.  For someone who plays piano and golf, the pain in my hands was miserable.  However, I started taking kelp to help offset some of these symptoms, and it has helped immensely.  In fact, any residual pain can be relieved with Advil.  Hope this tidbit helps someone.",4
"Started Aromasin 25mg in August 2013...took until March 2014...Have iritable bowel..still..tingling,numbness, exacerbates Raynaud syndrome and Carpal tunnel. Had three nose bleeds..unable to sleep...anxiety..My oncologist was recently informed I have stopped. Went over my specific history and clinical findings..said the side effects out weigh the benefit of taking it. I had a pre-cancer dx Ductal Ca..however, due to that i am at high risk for new cancer. But, for now so far last mammo and mri are negative. Will discuss with my surgeon next..oncologist did offer me Tamoxifen...I'm thinking of it..not sure.",2
"I began estrogen blockers in Jan 2013, went thru Arimidex, & Femmara, switched to Aromasin 9 months ago. All three give me joint pain to the point if I sit for more than 15 minutes. I have to push myself up to get out of my chair, etc.  Hot flashes, anxiety and now I have 'Hormonal Therapy Brain"".  Memory loss, I've nearly overboiled water four or five times, for tea to the point, the pot is half empty. I was having a discussion with a co-survivor, and totally lost the two words I was trying to say. Have forgotten to close the garage door a dozen times in the last few weeks. So, good news is Acupuncture has really helped with my joint pains, hot flashes and anxiety. I'm anxious to see if Acupuncture will help with the ""chemo/aromasin"" brain challenges. Good Luck to all of you.",5
"This drug has been pretty hard on my joints. I have been taking it for a little less than one year and I feel as though I have aged 20 years in that time frame. I limp, my hands are like claws in the morning when I wake up and I had some breathing problems from time to time. I have hot flashes (not really too bad there) and I am feeling tired much of the time and brain fog is really bad as well. My blood pressure which was always good has gone up a little and now I am pre-hypertensive and on the borderline to take BP medication. Not thrilled with this little pill to say the least but I am terrified not to take it due to being >95% ER+...ugh! Between a rock and a hard place as they say. Just praying it was all worth it and I don't have a recurrence! ",4
"I got breastcancer in 2012, operation, kemotheraphie and radiotherapie. I startet with aromazin desember 2012, after 6 week I got terrible pain in my right hand, swollen fingers and they find our that I got Carpal tunnelsyndrom, they stop the treatment 3 weeks, startet again and the sit.okey. But after 10 days I got tinnitus in right ear with redused hearing. Onkolog sand it could not be Aromasin, but I cut out the drug after living with this problem inn early 3 months to see if...and after 10 days the tinnitushell disapeared, thank God! ! Now I have startet the drug again and what I feeli now is pain in the joints, shoulder, neck and fingers swollen, sleepless. I have desided to keep on the 4 year I have left with the drug. I dont want to Get the cancer back! Thank you out there for sharing your experience, it gives  me  courage to keep on.",2
"I was diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast cancer-ductal carcinoma in situ, not invasive,  August 2013, after annual mammogram, repeats, biopsy. I had 2 surgeries in Sep 2013, removed duct and tissue, margins clear and the surgeon wanted to make sure nothing was hiding so she took out more tissue, no nodes taken, no cancer seen.  I had 20 radiation treatments. The medical oncologist put me on aromasin to  help prevent the cancer from returning since they said i was healthy and want me to stay that way and they said the side effects were minimal with the drug. I started it Dec 1,  have had nite sweats, have them during the day, joints ache, my left leg and left shoulder hurts- can't always carry a purse or anything in left arm. I sometimes feel a slight brain fog. I have occasional dizziness, queasy stomach, bloating, trouble sleeping some nites,some depression, irritability. I hope no more effects happen. I see the oncologist in a few days, and i need to get a bone scan done. I am not sure if the drug is worth taking or not. I don't want to get more side effects the other ladies described. The stage 0 breast cancer was a shock. I don't know if i should take it after only having stage 0 and not invasive cancer,and i do get yearly mammograms and take care of myself. I am now 59 and don't want to age faster or become more sick with the side effects. Am not sure what is the best thing to do. Maybe taking more vitamins may help, am already on Vit D, calcium, multivitamin. Was not able to really rate with the stars as have only been on aromasin almost 6 weeks (is expensive, but insurance pays for it so far). will keep using until see dr and get advice.",3
"It causes me pain in my joints. I worry about the long-term effects. I have difficulty with some tasks and when I feel the pain, I feel very tired. I have wondered about alternatives, and also about how long I really need to take this. I am coming up on 3 years in a few months.",3
"I have been taking aromasin for four months to treat hormone receptor positive recurrent ovarian cancer.   The latest ct-scan showed some of the cancer slightly improved and some of the cancer slighty worse.   The side effects have been incredibly difficult to manage.   The bone and muscle pain is intense, causing me to lose sleep, and have much difficulty managing my life.   Plenty of fatigue and inability to concentrate or function.    Over the past four months the symptoms have increasingly gotten worse. I am trying to stay on this med for another three months, but I am not sure that I can make it.    I am also very concerned that permanent damage is being done, or if these symptoms will go away once the medicine is stopped.    I am attempting to manage this pain with walking everyday and taking pain meds, but so far I am unsuccessful even with prescription strength pain pills.   This has been incredibly disappointing experience, all this pain with no improvement.   ",1
I took arimedex for 1 year and due to side effects was switched to aromasin which I took for 4 years.  My 5 years ended in March 2012. Never had trouble with my feet until I took this medication.  My knees hurt and my wrists are painful and fingers go numb and tingle.  Thought these symptoms would get better when I stopped the medications but it seems they are getting worse.  Are side effects from hormone blockers permanent?  I know I have a bit of arthritis but not to this extent.,4
"I have been taking this drug since July of 13.  Started out with Arimidex--felt like legs breaking while walking.  Tamoxafin made sugar levels spike to 400's.  After starting this drug, have had vaginal bleeding which is rare side effect but referred to gyn oncologist to have dnc and biopsies of cervix and uterus with nothing going on.  bleeding caused by drug.  Also, lost vision for over a week and this was also rare side effect of Aromasin.  Now I have been waking up 2 or 3 times each night not being able to get my breath and chest, arm and neck pain.  Had to have cardiac cath to rule out heart issues.  This is also another rare side effect.  Afraid to tell breast oncologist because they are all gung-ho about taking the drugs.  I had left mastectomy and total flap reconstruction.  no cancer in lymph nodes.  Am 59 yo and feel 100.  Tired all the time and feel I have lost quality of life.  Hate this drug.  Percentage of cancer returning is 12% but doc says I have to take.  What do you do?",1
"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2013, node neg, and clear margins...Had 37 radiation treatments and started Aromasin 10/13.  so far I have had no side effects.  I already take Lexapro for Depresion, drink joint juice for joint health and caltrate d for bone health.  I have had 1 Prolia injection.  I also take Vit. b-12 injections once a month.  Maybe it is too soon to really make a statement as to side effects, but if the rest of the ime is like this...I can stand it.  I have to take this for 10 years. I have not noticed any hair loss,  but if I do I will take Biotin...Ladies it works.   I will post later on as to any changes.  God Bless and keep up the hard, good work. One day there will be a cure!",4
"I have HER2++ lobular breast cancer.  Had chemo, radical MX and 26 days rads.  Am now on Aromasin and have had no side effects",5
"I take Aromasin daily and have Faslodex and Xgeva injections every four weeks. For the first few months of treatment for Metastatic Breast Cancer, I was only doing the Faslodex and Xgeva. After seeing a new study, my Oncologist suggested adding Aromasin to my treatment. Since then, my tumors have really responded well. In the past two years, they have all shrunk and have not spread to any new sites. All three of my medications cause bone and joint pain so I can't blame it all on the Aromasin. The pain is certainly there but it is tolerable and I am still alive with very good quality of life. I do use opioid painkillers to help with pain control. I believe Aromasin is saving my life and it is a life worth saving.",5
"I have the usual reported side effects, such as bone & muscle pain, hot flashes, etc.  But, for the past year, I've had some gum inflammation & some gum lesions.  Has anyone had these symptoms from Aromasin?  ",4
"I am a stage 4 breast cancer survivor..I can't remember everything but had messtectomy of left breast had 7 positive lymph nodes and then advanced to my bones. I had radiation (no chemo) was put on femara but side affects to painful. Then put on Aromasin. The confusion gets to me, get  depressed and have what I call gotcha pains...try to stay positive and happy but some days so much harder then others...think its been about or going on 6 years though. Was diagnosed Dec 29th 2007 I think. Its just so hard sometimes to stay positive with all the drama and things around you. I can bare the night sweats. Sometimes the pain is rougher then usual but its the meanness around me that makes it worse <3 I think between the aromasin and the Zometa I have showed signs of shrinking in my back bones. (cancer that is) Dr. said they can't cure me but can help or try and keep cancer at bay. To all my Pink Warriors God Bless you and keep on trucking. Have Faith in God and pay it forward. Getting up to go to Church has done me the most good I think. and the kindness of others a big part also the love and friendship of the ones around me. I think all that helps more then the actual medicine. God Bless you all <3",5
only one week for me ok so far,1
"I started medication right after surgery and had a HORRIBLE time with joint pain so the Dr. and I agreed to stop the medication, felt much better then after a year we tried it again and I take it at dinner in the evening Ive had slight joint pain and tiredness but otherwise doing much better and I feel and hope it is helping time will tell",3
"I have been taking Aromasin for 8 months.  I haven't had as severe side effects as some of the people have shared.  My memory is showing signs of deterioration which is bad because Alzheimer's disease is in my immediate family.  I also have aching joints.  I am not depressed, but I think I have had sometimes when I don't care as much about my job, my house, etc.  I still enjoy my family, friends, and church.  ",3
"I find it odd that we are asked to rate the effectiveness of this drug, since we really have no way of knowing that yet. It's been 2 and a half years, and my cancer has not returned, so I guess it's effective so far. At first, my Doc put me on Arimidex, then Femara, and now Exemestane (Aromasin).  The hot flashes were terrible with the first two, and I still have them on the Exemestane, but they are fewer and less intense.  However, the joint pain is terrible.  My left wrist, arm and shoulder all give me problems. My shoulder and upper arm sometimes ache to the point of making me cry out.  My wrist is so painful that I can't pick up a glass. My cancer was on the left side, and I wonder if that has any bearing on the fact that the worst pain is in my left arm. (Only had one lymph node removed.)  I have a trigger finger on each hand (ring finger on one hand and middle finger on the other). Both hands and fingers are stiff and sore when I first wake up. My hair is rapidly thinning, and I sometimes suddenly start itching, and it could be anywhere on my body. I am also experiencing numbness in my toes and feet. My sleeping patterns are erratic at best, but I'm not depressed. I am glad to still be alive, and hopefully, will make it through another 2 and a half years, cancer-free! I wish for all my sister survivors that you find some peace, and that you can stand the side effects of these drugs 'til you reach your 5-yr goal. Finding something to laugh about each day and having someone to share that laughter with has helped me get through this.  I wish for each of you love, laughter, and many more birthdays.",4
"I have been on this drug for 1 year now. I have some aches in my shoulders but that is it. I realize that this drug causes some major side effects in some people but I feel fortunate that it has not been bad. I do take calcium and glucosamine and chondroitin and that made a big difference. I do not take anything for pain as it is not that bad. I am thankful for this drug, will be glad to stop taking it in 4 years but I just wanted to see something positive on here about this drug. When I first read all the reviews it scared me a lot. Nothing positive at all so I just want to say I am sorry for those of you having such a terrible time with this, but for those who are reading these reviews because you are just starting to take this drug, the side effects are not always as bad for some of us. I am grateful I am one of those who is not suffering with this drug.",5
THIS MEDICATION HAS WORKED FOR ME I HAVE BEEN FREE FOR 18 MONTHS SINCE STARTING THE TREATMENT ,5
"i switched off the Tamoxifen about 45 days ago .... all the bad side effects. I feel the same as on Tamoxifen with the Exemestane, but I am getting a reoccurrence of a bad, painful rash around my face ? Anyone else experience this? I don't know if i should just switch back to the Tamoxifen.",3
I have taken this drug for the past 5 years and now I am off.  I am going thru extreme mood changes coming off the drug,5
"Started with Arimedex and quit taking it after 7 weeks. Could  not tolerate the side effects..joint pain especially in knees and hips my shoulders and back were so painful I could hardly walk, the bottoms of my feet felt like they were on fire..I felt exhausted, with extreme fatigue from the moment I got up in the morning..I had terrible insomnia and was very depressed.  My dr. told me I could not and should not go without any treatment so he put me on aromasin(exemestane)..This drug took about 13 weeks to really kick in as far as the side effects.  At one point I thought I was not going to have any but then they started.. Almost all of the same side effects are there except for the burning on the bottoms of my feet (instead I have a spot on my thigh that feels like someone is holding a hot iron on my leg). The depression comes and goes and I never know when it is going to hit. My memory is very bad..I read and work at brain puzzles hoping to help my memory. Recently my left wrist started hurting and the pain has escalated to the point where I feel like it is broken..but i know it is not it just feels like it.  With all that said I have been on it 9 months and wonder if I any of this damage is reversible.   My heart goes out to all of you ladies who are suffering so much with this drug..and we don't even know if it is going to keep the cancer from coming back. I have in all of this experience started to eat a plant based diet, lots of raw organic fruits and vegetables and started juicing hoping to help my body naturally heal itself to eventually get off of this drug. It is risky but so is taking the drug especially when we have no guarantees it is going to work. Praying for you all, I don't know who you are but God does. God bless",2
"Been taking Aromasin for 2 1/2 years. I have weakness in my legs, muscle pain and I am tired and dragging several days a week. My oncologist advised that I must take it for 5 yrs. Also, have night sweats which disturbs my normal sleeping pattern. Lately I noticed a racing heart rate of 105 beats. Disgusted with taking it!!!",3
"I too was diagnosed with early breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy and lymphnodectomy, along with radiation 5xweek for 8 weeks.  Been on aromasin for a year and the side effects are driving me crazy.  Weight gain, hair thinning and insomnia among other aches..I want to stop taking this drug so much but have no choice since the other cancer drugs have bad side effects as well.  I too find it strange that after a year, the side effects seem to get worse or grow....",3
"Like many of you who have written a review of this medication, I too have experienced the unbearable, dibilitating painful joints and body when taking this medicine, along with depression that felt like doom came over me.  It made me feel worse.  I have tried this medicine twice now, once after 1 1/2 years after my double mastectomy after having been on tamoxifin.  Not having been able to tolerate the Famara either with the same experience of body pain and depression.   Tamoxifin causes some side effects but are more manageable, especially working 40 hours or more a week.  Fatigue is the major effect for me on all of these drugs.  For a while I was allowed to start my work day at 10:00 AM and work until 6:00 PM, but that isn't the case anymore.  I try and fight my fatigue with a nap in my car at lunch which has made a difference for me.  It is all a struggle however.  And now, the research shows that 10 years of after treatment is better than 5.  So it looks like this is my life for much longer than anticipated in the beginning of finding out I had breast cancer.  It's good to know that I am not the only one having trouble like this - validation is a great thing.",2
"I had early onset breast cancer.  Had mamosite radition for 5 days and no chemo.  Started out on arimidex for 3 monhs and felt totally out of it.  Switched to aromasin 17 moths ago.  Have severe joint pain, insomnia, some depression, numbing and tingling in my fingers.  Had carpal tunnel surgey on the right hand. Know the med is causing symptoms in the left hand, so no surgery.  Very hard to function a times.  Not sure what to do.  Afraid to stop taking it, but feel so much better off of it.  Would love to know why side effects show up a year after starting the med.  ",3
I find Aromasin to have the least amount of side effects but one of the worse side effects.  Joint and muscle pain with artist and painful trigger thumb and finger.  I feel like my hands won't hold a pen and I drop things constantly.  Please know this is direct side effect to the aromasin.  I'm 55 yrs young and feel 100 inside.  I can handle a lot but this is very painful and I hope there is no permanent damage. ,3
"Miserable with all over body aches. Knees, hands, feet. Can't find the energy to exercise and barely get out of bed in the a.m.  I am weighing the possibility of ending treatment. Was on Tamoxifen for 3 years - switched to Aromasin 6 months ago. I am not sure that another two years (now reports are saying take the meds for 10 years vs 5!) is worth the recurrence risk. I don't feel I have much of a lifestyle at all this way. What are others doing????",2
"Hi all been reading your feedback. I am in same boat as those who are wondering what would happen, would it be detrimental to stop taking these drugs. I was prescribed tamaxifen then told not to take it. I was then given Arimedex and suffered severe fatigue breathlessness, felt like 100 couldnt make it up the stairs, it was very distressing.Got worse quickly, couldnt wash hair,lift anything, drive the ripple affect -you can imagine. Stopped taking them and breathing improved dramatically. Was given Femera, this was just as bad, sweats and lack of sleep equally bad, but seemed better at first two weeks but third week the scary breathlessnes returned and I stopped taking them. suffered for three weeks AFTER stopping this drug.  Now Dr wants me to take aromasin, and like other ladies, I just starting to feel a little normal for first time in 9 months, and am afraid to take them. Quality oflife is important to and when you read that it does not prevent return if your susceptable but only slows it down it does make you wonder. I too felt guilty about not taking them- so what are we to do  one dr thinks quality life equally important -another says vital to take the drugs. I had early estrogen fed breast cancer very small lobular infiltrating. nothing in nodes. lumptecomy and radiation -similar to other ladies so is the risk worth the damage these drugs appear to cause?? I too would have liked a space to enable us to respond to blogs and feedback. thanks for listening to my rant , warm wishes I have to take these drugs for seven weeks and report back to onocologist- and I am afraid to take them!!!feel guilty if I dont.",2
"Developed Carpel Tunnel Symdrome and trigger finger.  Fatty liver and high blood pressure since taking Aromasin generic for ER PR positive breast cancer.  Abdominal bloating, and just diagnosed with kidney cancer. Arimidex was even worse, I'm running out of options.",2
so far so good,5
"After almost 5 years on Aromasin (after mascetomy, 6 chemos and 30 radiations) and many side effects that have left me with permanent foot pain, a knee blowout, significant hair loss, weight gain, joint pain,bone loss, skin problems etc. I am sorry to report I have a reocurrence in my other breast.  No sense in preserving the breast tissue on this side since I am afraid of another issue down the line so I will be having another mascetomy. I am very disppointed but resigned to the surgery.  I am 72 years old now and got through the worst of the temporary side effects and thought it was worth dealing with the rest in lieu of cancer.  So the damage to my body has been done and I don't think stopping the drug will result in any significant ""bouncing back"" but I'm hoping to feel a little better.  I stopped taking it today!!  I do believe that it is probably a worthwhile treatment and I wish it had worked for me.",1
"sweats that last 30 to 45 minutes, weight gain, pain in joints and burning sensation  when you urinate",4
I was diagnosed with Stage IIa breast cancer 3 years ago. No lymph node affected. Had mastectomy of left breast. I was originally on Arimidex for 12 months and felt absolutely horrible. Switched to Armosasin and am able to tolerate it better but still have soreness in my knees. It's better than Arimidex but I'd rather not have to take anything.,4
"I was given Aromasin appx 1 month ago. I had been on Arimidex and could not tolerate it. I am having trouble with the Aromasin also. Cannot think, depressed, extreme hot flashes. I am 61 and had stage 1 breast cancer, not in my lympnoids, I am wondering if I should even take this medication.  I feel so much better without it. Just not sure!",1
"fatigue,bone and joint pain in hands and feet sometimes pretty severe.",4
"I am so glad I found all these postings.  I am on Aromacin for 2 yrs now and I have so many ""power surges"" during the night I can't sleep.  I have so much pain in my joints and my bones.  I had arthritis before I started this med, but now it is alot worse.  I am afraid of not taking the medication because I don't want the Cancer to come back.  I want to thank all the women who have written about their experience with this drug...I thought I was going nuts.  I walk and try to do the same things all my friends do even if I am in pain.  I refuse to let this bring me down.",3
"I am 45 years old and have been on this drug for two years. My oncologist switched me from Tamoxifin because I could hardly walk after being stationary for 30 minutes or longer. Aromisin side effects aren't as severe. I work out three days a week and walk 30 -60 minutes per day. It seems to help the joint pain, sleeplessness and weight gain, but the stiffness remains.  Recently I developed a burning in one knee and a sharp pain in the other foot. It feels as if my achilles tendon could snap if pulled in the wrong direction! My knee feels as if something has torn and has begun unravelling? Has anyone experienced damaged tendons or ligaments? My Dr. thinks this is unrelated, but my trainer is a BC survivor and she has had major issues with her knee and achilles tendon (surgery) after being on these drugs. I'm not a die-hard bodybuilder, just a mom wanting to feel well enough to keep up with my kids!",5
"Originally, six years ago I had Stage 2b BC & was on Tamoxifen.  It came back Stage 4 approximately 6 months out of treatment.  I have been on every bc drug for ER+ cancer.  Now, I am on Aromasin.  I've been on it for almost 2 years now & have terrible side effects.  I'm 37 & walk like a 70 year old due to severe foot & leg pain (in addition to neuropathy from chemo & arthritis that has gotten worse with chemo & Aromasin).  I have a foggy brain -- memory is cloudy & concentration is difficult.  Hot flashes are always happening, however, this is a good thing because the drug is doing it's job.  Insomnia from time to time, I use Melatonin for it.  Nausea from the drug makes eating difficult, however, I've put on 80 pounds in 2 years from this drug.  I'm mentally sound & overall happy, physically miserable, but I'm alive & blessed!  ",3
"Joint aches seem to be getting worse, been on drug for about 6 weeks. I thought the effects were from every 3 week infusion of Herceptin but Dr office thinks is from Aromasin. Have been advised to take ibuprofen and Osteo Biflex. Hope it helps. I am supposed to go back to work soon when short term disability ends. May not be possible but I hate all the paperwork for disability. Yes depression lurks in the dark of night and sometimes in the light of day. First hormone drug tried gave headaches, chemo brain does not let me remember what I was on. Will keep fighting and will WIN! Never give up, no matter what!",3
"Bone pain, especially at night. Dizziness, wakefulness through the night. ",4
"I have been on this medicine for 4 1/2 years. The past few months have been the worst. Every joint in my body hurts, night sweats and sleepless nights. It takes all I have to get out of bed in the morning. I have 6 more months.",4
"shortly after starting the drug (04/2010), I developed a cough, which I still have.  Had a dose of sinus infection, sore throat, worse coughing just before Christmas.  Chose to let my immunity fight it off instead of antibiotics.  Took 3-4 weeks to get over it, but I did it on my own.  (would have went to the dr. had I really needed to). Still have the cough.  Tried arimidix first-made my hands, feet and face swell.  Satified with aromasin except for cough.  Really, don't want to switch to something else.  Keep taking your meds!",4
"I had a forced menopause after the 2nd cycle of chemo for my stage 2A BC. Never taking tamoxifen, was prescribed Femara for 2 months and then switched over to Aromasin following the chemo and radiation therapies.It has been 6 months since taking Femara and Aromasin. First experienced severe back and knee pains then had hand surgery for my Carpel Tunnel syndrome and now the pains has extended to all bones and joints, mostly in my hands and wrists. Memory loss and attention deficit is getting obvious. Hot flashes and insomnia is concerned. Without having daily walk and exercise and Melatonin Plus for sleep support, I would be miserable with all the side effects from the drugs. I have been on Alendronate sodium (Fosamax)for 4 months used to prevent from Osteoporosis, was wondering it has made it worse. ",3
"After 20 days on armidex I was suicidal, had severe bone pain, severe insomnia.  I switched to aromasin and have found it easier to tolerate if I take meds for the side effects. I take ambien to sleep, percocet for pain, wellbutrin for depression.  It's either treat the side effects or i have a 70% chance of cancer recourrence.  I will give it six months because sometimes the side effects do get better and I don't want to die at age 63. But there does come a point when quality of life wins out==however short it may be.",4
I was prescribed aromasin by my doctor after the other 2 AIs had adverse side effects. I took it for 3 yrs and 3 months. I could not tolerate the lack of quality of life.,1
"I have developed severe muscle pain, especially in my thighs and the muscles around my knees, to the point of extreme pain when walking.  I have also had pain in my neck, biceps and lower legs.",5
I had tried femara and arimidex and do like this medication above the others.  Still have joint aches and hot flashes on this med.  Most of I dislike the fogginess of the brain.  ,3
"Have had major side affects with it.  Tried Arimadex first, then was prescribed this one; a little more manageable, but still have trouble.  Joint pain, sweats, muscle cramps and renaud's syndrome.",2
"Has anyone have any trouble with fatty liver I'm on aromasin and have been for 4 mos. cry alot and have a little bit of foggy days, but still think that Ihave to do what I need to do, this is my third med. can't wait for the five years to be up.",3
"I had a single breast (left) mastectomy in 04/13/2010 and completed my six months chemo on 11/19/2010. I was 61 yrs old when I had my mastectomy.    My oncologist placed me on Femara in 01/07/2011.  I suffered so much side affects (as he warned me abt) such as joint/muscle aches and pain, poor memory, severe hot flashes, depression/anxiety, cried frequently,  walked and moved around like an feebled 80 yrs old.  No weight gain but lowers my HBP from previous 130-140 down to 90's-101.   I can only functon in the morning hours by mid-afternoon I have to reclined for the rest of the day/night til next morning again.  I complained and my oncologist removed me from Femara 04/1/1011 thru 04/30/2011.  My dr. prescribed Aromasin beginning 05/01/2011 and I am still on it.  All the above side affects disappeared  2 weeks after I got off Femara. I started my walking regime of 45 minutes 4-5 days/wk and felt much better with much energy 60 days after taking it.  However, after 60 days (7/5/11-present), I am experiencing now severe cramps (charlie horse) from my upper thighs down to my toes that paralyzed me for a minute (or it appears that long).  This is occuring sometimes 3 times at night.  During its legs down to my toes.  I noticed though that this occurs whenever I am on my feet for more than 1 hr and sometimes I am on feet from 3-8 hrs daily.  I live in Hawaii (Big Island) and my husb and I own a coffee farm/landscaping nursery that since I am feeling much energy tried doing physical activities.  Now as of today (08/10/11), I will no longer spend more than 1 hr on my feet to see if this severe cramps will stop.  Is anyone out there experiencing leg/body cramps?  Your response will be greatly appreciated.  Aloha! ",3
"I have been on this drug for five years.  I don't plan on going off it, unless my onocologist says I have to.  I do not want to get cancer again.  I have had no problems, except lately I do have some knee and hip pain.  But I am going to be sixty, and I know lots of 60+ plus women who have aches and pains and are not on aromasin.  We all have to do weight bearing exercises.  I have not done them for about two months.  I realize I have to get on track and start doing these exercises again.  I golf twice - three times a week and I walk.  I am a twice breast cancer survivor and a few aches and pains is far worth not getting cancer again, as I am going to be a grandma.  I did not gain weight but my memory is not the greatest.  Once again is that the drug or my age???  Hang in there everyone, as the drug is keeping us alive.  Get out and exercise, eat properly and get the sleep you require.  I do take melatolin at night.  It is not a drug.  ",5
I was 40 when I was diagnosed BC stage 1. Right breast  mastectomy. No Chemo. My oncologist started me on Femara 2.5. I took it for one month when my thoughts became very foggy. I was depressed & had a lot of foot pain & HOT FLASHES! Now I'm on Aromasin for 5 1/2 months. I'm meds for my depression & I'm having new health issues with my thyroid. The hot flashes are worst now. Blood pressure is low @ times. I've lost 20 pounds.  These medications don't for me. It's getting even more sick.,2
"Stage 111 BC, double mastectomy/lymph nodes removed. Chemo for 6 monthe before surgery and for another 5 months after surgery. After the chemo started on the aromatase inhibitors.  Was told it would be for 5 years minimum.  Femara caused joint pain, nausea staph infections and suicidal thoughts. Stopped for 2 weeks and restarted. The side effects were worse.  Quit.  Switched to Aromasin and struggled for 11 months. My life was hell: hot flushes that were causing me to black out, insomnia, brain fog, nausea, joint pain and muscle stiffness, blood pressure issues and severe eye issues. Quit for 1 month.  By week 3 off of the drug the difference in how I felt was astonishing.  I have restarted Aromasin but take it every 2 days.  Better than not takeing it at all.  My Oncologist is horrified.   Now I can get out of a chair, work full time, walk the dog and clean my house. I will take my chances of a reoccourance in order to have a higher quality of life! ",3
"I have been on exemestane for a month now.  I have had a bi-lateral mastectomy, chemo and will start radiation this week.  I hate this drug.  I have constant headaches, ringing ears, diahrea, blurred vision, anxiety, slight swelling in my throat, clogged sinuses, swelling ankles, joint pain, you name it I've got it.  I'm 61 and don't want to spend the rest of my life like this.  My husband is 15 yrs younger than me and doesn't understand why I don't want to continue the med.  My memory is gone too.  I think quality is better than quantity.",1
My only issue with this drug is the side effect of hot flashes and trouble sleeping. I suffered with hot flashes before taking it and that seems to have only increased.,4
"I chose to have mastectomy of my right breast (Dec. 08)rather than lumpectomy early stage estrogen receptor breast cancer (1.5) with sentinal node removed but all OK & clear and not in lymph glands  I didn't have to have radiation but oncologist insisted that I had to go on the medication treatment for at least 5 years.  Was on Femara first (Jan to April 2009) and did terribly.  I was already taking Prozac antidepressant /anxiety to help cope.  Then Oncologist had me go off Femara to clear out my system and I felt so so much better during that off 5-6 week period that I didn't want to go back on anything.  But oncologist insisted I try the Aromasin.  Basically all the same problem/side effects came back, (except for the heel pain) the fatigue, aching, (particularly arms), back and shoulder pain, headaches, practically daily when waking up a.m., along with that brain fatigue /fog. and extreme effort just to concentrate on any tasks, also waking up all during night.   I will be on the Aromasin 2 years this June 2011 when I see oncologist and I don't know if I can put up with taking Aromasin for another 3 years plus.  I'm torn between taking it to keep the cancer from coming back or taking my chances and stop Aromasin and just continue taking my vitamins supplements (Centrum Silver Multi, Caltate Calcium plus D formula with minerals, Omega Fish oil capsule, Glucosamine Condroitin Complex (seems to help knees, feet). As information the patents just expired in 4/2011 for Aromasin brand also Femara with generic versions now being dispensed unless your doctor fights for you inforcing do not substitute.  Who knows what additional side effects problems generics might give despite that we are told they are the same.  Also copay for the brand went up from $90 to $200 for same quantity.",3
After 1-1/2yr on tamoxifen I tolerated side affects well. Taking aromasin since April 2011 After one month on aromasin my blood pressure is out of control and the headaches feel like chemo headaches mind is still foggy but i manage body aches by jumping on my mini trampoline it helps bring down my bp instantly never surrender never give up,4
"First batch of side effects have passed but were severe.  Left with very bad foot pain, knees are shot, stiffness, weight gain, hair loss, and add stomach pain from calc. supplments.  3 years into it and I can't walk down steps normally (I have to sidestep one foot at a time).  Age now 70 (cancer age 67).  Dr. says I should stay on about 7 years due to tumor size but each   patient will be evaluated individually.  He  says it is very effective and while he does not want me to be a balding, fat, cancer-free cripple, he does encourage me to stay with it.  I'm trying!  Now diagnosed with pre-diabetes.  Anybody else finding this to be so?",5
"Before this treatment, I was very active and could move with ease.  I now have severe joint aches.(knees,elbows, wrists, shoulders)  If I sit for any length of time my ankles and feet ache so much it is hard to get moving.  I hate this drug.  My Oncologist will not let me change. I also have monthly bladder infections due to the pooling of the drug in my urinary tract.  My MD has now placed me on a small dose antibiotic to assist with that issue.  I hate taking drugs to begin with.  Is this really a necessary deterrant?",4
I have very little side effects. sometimes I have stomach problems.,5
"I'm 59, BC, stage 1, operated in Aug 2011, took Arimidex for a week, it caused me terrible stomach cramps because I am intolerated to lactose; so my Dr switched me to Aromasin for 3.5 months now. I now experience stiff and some pain in hands joints, night and day. I do exercice, practice and teach Tai Chi & Qigong everyday, the hand joints problem persist. I don't want to live with this problem for 5 years more. I'll see the Dr in 3 mths, consider the possibility of stop taking theses pills.  Is there any of you who stops the med and OK afterward? i.e no cancer recurrence.",2
"I think I may have IBS, because when I took formerally the Arimidex and then the Aromasin I took it for about 3 weeks then I started getting all these hot flashes,diarrea,(bloody the last time), and bad sinus congestions, and since being off the pill for just one week I am feeling very much better. I just don`t want to feel like that, because it is really hard for me.  I am due back at my oncologist dr. in early Feb. for more blood work so I will see what he says for me then.  I am staying off till I see him. I did have to have Chemo, just 6 weeks of radiation, alongwith the breast surgery, there wasnt any cancer in the lymps, or tumors anywhere. But I just cant take these anticancer pills, the side affects are dreadfull for me. Thanks for listening. Bonnie",1
"Early stage breast ca,age 69,2.5 yrs on tamoxifen,(have uterus and osteopenia),8 mo on aromasin. Declined herceptin,with no objection from oncologist. Fleeting muscle aches gone, now tiredness and joint pain makes me feel terrible. I had lumpectomy or radiation option,but had bilateral mastectomies (negative nodes)at my request,instead. I guess if I don't feel any worse, which is bad enough, I'll try to ride out the aromasin. ",5
"Diagnosed with stage 1 bilateral BC (estrogen receptor positive), April 2010 (Lobular AND ductal carcinoma.) Double Mastectomy, reconstruction, hysterectomy ... all last year. Onc. put me on Tamoxifen in June ... TERRIBLE side-effects including severe depression. Tried Femara in the fall, but same side-effects. Switched to Aromasin in Dec., so am going on my 3rd month now. Side effects have been milder until now, but I am starting to have terrible problems with hand/finger numbness. Joint pain isn't as severe as with other drugs, but is still bad enough, so I wonder if I can take this for 5 years. Weight-gain and hot-flashes are terrible too, and I suddenly developed heel-bone-spurs shortly after starting all this medication ... my feet still hurt so badly, I can't walk without pain, so naturally, I have gained a lot of weight. But my biggest question is:  Will the damage done to my joints due to this medication be permanent, even after the 5 years are over with? If so, I can't afford that risk. I'm a fine artist, and fear the total loss of feeling in my hands someday, as well as finger joints that no longer function! There was NO CANCER in my lymph-nodes and my tumors were small ... so why do I even need this? My Mom is a 19-yr. BC survivor now (stage 1, single mastectomy), and never had ANY of this medication! (Also ... how do you respond to others' comments on here, and can other people respond to my comment?? I can't figure out how to do that ... so I question whether or not there is even a way to get answers from others.) I really am trying to hang in there ... but I'm only 50, and feel 90. My frequent comment to others is ""they take the cancer out of you ... and remove body parts ... and then they try to KILL you with the medication!"" I'm usually a very positive, happy person ... but this is ruining my life, and my outlook.",3
I was taking Aromidex for one year. Pain in joints became extreme. My onc. gave me a month off and I felt wonderful. We switched to aromasin.  I have been on this a month and a half.  For the last three weeks I have had diarrhea. He assured me this was not a symptom of this drug.  I finally went to my G.P. He found that it is a symptom!  Is there anyone that has had this problem???????,4
"I had breast cancer in January 2009 and had a lumpectomy in June 2009. I have been on Aromasin for14 months and have been told i have to take it for 5 years in total,I have constant pain in my joints and the thought of taking it for the required time horrifies me. Hoping that when i see the Doctor she will change the medication. My resricted movement is spoiling my life.",3
"Have experienced many of the side effects, that others have reported here in these posts.  Did not associate these side effects with the Aromasin, but now I will talk to my oncologist about them.  But I only have another few months to go, have been on tamoxifen, arimidex and couldn't tolerate any of them as well as I did the aromasin. My 5 yrs. will be up in Feb. 2011. I do hope all the side effects will become less severe than they have been.  But I am just thankful to be here today.  The Lord has helped me to overcome.",3
"First diagnosed w/breast cancer in 1997. Lumpectomies, chemo and radiation. Twelve years later...it's back. In 2009 double mastectomy w/tram flap reconstruction. On Femara for one year, terrible muscle and joint pain. Switched to Aromasin and after 6 months have severe knee pain, at times I can't walk. Terrible hot flashes and sweating also a problem, now I realize the ""brain fog"" is a possible side effect! I stopped taking it yesterday and the knee pain is already better. I will see my oncologist in a month, I truly think I want to go the all natural way. No more drugs....I want to feel good and enjoy life at 55.",3
"I was taking tamoxifin for abt a yr and that  seemed to drain all of my strength NO energy my oncologisy switched me to aromasin yes there is joint pain in my legs everyday yes it was unbearable but then my dr give me a high dose of vitamin D i must say i havent had the leg pain at all since talk to your dr see if your vitamin D levels are low we have been thru a lot with our body im fortunate i havent had any depression my spirits are really high ,we have to think like this  never happened and move on with life live life like its your last... smile survivors we are still here ",5
"memory loss, aching joints, stomach pain",4
"There is some joint and muscle pain as well as difficulty sleeping.  However, aromasin has worked better for me than the other two aromatase inhibitors I previously tried.",4
Stage 1 breast cancer neg lyph lumpectomy and radiation. Took Tamoxafin for 1 year then switched to Aromocin after moving and new Drs. 1 year later developed Dequervanes Tenocinitis in both wrists after struggling to figure out what it was. Had successful surgery for both wrists. Some trouble sleeping but no other major complaints.I have some concerns about taking with osteopenia but my Oncol wants me to stay on for 5 years minimum. I have just a few more months to go! One strange symtom I don't believe is related but wanted to ask - I have lost my sense of smell. Has that happened to anyone else? ,5
"After 18 months on Aromasin. I have suffered  memory loss, brain fog, painful joints  knees. It is intolerable . I'd rather take my ""chances"" drug free than go on like this. I have quit for 2 weeks now feel 1000% better. These comments are very helpful. ",3
"Dx- Stage 1, DCIS, ER/PR+, premenopausal Tx- Mastectomy, Sentinal node biopsy, TRAM Flap reconstruction in Feb, 2006. Started on Tamoxifin with hellish hot flashes/night sweats, took for one year with drug holidays. Had ovaries removed Jan,2007 started Aromasin in the fall. Oncologist prescribed Aromasin first because I have pre-existing chronic pain condition and Aromasin has lower pain profile.  Hot flashes not as bad as when on Tamoxifen and are controlled with Gabepentin and diet- very little refined sugars, no alcohol.  I can tell when I drink a sugared soft drink, especially soda, have hot flashes within less than an hour. Increase in pain is troublesome and interferes greatly with quality of life.  But my oncologist, physiatrist and primary care provider are working together to help control the pain with medication. I do my part by pushing myself to stay active - walking, water aerobics, Wii Sports, or any non-weightbearing exercise as well as mind-body work. The exercise is so, so important.  Helps me feel like I have at least some control over my condition and side effects of treatment. It is giving me the chance to try to stick out the entire 5 years on the Aromasin.",4
"I was 61 y.o. when diagnosed 8/18/09 with breast cancer. Had lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy (nodes neg. for cancer)followed by 31 rx's w/radiation. Took Femara for 6 hellish months, told my Oncologist that it was sucking out the quality of my life; and she had me come off it for about 5 wks to clear it out of my system. I was given the choice of not taking anything (which I thought was a huge risk) or filling the prescription she gave me for Aromasin, which I eventually did. During the time i took no drugs, I did feel much improved; but it may have been more psychological, rather than physical. Now after being on Aromasin for 2 months, all the familiar symptoms have returned, including swollen joint in my R.big toe which my GP diagnosed as Gout...NOT! When the bloodwork results came in my uric acid level was well w/in normal range. After 2 1/2 wks. all the imflammation and swelling went away and I can walk normal again. I'm not sure what to do from here, I hate that the drugs seem to hasten the aging process, along with all the other symptoms many of you have already mentioned; but I am not considering going down that surgery/radiation road again and want to do all I can to prevent cancer reoccuring. BTW, I have found 5-HTP helpful in holding off depression. It is a natural mood elevator that boosts seratonin levels and can be found in most healthfood stores. I am also on a good vit/min regimen that does much to strengthen my immune system. There really is much one can do beside relying heavily on just the prescribed drugs.",5
"Taking aromasin for 1 wk.  Feel beginnings of sweat,itching, swelling,depression,joint stiffness: all of which had gotten much better after cpl. months since chemo, radiation, and shingles. If I can't sleep without pills....I'm going to stick with this for 1 month and then WHAT? ",3
"on Arimdex and Aromasin had joint pain,fatigue,weight gain, hair loss plus more. talked to my Dr not the oncologist. told him if felt the quality of life was more important to me than quantity.  He said the meds do not cure or keep the cancer from returning if you are going to get a re-occurance it only slows the progress of it. I have quit taking the meds and I feel so much better and decided if the cancer returns I will deal with it then but for now I am feeling great, the pain and fatigue, etc has gone away so am very pleased.  I decided feeling good and enjoying my family now is worth the chance. The Dr agreed with me. ",4
my experience have been joins inflammation and increase on cholesterol level.  would these symptoms disappeared after i stop taking the medication?,5
"I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 2000 - had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.  Because I had 1 positive lymphnode my oncologist put me on tamoxofen for 5 yrs, then aromasin.  It has been 10 yrs & they still have me on the aromasin.  One the one hand, I'm afraid to stop for fear I will have a recurrence, but on the other hand, I have all the symptoms I am reading about from others on the drug: terrible trouble sleeping, extreme lethargy, such pain in my shoulders it wakes me when I turn over in the night, swollen joints in some of my toes so that I can't wear a lot of my shoes, brain in a fog and depression.  I was beating myself up and thinking I must be crazy before I read these posts!  Is the joint pain due to cartilege being destroyed by the drug? Why don't they tell you any of this when they prescribe the drug?!  The last thing any bc survivor needs is to feel like she is imagining all these problems!!!   ",5
"Overall, I've had side effects that are very uncomfortable. Joint pain, fatigue,flu like symptoms, bone pain.  Doc. allowed me to stop taking the drug, as he wanted to see if it was the aromasin, or just my own body.  After I stopped taking...Miracle!  Two months now and no pain.  However, I don't think he'll (doc) will set me free from these estroblock drugs.  At least now I know it's the drug and not my own body failing me.",5
"have been on Aromasin for 41/2 years and just realized with your great comments why I have such joint pains especially in my hands, hot flashes even with Effexor, sleepness nights, depression etc.I hope the symptoms arei not irreversible and that it was worth taking but can't wait to stop and resume my normal life.",3
"Horrible joint pain, body aches,enlarged joints, hair loss in early months of taking this medication; vaginal dryness,blah, blah, however everytime I think about NOT taking thismed I think about the alternative & become thankful I'm alive to have these symptoms! It's not pleasant but the medication DOES work.I want to grow old with my hubby of 30yrs & spoil grandkids! Just another ""have to do"" thing in life!",5
"Breast cancer with one lymph node positive.  I was on Femara for 3 mos. and had terrible muscle/joint pain, especially feet, legs, and back.  Then I took Aromasin for 3 mos. having all the same symptoms, plus more hair loss.  Now I'm on Tamoxifen, aching isn't as bad, but still no more hair and you can see my scalp.  I've been on it 2 mos.  So far, Tamoxifen is the better choice for me.  I wouldn't want to go back on Femara or Aromasin again!!",1

Now in remission and on aromasin. Still in pain. Taking viccodin during the day and duladid at night. Mega doses of B-6 worked first time around, but not this time. Can only imagine what all the pain killers are doing to my liver and kidneys. Constant joint pain, numb hands and toes, sometimes it feels like I have a broken bone on the top of my foot and can hardly walk, on and on and tired. Headaches! What can I take to feel like me again? ",1
"I was on Tamoxifen for 1 1/2 years, on Femara for 1 year and had horrible joint pain and vaginal dryness,  my doctor switched to Aromasin 14 months ago,  it is easier on the joints but still the joint pain persist, biggest issue is fatigue inability to sleep, joint pain, numbness in fingers, and difficult concentrating on and off I miss sex with my husband due to dryness and vaginal pain,  think I am getting close to calling it quits with the meds",5
"I was on Femara first for 6 months.  I had so much joint pain, I thought I was 90 years old.  Oncologist put me on Aromasin.  Within 3 months I had the same joint pain.  I started experimenting taking the drug every other day.  Taking it this way allowed me to function with little to no joint pain.  My Oncologist didn't like the idea, but after running some tests to determine that my hormone levels were where he wanted them, I have continued for 5 years taking it every other day.  I have some numbness in my fingers especially on very hot humid days, or very cold days.  I too have experienced the depression, but since taking a Super B-Complex vitamin and 4000 IU's of vitamin D every day, we seem to have gotten that under control.  I've also experienced the hot flashes, but have managed to get them under control by limiting the amount of sugar in my diet.  If I eat a bunch of sugary things like cake and cookies etc. I know to expect the hot flashes.  If I eat healthy foods, I do not experience hot flashes.  My struggle with this drug is a total lack of sexual desire.  This has put a huge strain on my marriage.  ",4
"i am experiencing more depression,crying jags,etc. but have had much less joint pain. I have m.s. so this looks like it for me regardless.",3
I have been on aromasin for almost a year and when I started the hot flashes was a nightmare. They seem to have calm down a little. My feet has been giving me so much trouble I can't even hardly walk at times. And now I am beginning to have really bad knee problems. I hope all this don't last the hole 5 years but I am very thankful for still having life! Surgery and radation was bad and hope I will never have to experience it again. This medicine is rough but with the help of God I will be able to manage the pain and hurt.,4
"I have been on this treament for 6 months now. I was taking Tomoxifen for 2 years prior with hardly any side affects. Since taking Aromasin i now feel like 92 instead of 52. My legs, arms and neck hurt so much now,i'm finding it so difficult with the joint pain even to get out of a chair or the car. My next visit to the breast nurse is in June and i am going to ask to come off these tablets. Good luck to you all.",5
"Was dxd with stage one breast cancer in May of 2007 at the age of 56.  At first I was on Arimidex.  Joint pain, hot flashes, night sweats made my life miserable.  I did not take anything for 3 weeks(life was wonderful) then was put on Aromasin.  I have been on this drug since July of 2008.  At first the joint pain was bad, but has seemed to level off somewhat the last few months.  I try to walk every day or every other day and keep busy.  I would love to be able to wear my rings again and be able to walk normal after sitting for a while.  Also the night sweats are annoying.  All in all not a good experience taking these drugs,  but they do seem to be working so far.  Stick with it if you can!!",4
"I took Tamoxifin for 5 years and switched to Femara.  After a few months, I had no strength in my hands and every joint ached.  Switched to Aromasin and so far so good.  I have developed severe itching on my body and am wondering if anyone else had this issue.  I have allergies, but they have been under control until recently.  ",4
"I hate it....I have been on Aromasin since July 2007 and developed severe deQuervanes tendonitis bilaterally which required surgery....joint pain, swollen knuckles (had to size my rings a full size), depression, insomnia, anxiety to name a few of the side effects...I want to feel good...I keep telling my onc that I want to stop taking AI's and he keeps telling me that it is too important to my survival to stay on it for at least 5 years and probably longer...but what good is longevity if you are miserable....if I could just get a handle on mood....I'm on antidepressants....can't cry and feel flat (with our without antidepressants)....",5
"life on this drug is hell, I have so much back pain I can do very little, a good nights sleep would by great, 2 hours not enough. I have pain in my hands and fingers and an unable to dress myself, do my housework or pick anything up, I drop things, having a ""smashing"" time.  Because life is unfortable my Doctor has taken me off it for the time being to get my life back.",2
"My mother has just finished her 5th year of this drug, is there anyone other there that has?  She has been going through horrible mood swings, crying all the time, not sleeping, and just plain freaking out.  Anyone else see this?",4
"I have joint pain in the hands, knees, and shoulders. At night, I'm often waked by hand pain and numbness. During the day, the hand pain persists, and I also having difficulty standing from a kneeling position.",5
"Diagnosed for the second time with breast cancer after 23 years, started on Femara. After 3 months, became very sick; went on Arimidex for 8 moths until I became nauseated, also gained weight.  Now just starting ( 2 weeks) on Aromasin -- brain fog, dizzness and joint pain, and hair loss already.  There are other drugs I've heard about (Foreston, Zoladex) does anyone have experience with these drugs. Trying to stay positive.  Bless everyone with this disease.",1
"age 52 stage 1 breast cancer post lumpectomy and radiation.was on arimidex for 3 weeks and had fatigue, trouble sleeping, hot flashes and terrible pain in shoulders and neck. at the end of the day it hurt to hold up my head, was using percocet to get to sleep.  dr took me off the arimidex for 2 weeks ( it has been 1 week so far)then i am to start the aromasin, after reading the comments, i don't think i want to take anything.  if i refuse this med will the cancer come back? i need to make a decision within the week and am not sure what to do.  the more i talk with other women the more i think they should have taken the whole damn breast.",1
"I took Arimidex for 26 months and had terrible side effects;joint, muscle pain, fatigue,weight gain.  I switched to Aromasin and have been on it 3 1/2 months.  At first it seemed much better but I have ended up in the ER twice with severe anxiety attacks.  Left arm goes numb or tingly, no strength in legs, loss of memory, thinning hair and weight loss.  I don't know if I will continue or quit - I meet with my oncologist in January for my 3 year review.  I am 69 years old and I think I would rather have my happy, productive life back even if it's shorter.",3
what is the difference between the aromasin and the drug arimidex they are both breast cancer drugs but one is a anastrozole and one is a evemestane I don't know what these are or mean please tell me ? ,5
"I am 57.  Diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at 55. I had mastectomy , reconstruction, chemo and radiation.  Took 2 other drugs but I had serious joint pain.  I still have some joint pain, thinning hair, sweating, sleeplessness, some forgetfulness and I am tired. On the positive side, I am alive, I have strong faith in God,  in relatively good health, go to work daily with a smile on my face.  Simply stated I enjoy my life, my family, my work and friends to the fullest.  I will not allow the bothersome side effects, of a drug that is helping to keep me healthy and cancer free,  rain on my parade! ",4
"Hair loss, joint pain, bone pain, numbness and tingling in my feet, night sweats, insomna.  I have gain weight since I started taking this drug. I was first prescribed Arimdex but couldn't tolerate it.  ",3
"Following a lumpectomy for stage 0 (DCIS) I had radiation and then started tamoxifen.  Unfortunately, my oncologist found that I am one of the 10% of women who do not metabolize tamoxifen, so it is ineffective (this is a relatively new test, but all women taking tamoxifen should ask their doctor about it!!).  I took arrimidex for five months and in addition to hot flashes I experienced severe aching in my joints and limbs.  I switched to aromasin, and after ten months, the stiffness in my joints forced me to stop that, too.  If I sat for 1/2 hour watching TV, my hips got so stiff I would hobble around for 15 minutes afterwards.  I did yoga 2x a week which helped a little, but I was too stiff and tired to do more strenuous exercise.  I also developed 3 trigger fingers which I believe was related to fluid retention caused by the drug, and a marked decrease in bone density.  My cholestoral went up so that I now am on Lipitor.  My doctor felt I was so stressed from the side effects it was better to take nothing.  (The constipation goes without saying when you're on this many meds, and I was already depressed & on effexor before cancer so I can't blame that on the drugs.(",4
I have had alot of neuropthy in my feet and hands but after 18 months it is finally getting better . My biggest concern now is my hair is really getting thin.I did lose all of it from chemobut it come back normal. Is there anything I can do?,4
"I have been on aromasin for almost 5 years and I am going to ask to discontinue it when I have my 6 month follow up with my oncologist even though he would like me on it for another 5 years.  I have tollerated the side effects as long as I can.  I am 54 years old and feel like I am 80.  The fatigue, joint pain,brain fog,depression,sleeplessness have notdiminished like my oncologist said it probably would.  I also have a new problem that I am certain is related to taking aromasin. I am developing hard lumps on the joins of most of my fingers.  Has anyone else had this happen and if so would appreciate your input on that.",3
"I have been on Femara 5 mths and Aromasin 5 mths. It has been horrible! Hand, and almost every joint in pain. Basiclly my hands have been to me like a invalid. Felt like I was wearing boxing gloves, could nopt close my hands have not worn my rings in 9 mths. All my fingers are trigger fingers also both thumbs. Wrist very bad also now my foot and ankle. I stopped drug. I have no life with this! Now I will have a life. What will be, will be! I really tried to over-come but could not.",2
"I had minus Stage 1 breast cancer in 2/09 and started on Aromicin in 6/09.  I have very bad leg pain and also knee joint pain which is partly due to arthritis.  I do have a question however.  The doctor has put me on 2000 mg of Calcium, 400mg of Magnesium and 1000mg of Vitamin D.  I wonder whether this also is contributing to the pain. Any ideas?",4
I have been on Aromasin for 5 years and am considering going off of it. Is there any reason to remain on the medication after this time.,5
"Did 2 years on Tamoxifen, Aromasin has eliminated many side effects I had with Tamoxifen. But also created many new ones. Joint pain is sometimes unbearable, however the alternative is worse.  I do exercise regularly and it helps.  Got 1 and 1/2 year to go........I will survice",4
"I was on Arimidex for 9 months.  Had a lot of joint pain in my hands and feet.  Also had trigger finger in my thumb.  I talked to my oncologist and he switched me to Aromasin.  I've been on it one month.  My hands and feet are better and my trigger finger is going away.  However, I got the flu during the changeover period and I am so tired I don't even comb my hair.  I can't function with this fatigue and my family doesn't understand how tired I am.  I don't know if I can do this....",3
"I am 54, took arimidex for nearly a year, side effects to awful, changed to exemestane (aromasin) for last 4 months similar symptoms.Depresion, joint and muscle pain and stiffness, very tired all time, sleep not good, not happy at all. Came off drug for one month, much to family and medical professionals objections, now back on - to save my life? Consultant suggested I try rose hip capsules to help with pain, only started on them a week ago and back on my drug today.  He also suggested accupuncture, I have booked in at the penny Brohn Cancer Care centre nr Bristol for 4 sessions in Dec.  Can I put up with this for another 3 and half years!! Still going to the gym nearly every day, if I stop for too long my body ceases up!  Difficult for friends and family to understand how I feel as I look ok and going to the gym.  Life is a nightmare. Watch comedy videos, go to gym, meditate, yoga, tai chi, go to bed early, I live on my own and its mighty hard. Wake in morning and think oh no not another day to get through. Normally, I am a very positive person, full of beans and very happy.  I will maybe live for another 40 years so I am hoping that I can stick with this drug.  Any body any ideas how to help?  If I benefit from the rose hip/accupuncture I will let you know. Best of luck to you all x",3
I have had no side effects that I have noticed. My skin is a little drier. So I drink more water. Tamoxifen gave me flu-like symtoms.,5
"I began with Femara which caused foot pain so that I could hardly walk--very bad.  I switched to Aromasin which has given me just about all the side effects to one degree or another.  The onco nurse twice told me that the more side effects one has, the better the drug is working, but she had no hard facts for it.  I find that difficult to believe or understand, especially when I found 2 opposite studies on the internet (and, of course, the internet is always factual!).  Nevertheless, I hate this drug because it makes me feel like ""you-know-what"".  I have to talk myself through each day.  My arthritis has been nicely controlled for 15 years, and now, suddenly, I had extreme knee pain and I now have no more cartilege which equals 2 knee replacements. The Radiology onco said it was due to chemo--maybe like a little PacMan eating up all the cartilege?  I don't know, but strange that everything went down hill just after I started the Femara. Altogether I have been on the aromatase inhibitors for just over 6 months.  My concern is the long-term effects on my body, particularly what it is doing to my adrenal glands.",2
Lots of hot flashes where I feel like my body is combustible.  Pain in joints and back.  Fatigue.  Brain fog and memory loss.,4
"I suspected the changes I have been feeling as described in the literature,i.e., hot flashes, sweating, joint/bone/muscle pain hair loss and tiredness are unwelcome but I have to agree they are better than the alternative.  My Oncologist prepared me for these side effects.  I was placed on Femara first and had an allergic reaction, that included itching all over, rash and hives that resolved when Femara was discontinued.   I have only been on the Aromasin slightly over a month.  First 2-3 weeks I felt tired but the other side effects did not occur until the end of 3rd and 4th week. I suspect that is when the medication was becoming effective in decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers.  Obviously, I am hoping that as time goes on I will not continue to have as many hot flashes, not sweat as much, etc. Only time will tell. 5 years seems a long time to have the severity and frequency of the side effects.  I continue to work full time but the enjoyment from my work has certainly dipped while experiencing these side effects.   ",4
"stage 1 BC, node negative. I have taken Aromasin for 2 1/2 years. I had some joint pains but they were manageable. I have short term memmory loss which is very disconcerting. I have a well balanced healthy diet and excercise. I am 72 years old, not overweight and have a positive attitude. I receive yearly infusions of Reclast to prevent bone loss, a side effect of aromatase inhibitors. The result this year showed a 10% increase in my spine. I suffred from mild depression and am on 50mg of Zoloft which seems to help. At this point my quality of life is not effectet so much as to discontinue the medication.",4
"I have been taking Aromasin for 5 years post chemo (Stage III BC). Initially had more joint pain (hips, knees) but managable & has decreased. Still get night sweats now and then. Have not had a problem with weight gain or depression, so overall, I've been lucky with this. As I was at risk for osteoporosis before taking it & a dexascan a year after beginning it showed more bone loss, I've been taking Fosamax with good results. ",5
At 38 had a lumpectomy and chemo/radiation then tamoxifen. for breast ca.  At 42 had double mastectomy and refused any chemo. At 46 had breast ca with mets to both lungs.  Started with arimidix for 18 months and switched to aromasin because of joint pain.  had a lot of hot flashes as well.  I have been on aromasin for about 6 months and have been in complete remission since starting the arimidix.  I have increased facial hair growth that is getting worse and is very upsetting.  I do deal with depression but do have other family problems that contribute to my overall condition.  I was so scared when diagnosed with lung ca I thought that was it for me.  So both these meds along with lupron depot every three months have saved me.  My kids still have a mother and my husband with many health issues of his own still has a wife. My mother still has a daughter... Its still scary but I ll take the good and the bad with these meds.  I still have much to do.,5
OK  I HAVE NOT STARTED THIS ONE YET. I HAE BEEN ON ARIMEDEX FOR ABOUT I YEARS TAKING TIME OFF LIKE TWO WEEKS HERE AND THERE. I BECAME ILL WITH REALLY BAD FLU AND STOPPED ARIMEDEX ASKED FOR SOMETHING ELSE SHE GAVE ME PRES FOR AROMASIN  AFTER READING THIS ONE I THINK I WILL STAY ON ARIMIDEX I WAS NOT TOO DEPRESSED AND HAD NO TROUBLE SLEEPING BUT JOINT PAIN AND MODYNESS WERE BAD..AMASING HOW THEY TELL YOU JOINT PAIN IS NOT A SIDE EFFECT...WHENWE ALLHAVE IT!!!!,1
extreme/frequent hot flashes extreme/frequent night sweats insomnia edging to depression,3
"Hot flashes, cloudy mind, and restless nights. Do I really need this?",2
I am  very pleased with my response to Aromasin compared to Tamoxifen.  My energy level has increased dramatically and I have lost over 12 pounds since switching to Aromasin.  It is more effective than staying on Tamoxifen for five years.  I take calcium to protect from bone loss. debbie,5
"Advanced stage of Inflammatory Breast Cancer diagnosed in Jan 2003.  Had chemo, surgury, chemo, and radiation.  Went on Tamoxifin for 1 year, than switched to Aromasin. Was originally given 60% chance of reoccurance.  It is going on 5 years on Aromasin and no reoccurance.  Side affects, sweats, weight gain, sleep issues, and blood pressure changes.  I am more than willing to deal with the side affects if it keeps the cancer from reoccuring.  I will continue taking it until my doctor decides otherwise.  Hope my comments help someone to deal with the side affects.",5
Have the pain in joints and musles but found that by doing 20 minutes on my treadmill once a day takes care of the pain! I have to force myself to do it some days but if I go to the beach for a week and don't do the treadmill I have a lot of pain. The excercise takes care of the depression and weight gain too!!,5
"After reading the comments of others, I see that I am living with symptoms that I just attributed to getting old (no energy, weight gain, spiky bp, headaches, joint aches). Nothing intolerable, but annoying if I could actually feel better not taking it.  The thought of going thru BC treatment again isn't appealing, so am biting the bullet so to speak.",4
"I feel tired, joints ache, feet hurt, no energy at all.",3
"Massive weight gain,Yuck. All my joints ache, feet, fingers wrists, legs ect. Having a real hard time getting up from a seated position, It's like my body shut down and doesn't want to get moving again. I'm going to doctors, and he seems to think I could go back to work.  I work in a factory and I know I can't do it.  I'm 47 now. feel like I don't have a life. can someone give me any suggestions.  thanks for reading.  Tamera  ",5
"I had Stage I breast cancer and started on Femara in Sept. 2008.  It had it's side effects, so I asked to switch to Aromasin.  I started it in Dec. 2008 and have been on it since.  I am 48 yrs. old and feel 90! My side affects: I have gained 25 lbs., loss of energy to do any exercising. I am constantly tired (sleepness nights).  My joints ache, particularly the feet, wrists and elbows, knees, too. I am trying to stay on this for 2 yrs. Everyday, though, I try to decide, ""quality of life"" or ""take this for 5 yrs. and feel miserable.??"" I keep trying to do all my ""normal"" activites...trying to walk, play tennis, biking, etc., but it hurts.  I am taking some 200 mg. of Motrin to help with the pain.  I guess I have to be thankful I'm alive.",4
"I feel terrible to say the least...I ache so bad and feel like I have the flu, arthritis, bad knees, you name it...and then I am hot and steamy , can not get comfortable. I wonder if it means the drug is working? Only been three months and I am miserable and very sad to even complain. Afterall it is supposed to help me, right? I know it is not like Chemotherapy, and am grateful not to have had that treatment..but how can I exercise when I can barely get up and walk? Five years of having a fever and aches and pains from that little pill? I sure hope it works.",3
"Took Femarra and developed sensory neorapthy. Went onto Aromasin and am at 5 years on it after 5 years on Tamoxiphen.  No reoccurance of Lobular Cancer so I feel lucky. Plenty of aches and pains of joints, depression but Chemo of Taxol had much worse side effects.  To keep the cancer away, you can make it.  For sweats, Effexor works.  I took it with Tamoxiphen.  I had cancer at age 58 and am now 69.  Ten years is well worth the aches and pains.  Exercise regularly and that helps.  Taking Naproxen also for arthritis. The Brain fog isn't as bad on Aromasin and its hard to say if it is the medicine or just aging. People without cancer have memory loss at 69 also I find. If my feet (which are numb from the Taxol) were better and I had better balance, I could do fine.  When I go off the Aromasin in May, we will see what happens.  Good luck to all. Everyone who ""stays"" on the medicine clears the way for improvements.",5
I was first placed on Arimidex which is very similar to the Aromasin.  I began having very bad headaches like migraines but they would not respond to any medications including my migraine medication.  After 3 months I stopped and started on the Aromasin.  After only 3 doses of this I started having the really bad headaches again so my doctor told me to stop this also.  Now they are trying to decide what to try me on next.  Five years is just too long to deal with the really bad headaches.,3
"I had lumpectomy with chemo and radiation 6 years ago. Took Tamoxifen for 2 years, and Aromasin for the past 4 years.  Have experienced stiff joints, weak wrists, hand swelling, lethargy, depression, vision blurryness and most troubling--memory loss and general ""brain fog"".  It has affected my ability to do my job, and my family quit expecting me to remember anything a long time ago!  I've thought all this time that it was a side effect of the chemo, but now I know there is hope that I can feel better after reading all these comments.  Wish I had found this web site sooner.  Saw my Oncologist yesterday, and plan to stop Aromasin right away.  I don't see the value of living longer, if I'm in a fog for the rest of my life.  Thanks for your comments!",5
"After reading the posts, I guess I'm lucky. Switched from Tamoxifen to Aromasin six months ago. Some depression, some sore ankles but MUCH better than tamoxifen. The only downside is the weight thing... oh yeah and the blood pressure spikes.",3
"I am  a 64 year old  7 year survivor of inflammatory breast cancer.  I have had two mastectomies, 6 rounds of CAT, 3 rounds of FUMEP (Mitomycin C, Cisplatin, CF/5-FU and VP-16), 7 weeks of radiation and 12 weeks of Herceptin/Navelbine.  I have been taking Aromasin for over 5 years with no major problems.  I do suffer from tinnitus (ringing and fullness in ears), but my minere's disease causes these sumptoms also.  These symptoms could be related to the Aromasin tablets also.  I just can't be sure  without halting the Aromasin----which I do not plan to do.  My oncologist is allowing his patients to stay on the Aromasin longer than the  5 years.  The test results only span the 5 year period----so I guess there is a risk of the unknown in continuing.  I also think there is a risk of the unknown in halting----I have been cancer free for years and don't want to change anything at this point. Good luck to each of you survivors-----my prayers are with you.   ",5
"I started taking aromasin in June 2008 for stage one breast cancer in the second breast.  For the first 4 months the side effects were minimal.  However I am now in the 10th month and have joint pain, weak wrist, depression, lethargic, no energy not even to do my exercise that I have always enjoyed.  The biggest problem for me though is my blood pressure has gone up and I can't seem to get it under control.  I have had to change my blood pressure medication twice and nothing is working for me.  I am 67 years old and seriously thinking about stopping the medication and just taking my chances.  I can't see myself living like this for the rest of my life....there is no joy anymore.",1
"Two lumpectomys, bilateral mastectomy, lymph node dissection, chemo, radiation and 2 years of breast reconstruction attempts. Thank you all for your reviews.  I cried because I know your pain.  Extreme joint pain.  Now I understand the depression.  Still cancer free though.  I've always had weight issues.  Took it as long as I could.  I'll stick with Tamoxifen.  What's a little sweat.",5
"I started on Arimidex and couldn't tolerate the extreme joint pain, daily diarrhea, headaches, loss of smell and taste and constant fatigue.  Doc changed me to Aromasin, which seemed more tolerable, but after six weeks I had joint pain, fatigue, weight gain and then exploded in a horrible lumpy, itchy rash of a drug reaction.  It will take three weeks to flush that out of my system and I don't want to even think what a ""next trial"" pill might do, so I think I will just take my risks and try to have some quality of life while I can.",1
This is my 3rd try with aromatase inhibitors. Joint pain with arimidex.Joint pain and chronic diahrrhea on both femara and aromisin. Has anyone else had any GI problems?,1
Severe bone pain and fatigue.,5
I have been on this medication about 6 months and I hate it. My joints ache constantly and I'm having a hard time sleeping. It is also very expensive. My Dr. wants me to get exercise most days and maintain my weight which I am trying to do. I will keep taking it because I don't want to lose my cancer battle but the side effects are very hard.,4
"After being on Tomaxafin for 2 1/2 years I was switched to Aromasin. I have been on it for about 5 months and my fingers and toes ach so much mostly in the morning and evening I cannot close my hands and cannot open a door, jar, or pick up anything of weight. I have experienced more weight gain and I want to quit NOW! I will be talking with my Oncologist in January about this. I'm very dissappointed with this new medication. ",2
"I have been on Aromasin for 4 years now and some of the symptoms others state they have I have had but not to the point I can not stand it. I am on a BP patch, have had weight gain, on meds for migraines (was before Aromasin), do have leg and muscle cramping but cant point it to Aromasin like everyone else has. I like it if it is what has kept the cancer away!!!",4
back and knee pain,2
"I've been on Aromasin for about 5 months.  At first I had no problems.  Now my joints are so sore, especially my knees.  Have no strength in them.  I want to discontinue, I can't tolerate it anymore.",3
"I have been on Aromasin for three years, after having started on Arimidex.  Aromasin has been so much easier for me.  However, lately my blood pressure is all out of wack...up high...down low...severe headaches too!  Has anyone noticed a difference in their blood pressure?  I'm already on three meds and can't stand the headaches!  Not to mention how unsettling it is to have your blood pressure going up & down.  ",3
MAKING ME DIZZY,3
"After my mastectomy in December, 2006, my oncologist prescribed arimidex for me.  I took it for six weeks.  Could not tolerate side effects and was almost in a week chair.  Then went on Femara.  Four months later same side effects but worse.  Just took longer to get there.  Have been on aromasin since August, 2007.  Fairly tolerable but have gained weight with mild hot flashes or power surges.  Recently I have been starting to have problems with my vision getting blurry.  This past weekend, my left eye is far more blurry and my left eyelid is drooping.  No other symptoms of problems.    I do know that aromasin has a steriod base and also has a warning on the label.  None of the other AIs have that warning.    I also have become more depressed and more tearful in the past month.  I also started a blood pressure medication this past month also and wonder if this could be an interaction problem with the two meds. ",2
"After 2 1/2 years on Tamoxifen, I have been on Aromasin for 3 years with plans to stay on a full five.  I have a definite weight gain but after the misery of hot flashes, etc. with Tamoxifen, this is great.  I too have fatigue at times and some joint discomfort, but I am alive to feel it and  that is the bottom line for me. ",5
"Has it worked? Yes, no recurrance; is it easy to use? Yes, one little pill a day; overall satisfaction? dissapointing. I am at the end of the 5 yr therapy, and have endured pain and fatigue the entire time. The past 6 months have revealed now that I have some severe short-term memory loss (to the point of forgetting that my daughter-in-law was pregnant!), confusion, and I've been wondering if the Effexor is even working. Will see a neurologist to see if progression can be stopped. Congrats to all the survivors out there, and thanks for sharing - I wasn't aware of the many serious side effects and literally thought I might be going crazy. My oncologist has taken me off it immediately, since in my case, the side effects DON'T outweigh the risks! ",5
I started taking Aromasin after starting out on arimidex.  With Arimidex I had horrible hot flashes almost constantly and bad joint pain and stiffness with weight gain.  On Aromasin the hot flashes are fewer and the joint pain and stiffness is not as severe.,3
"I have bee on Aromasin since end of March.  I have been experience all over joint pain/body aches. Mainly knees, elbows, wrists. Still working out regardless of the pain.  Some slight weight gain. Seeing a rheumatologist and has put me on Celebrex 200 mg once a day and also taking a pain reliever at night when needed.  ",3
After 3 months of taking aromasin I developed a painful wrist.  My Oncology has advised me to stop two weeks ago and the pain of my wrist is still there. What should I do,1
"WHAT A NITEMARE!AFTER 1 MO. ON AROMASIN I DEVELOPED A HEADACHE WITH LOUD EAR RINGING. SAW A NEUROLOGIST AND AFTER 8 MRIS , A CATSCAN, A SPINAL TAP,3 BLOOD PROFILES..I WAS CALLED A 'MYSTERY' THEN I REMEMBER I STARTED AROMASIN 3 MONTHS BEFORE.MY BRAIN FLUID EVEN DECREASED.I KO I'M SENSITIVE TO DRUGS BUT OTHERS I SEE HAD HEAD AND EAR TROUBLE,I JUST HOPE IT GOES AWAY.",3
"This has cause a lot of pain. I have gain a lot of weight, my good arm went numb, my feet feel like I'm walking on  hot nails. my face swells, and so dose my feet.",5
"I've been taking Aromasin for almost 3 yrs now.  I do not know if it has been effective or not, I have no signs of a recurrence.  What I have developed in the last 6 months is severe depression, which has not been helped by medications.  Also am experiencing severe anxiety and hot flashes that are more frequent than while taking Tamoxifen.  Depression has been treated with Wellbutrin with Cymbalta, then Wellbutrin 200 mg twice a day with some anxiety meds also.  Nothing is stopping me from crying every day.  My oncologist just shakes her head, like this is all normal.  I tend to disagree as I was always an upbeat person before this.  I can't imagine why it is so much worse in the past 6 months.",3
"I began with Tamoxifen, then moved to Arimidex.  Joint pain was localized in both ankles.  The pain did not restrict my work-outs, but certainly added to my discomfort.  I then moved to Arimidex.  The joint pain is now in my wrists and appreciably reduced in my feet and ankles.",5
The headache and buzzing inside the head was unbearable. I made an apt with a neurologist.Some nausea but the headache responded to no treatment.I give up on it.,1
"I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33.  I was also pregnant.  After chemo, I was placed on Tamoxifen.  After one year of Tamoxifen I still had no side effects.  With no menopausal side effects my doctor felt that it may not be working for me so he suggested I have my ovaries removed.  I have now been on Aromasin for about 2 months.  I do not seem to have any side effects from it.  I have some hot flashes but they are very mild.  I hope that things continue this well.",4
I am tired I finished treatment in Oct. but Im also on Coreg is this why I am tired?,5
my joints ace and i keep getting yeast infections and later I was told this medication has triggered herpes and I cannot understand this when I have not had sex form or fashion in 30yrs.,5
"I had terrible symptoms with tamoxafin and was put on aromasin as soon as we knew menapause was done. The body aches, joint pain are less severe but my bone density has decreased 9% in the last 2yrs. Fatigue and depression are my big complaints. My Dr. put me on effexor which has helped tremendously with depression and also hot flashes and nite sweats.",4
"switched from Femara last Nov. it's still early but i'm still experiencing some joint pain, weight gain but with assitance from sleep meds sleeping much better. still experience fatique. PMS-like effects less pronounced with this medicine. ",4
Muscle aches in various parts of my body stiffness all over,5
"I have experienced numbness in my hands and feet, which my oncology office said was not a side effect of this med, now I learn from this website that it is.  I also have very stiff joints and swelling in my legs and hands, pain in my wrists, and all around low energy.",5
"so far so good as far as the breast cancer, no recurrence but a lot of joint pain",4
"I have tried Arimidex and switched over to Aromasin because I became so depressed.At first I tolerated it better but now the same symptoms are appearing.Depression, nausea, fatigue. I am 68 and wonder if I need to take anything to make me feel so lousy or am better off taking my chances. Anybody out there with similar experiences?",1
"I just finished my 3 yrs on arimidex after 2 yrs on tamoxifin..only suffered joint aches, but glad to be finished, joining a clinical trial for 5 yrs on letrozole, wish me luck",5
"I am in my 1st 6 mos. of using Aromasin after 2 & 1/2 yrs on Tamoxafin.  I am dealing with significant joint and bone pain (which is like a throbbing tooth ache, and   am limited in physical activities because it hurts to move.  I keep telling myself I can do it for the prescribed 2 & 1/2 yrs, but sometimes I have trouble feeling positive about the idea.   I'm 64, and I really hope that when I'm done with all of this, I will still be ""young"" enough to feel good and begin enjoying an active lifestyle again.",4
hair loss and fatique and very expensive,2
Other than tired and some hot flash moments I tolerate this med well. ,5
"I have been on this medication for over a year and not thrilled with the side effects.  It seems that it attacks all my joints and my sciatica.  I wake up every morning with a different pain.  I have also been cancer free for two years so I guess it is working.  I think I hit lotto with the side effects You name it , I got it depression, joint pain, tiredness etc..  Its very rough being on this meds.",3
I have been on the drug for 9 years now with one more year to go. I have all of the side effects. The worst one is excessive sweating. Also I have had an increase in my weight. Not sure if this is from the drug or just post cancer or fatigue. Blessed that the drug is available.  ,3
taking aromasin post breast cancer/radiation - I was expecting the sweating due to the onset of menopause anyway so scratch that off. However the only other issue I'm having is back pain - driving me crazy. Advil helps a little but not much. Other than that everything else is fine.,5
"Had a breast reduction and lab found two types of cancer.  It was very small and didn't go to lymph nodes.  Since they couldn't determine where in the breast it was found I had a mastectomy.  I had debilitating pain with first drug.  Have been taking exemestane since November 2016.  In June 2017 developed pain in hips feet and wrist.  It took some time for me to think of the reason.  Called my doctor and he advised me to stop.  Will start another medication in a few weeks.  I thank God the cancer was found.  With the pain I have from this medication, I can't imagine what other women have gone through taking other medications with side effects. ",3
I have had a double mastectomy this year with no implants.  I have had a total mastectomy 10 years ago.  Why am I taking this drug?,2
"I had to stop this drug after 5-6 weeks.  Awful hands joints pain and I couldn't use my fingers at times.  One elbow hurts.  Hot flashes. The worst is the bladder issues. I have been on 3 different antibiotics with no relief.  I feel like I have a bladder infection but I don't.  I read where the bladder needs estrogen to stay healthy so now I think I have interstitial cystitis and need to see a urologist.  I am running to the bathroom often and feel like I need to go all the time. My family doctor has prescribed an anti spasm bladder drug and I have AZO which helps but I don't want to continue taking drugs.  Of course my oncologist says it isn't the aromasin.  If not what is it because I did not have any of these problems before taking aromasin.  Then he says the drug is out of my body in 60 hours and the side effects are gone within 120 hours.  It has been 2 months and I still feel bad and I know from previous issues with another drug it can take up to a year for my body to get better. I believe this drug damaged my joints and bladder and will take months to heal, something my oncologist does not agree with me on.  I am not going to take this drug or any other estrogen blocking drug.  ",3
I took anastrazole first and symptoms were almost non existent until about the 9th month - then severe muscle aches and pains.  Went off of this for 1 month. Oncologist prescribed exemestane. I took it for 2 weeks and pain was unbearable. I stopped taking this also.  It has been several weeks and my wrists still hurt. Doctor ordered full body nuclear bone scan. Thankful to God it did not show bone cancer but oncologist wants me to continue taking this medicine and I can not do it.  The pain is too great.  Not sure what I will do - dont want to get breast cancer again but I can't tolerate the drugs.,1
"I put 1's bc to leave blank may have prevented views. I was only on for 1 week and from day 2 experienced hot flushes, headaches, stiff neck, hypertension,and irritability. The flushes, headaches, and stiffneck became progressively worst to the point that I went to the ER bc pain in jaw and numbness in left arm, was admitted and full cardio work up. I kept telling the tx doctor and my oncologist who prescribed and that this event was a result of the hormone meds. Tx md agreed but oncologist denied. Stopped meds 2 days ago symptoms abating after getting worst for a few hours.I'm  scared got metastatic cancer in spine and rib. Starting oral chemo this week.",1
"I've been on this drug fir two months. The only side effect I have noticed is hot flashes. Some days they are horrible, followed by sweat dripping, I could take showers all say long. Other days, not so bad. There is really no pattern. I'm trying to stay active with a lot of walking. I have aches & pains, but I did before. Normal, for 68 yrs old. I keep watching my hair, I have thin hair & hope it doesn't get thinner. I will take this & try to stay positive, I don't want cancer back.",5
I get extremely tired very quickly. Have joint pain,3
"On tamoxifen 2 years and started this at year 3. Took it for one year and developed joint and muscle pain, fatigue, trouble sleeping and loss of sex drive. It really hampered an active lifestyle I enjoy. Went off for 6 weeks ( doctors suggestion) and am happy to say I have improved immensely. Switching back to tamoxifen as for my final year of treatment!",1
I have been on medication for almost five years and happy to say I have been cancer free. Not sure how long I will be on it. Just recently I have been having some hair thinning. Not sure why now. Otherwise side effects minimal compared to chemo. ,5
"On med two months but had to discontinue due to side effects. Severe sleep issues, fatigue, depression, some joint and muscle pain,nausea, headaches, and just no energy. Had not felt these problems before the medication and were all clearly due to the med.  Was affecting my ability to work. All of the side effects are diminishing not that I've discontinued. For me and my cancer stage stopping med was a good decision. ",1
this is the worse medication ever. It causes me pain all over my body. was not able to sleep for months. stopped it andwill never take it again. ,1
"It's hard to give a satisfaction rating when you don't really know if it's working or not.  Only future tests will show it's worth. On this drug for two months now and feel lethargic most of the time and have to push myself to do anything.  Sleep is okay; do get warm at night but no dramatic hot flashes.  My mind wanders, I've noticed changes in my skin, more wrinkles, thickening of my facial skin and sometimes a little bit dizzy.  Compared to all the other reviews, my symptoms are mild, but I don't like feeling this way and wonder if this drug is creating other problems like heart disease and osteoporosis.  I used to have very good health (I thought) until breast cancer.  This is scary.",1
"I was diagnosed w/Invasive Lobular Carcinoma in June 2013. HER 2+ and ER positive. in half of my lymph nodes. Chemo, Lumpectomy, Mastectomy then radiation. I started on this medication and have bone and joint aches. Stiff fingers and hands. A little swelling in my hands not too bad. Hair thinning, slight headaches once in awhile. Hot flashes and insomnia quite a bit. Able to deal with though. Headaches at times. However, thankful for every bit of it. This is only temporary. You will feel better!",4
"I've been on this drug for 2 months after chemo & radiation.My breast ca.was in my had spread to my nodes so I'm on the drug for 5 yrs I had trouble with nausea but now it is my cholestrol is going up on this drug,I can't stop taking it. I have had some insomnia but I will survive I have two friends that have triple negative breast cancer so I feel rather blessed that I have the kind I do.I pray that they are close to a cure.",3
"I was put on a different after cancer/radiation drug. My body hurt so much I was going to stop taking it. This drug does not hurt my body, joints, muscles etc. so I am grateful. Only time will  tell on the other.",4
Been taking this for several months; have experienced some increase in my previous arthritis pain and stiffness but no other significant effects. Can't judge effectiveness as it is a preventive drug in my case - website requires entry. ,3
"This is the same as Aromasin. My generic is made by Greenstone not Pfizer.   I have had minor joint pain, dry eyes, trigger finger and cough. These have resolved within a few weeks. The major problems are insomnia(for which I take an over-the-counter product) and feminine dryness for which I use organic cocoa butter.)   It has been four months so far and I hope to take this for five years.",5
"I like that it is small and easy to take.  I do have rashes on my neck and stomach and groin area, which I wish they could fix. But my tumor is gone.",4
For the first 2 1/2 yrs i had horrible leg cramps that woke me every night. The cramps were even above my knees.  I have had lower back pain and am having trouble now with my hip joints and pain when standing. Trigger fingers (my thumb) was also a problem. I had difficulty holding on to things.,3
"I've been taking this med for about 3 months now.  I have experienced joint pain and hot flashes as expected.  However, the pain and flashes are relatively minor as compared to what I have already faced with chemo, radiation and 3 surgeries.  I've read many reviews on similar meds and many women are suffering.  I think the most important factors I've kept in mind are:  this is temporary and I'm strong enough to cope, the meds are helping to prolong my life, exercise helps with the stiffness/soreness as well as watching what I eat, mental and emotional wellness is also key.  I have a strong faith in my God and He is my strength when I can't do this on my own.  (And trust me when I say, I can't do this on my own.  :-)  I have also been taking the meds at night, so I wake up stiff and sore, but I'm able to get up, go for a walk with my dog and the walk helps loosen me up a bit.  I find that if I sit, stand, walk, lie down, etc. for too long a period, then I become sore and stiff.  I try to be mindful of this and keep moving...even when I don't feel like it.  At the risk of sounding like a medical pro, I have to say, in the long run, these meds are going to help and eventually become a memory.  Keep strong, ladies!  You've been through a lot and you can see this through as well.  I believe in you!  ~DeeAnn",4
"The past 18 months have been a nightmare for me. Sadly so many side effects have reduced the quality of my life that I have had to stop taking it 5 weeks ago. Today I had a chest xray to investigate the breathlessness. The insomnia is diminishing. Joint pains, sciatica, vision & memory problems, hair & nail loss, itching everywhere skin touches skin but particularly in the folds of my groin area, all continue. I have tried so hard as I desperately want to prevent cancer returning  now I just have to take my chances as I have previously tried 3 other similar drugs.",1
"Third med I've been on ... this one isn't as bad but still stinks.  joints of hands sore, can't get to sleep, sex almost impossible, constant hot flashes",5
"new medication, haven't started taking it,want to know about it first.",3
"I have been on this med. for 2 months. At first no real bad side effects.  1 month in now I have severe pain in both hands, legs & feet.  Can't sleep during the night.  I have had to have carpul tunnel surgery in both hands due to the numbness & tingling constantly.  Hands are always somewhat swollen even after watching salt intake, etc. Tamoxifen is my on alternative.  Afraid it won't be as effective.  Very confused.",2
My pharmacy switched me to this generic from another brand. I've had a huge increase in leg and joint pain. So much so that I went in thinking I had another DVT. The symptoms of the other pills were so much lighter I will ask to switch back to the other brand.,3
"The effectiveness question for this medicine don't make sense. I'm taking it to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer. So far its effective, but its like asking if you are immortal, you don't know until you die. I was on a different brand and had a little joint pain. since switching, my joints have begun to hurt and I now have swelling in hands and feet. Painful.",3
"it cause terrible pain in my left arm. my arm felt like it needed to be cut off. i cannot sleep thru the night without pain, difficult to use arm and terrible pain with certain movement.",3
can cause nausea and vomiting,3
"arthritis much worse in hips, kneesm ankles and feet.  soreness in calf and hip muscules.  extreme hot flas 1/2 hour after taking med.",2
"I have just finished the first of five years of treatment.  My arthritis is much worse and I have trouble sleeping.  If this med. helps me to remain cancer free, it's totally worth it and I will stay on it as long as necessary. ",4
I don't seem to notice any side effects.  My arthritis is no worse after taking Exemestane. I sleep well.  Maybe I'm just so happy to be through my chemo and radiation that it doesn't bother me.  If it keeps me from getting cancer again then thats what I want.  I do think keeping active is important both physically and mentally.  There's no sense dwelling on the negative.,5
"Went on Aromasin at first and did well with tumor reduction.  Then the generic version come out and it was not coated, so it bothered my stomach.  Still waiting to see if the reaction to the tumor is the same.  both brought on constant hot flashes. ",4
"Early Breast Cancer Treatment following surgery and radiation.  I have had pain in knees, legs, hips, lower back, fatigue, diguestive problems.  Effexor and prilosec have been prescribed for side effects.  They have helped.  I am 4 years into the 5 year plan.  Cancer-free so far!  Only one more year of treatment to go!  The plan is working and that is what is important.  I work full-time and maintain a busy life.  I just put one foot in front of the other and forget the pain.  After all, it's only for 1 more year.  Just keep counting them down, that's the secret.",4
"Been on this drug since Feb08 - 5months and have been reduced to a crippliing wreck so much so that I stopped taking them before seeing my Oncologist. When I did see him and tell him he agreed for me to take Tamoxifen.  Since the changeover Ihave gradually but very very slowly started to improve.  For me its the quality of life thats important and I couldnt envisage going on with the dreadfulpains in my knees, lower back (all previous areas of arthritis) theres a coincidence !!!!",2
administered 5 days a week iv no serious side effects went into remission seemed to work very well ,5
"I have experienced 5 of 6 main SAEs on this medication which I am taking with Zydelig in a clinical trial.   I had very bad diarrhea after the second infusion, and after completing the weekly rounds have found that I am having a bad diarrhea, vomiting,chills, fever situation for the past four months shortly after the infusion reaction,    I have spent countless hours I'll while on this product and am in the hospital for several days again as I write due to more medication interaction.",3
"I just finished my second infusion of Arzerra, So far, I have had the same experience with this drug and application as with Rituximab, which I tolerated well.  I have had none of the side effects that were listed in the Arzerra information.   I have six more weeks of infusions before I will get some follow up testing to see if it is effective.   ",3
"I was diagnosed in June of 2000 with CLL, and the possible Richters transformation of non Hodgkins Lymphoma by a tumor the size of a tennis ball at the junction of the cecum and Illyum in my intestines.  A surgery removed the tumor that had not metastasized and was followed with 8 treatments of CHOP chemotherapy.  I lived a painfree and normal life for 12 years follwing treatment.  I took a physical this past February and received a call from the Dr. asking me to come in and begin a series of tests to determine a relapse of CLL. (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia).  My initial symptoms involved chronic fatigue, mild night sweats to the neck and chest, and swelling of the lymph nodes on my neck and under my arms.  My initial WBC count was 75K.  A bone marrow biopsy and FISH flow analysis revealed the following markers: DL-38, ZAP70, P-17 deletion.  My decision to leave the well meaning strip mall oncology group rushing me towards treatment with FCR caused me to step back and seek a second opinion.  This led me to return to Sharp Memorial Oncology and Dr. Rice who completed her clinical residency at UCSD and Dr. Kips.  I met with Dr. Michael Choi who took the time to explain my CLL and associated markers completely, and worked diligently to enroll me in a clinical trial of Irbrutinib vs Ofatumumab.  I was chosen to receive Ofatumumab.  Started the treatment early Ocotber.  Slight initial reaction (itchy skin, achy, flu like symptoms) stopped the infusion, (I have an infusion port)increased benadryll infusion and then resumed. Overall I have tolerated the last 5 treatments very well.  My WBC was 145K at the first treatment, my WBS is now 20K! My platelet and neutrophyll counts are climbing, and I am very encouraged by the response and results of the treatment with Ofatumumab.  I am also so impressed with the Doctors and staff at UCSD Moores cancer center.  I will post future progress on this web site.  I highly recommend this treatment for relapsed CLL patients.  DRH",5
"I was so blessed to get introduced to this product from my local Kaiser Permanente Office by Dr. Lee P. Schelonka, MD. I am according to my care team, a perfect example as to how your amazing drug should work. I could not be more happy. In four years, this drug has calmed down a bad situation and actually improved my vision. I do think, however, that it is equally important that the doctor be bot only knowledgeable and competent, but trusting as well. Thank you so much for this drug! It has improved both the quality and the comfort of my life.  ",5
Only one eye injection so far. Already improvement. Wish I'd had this years ago when this started. Not pleasant to have. Two more injections to go. One a month.,4
"I have Idiopathic Chordial Neovasculaization which is non age related wet macular degeneration. I had just turned 33 years old when in one day my vision went from perfect to 140/20. I have now had more than 7+ injections each one worse then the one before. Mine are extremely painful as the doctor susp cts that I may be allergic to the idolize used to clean the eye after. While my vision has improved 80/20 I have other things going on with my body that are just not adding up. Such as: I've been losing a lot of hair, at first I didn't think much about it but now when I shower or brush my hair I have gobs of hair come out. Also I've noticed recently that eating certain foods that swollowing is very difficult and food is getting stuck in my throat. After reading things on here I am going to make an appointment with my primary care doctor and tell her my concerns. It's hard for me to acknowledge that I will be needing these inj crooks for the rest of my life.",4
"Just had my 2nd shot, which was more severe than the first. Maybe dosage was increased? Severe stomach pain, abdomen pain, so painful I finished off the Pepto Bismol at 1 am, and took two Alka-Seltzer at 5 am. The first short just caused fatigue, but the second makes me think about taking any more shots. Side effects are too drastic for me.",2
"I have diabetic retinopathy which has caused macular edema. My retina specialist initially used laser treatment to stop the bleeding in the areas not in the field of vision which was highly effective. However, in my right eye, there was bleeding in my field of vision where the laser can do damage. I have had about 10 Avastin injections over the past 20 months. The shot does not hurt as you get numbed up. Eye is sore for 12 to 18 hours after shot, but fine after 24 hours. I've had no side effects. The shots have been successful in managing the edema but it does wear off after 6 to 8 weeks requiring an additional injection on that schedule. The doctor's appointment to get the injection can be long (worst was 2.5 hours) as you need to do the vision check/OLT scan then get prepped for the shot, then get the shot. On a busy day at the Dr's office or if there is an emergency he's dealing with, it can be frustrating. Overall, an effective treatment regimen for me with no side effects. ",4
"I had my first shot May 25th 2017.  It was uncomfortable and had to keep my eye shut for 35 min.  I felt sharp pain too 2 midol and it subsided. Had to go back to Doctor was seeing a dark spot to right and bottom of eye. It was an air bubble I was told, from the shot and it finally went away.  I can see a little more from my right eye still a bit uncomfortable, using preservative free eye drops OTC and doubtful about continuing shots but still researching alternatives.",3
"After 1 injection into my eye, in less than a week after the injection I suffered from uncontrollable nosebleeds lasting up to 90 minutes of bright red blood pouring from my nose and mouth. I'm a truck driver so I would have to pull over and wait them out. It was very scary. My eye doctor denied that this medication had any side effects let alone nosebleeds. My PCP was baffled and sent me to an allergist. He stated that this medication's major side effect was in fact uncontrolable nose bleeds. I was then sent to an ENT doctor who cauderized my entire nose passages to attempt to stop the issue. It did and I would rather go blind then to be injected with Avastin ever again.",1
"I have received 2 shots in my right eye for WMD. Very good response so far. Not too painful, and so far no noticeable side effects. ",5
"Just had my fifth injection...not only has the drug stopped my macular degeneration symptoms (wavy lines, dim vision, and flashing spots)...problems have reversed and nearly disappeared. I had an aggressive onset of the disease...and could not be more pleased. My injections schedule has moved from monthly to every two months. Although getting injections in the eye is an unpleasant thought...the outcome has been excellent. ",5
"I am very young and was told by my retinologist I have Wet macular degeneration in my right eye. He started me on Lusentus and that was ineffective,then started me on Avastin (CHEMOTHERAPY!), which also proved to be ineffective and in fact, made me very sick! Within 2 weeks of receiving an eye injection, I had my first ever sinus infection and I was miserable. I wondered what was going on? Then, I did some research and discovered Avastin is chemotherapy and used as off label for WMD. It was ineffective and the side effects are horrendous! Never again will I let the doctor inject Avastin in my eye.",1
"I have had DMD for 5 years, within the past 6 months, both eyes have turned wet. About 4 months ago, had the first shot of avastin was in my left worse vision eye,although painful there was no change, and no problems. My better eye once I had the shot I had problems. Its been a week, my eye was inflamed, bruised, and really raw looking. I also have a small tire shape circle with a yellow middle, I have in my lower vision that is not going away after a week.I was very tired, and just felt sick for a few days after shot. Dependent on if there is any improvement, might just let nature take its course. ",2
"I had two injections-within two days of the injections I had sinus issues which lasted two weeks, my throat became tight,difficulty swallowing,horrible joint pain and felt tender spots on throat around thyroid.Right before the next appointment all of these symptoms disappeared. I had the next injection and experienced all of the same except this time the spots on my throat became worse. I made an appointment with my DR and had blood work done-my thyroid was in a hypothyroid state which is not the case months prior. My Dr also said I had nodules on my thyroid and should have further testing. I told him my suspicions and just like the Opthamologist he said those side effects would not be from the Avastin injections in the eye as it's such a small amount. I asked him to wait a month before doing the lab work again to see if my thyroid has improved. All of the symptoms disappeared after 5 weeks of my last injection and the nodules on my thyroid if there are no longer painful. My concern is that the drug would case permanent issues. I won't risk another injection",4
At 36 I had a retinal branch vein occlusion in my right eye and my eyesight which started to go blurry and I was losing my eye site which was very upsetting to me as I work on a computer for my job and had 20/15 vision my whole life.  I consulted with about 3 Dr.'s for treatment and they all suggested I get an Avastin shot in my eyeball.  I was very scared to do this but I took the Dr.'s advice and it was like a miracle.  I could immediately see perfectly again.  I had to have this shot twice.  It was not painful at all as they really numbed my eyeball w a q tip of numbing medication and I just didnt look at the needle.  It really worked for me and I do highly recommend it.  I can see perfectly again. ,5
"I am writing this review on behalf of my sister, now deceased because of Avastin.  Less than 2 weeks after her first and only infusion, she was rushed into emergency surgery for a perforated bowel.  Because Avastin interferes with healing, the surgeons made us well aware of the risk of surgery.  She passed away in the ICU 4 days after surgery.  ",1
"I was diagnosed with wet macular degeneration at age 65.  The Opthomologist recommended Avastin eye injections.  I was very nervous about getting an injection in my eye.  Let me state, right up front, this doctor I sm going to is supposed to be good but is a pompous jerk.  Actually, the eye is numbed, the injection itself is quick and I didn't even feel it.  A patch was placed over my overnight. This doctor injects under the upper lid. After the first shot, no pain but the top of my eye was red for a month.  Second injection, no problems.  Third and fourth injections, horrible discomfort and burning, clogged sinus on that side and horrible runnr nose.  This seemed to improve by the next day.  I just received my 5th injection today and am having the same horrible discomfort as I type this.  Came home and have been laying down for hours trying not to move my eye, even though it is patched.  Horrible burning, scratch feeling if the eye moved, plugged sinus, nose running, scratchy throat.  I told the doctor this before this last injection and he just to,d me I am over sensitive.  At one appt, he told me I was a big baby. Who does that??!!  I have seen some improvement and he says it has improved but my central vision loss is probably permanent.  I cannot find on the Internet anyone having problems like this after an injection.  I am almost tempted not to get any more of these.  Yes, should probably try to find a new doctor but hate to switch if the results are going to be the same.  I hope this discomfort is gone by tomorrow.  ",3
"Every time I get and injection in my eye hurts, Water streams out of my eye for 2 days. I get crust all around the out side of the eye. I dread my appointments. I feel like I am being tortured.",2
"I was given 5 years (maybe) to live after being diagnosed with brain cancer.  I first received Temodar, a spot returned on my MRI in 6 months.  I was then switched to Avastin.  MRIs have been stable for over 6 years now. Seven year ""thriver"" thanks to God, some great doctors, and a very good medicine.",5
"I have been receiving injections of Avastin for about 3 years. The first 3-4 treatments were by far the most effective. It seems to be maintaining a status quo situation ever since. However, I recently started seeing a new doctor due to insurance issues and was shocked to find out that there are many reasons not to have Avastin shots if you can avoid it. I have been doing some research since learning that, and indeed I have had many of the bad reactions that are discussed with regard to this drug. I never put it all together until now. Stomach issues, skin issues, bad eye issues including a very bad infection for which I didn't receive much help, overall feeling of illness.I took a 4 month break recently, and felt really good all that time. Just had another shot this week and am once again having stomach issues and not feeling well. Is there a connection? ",4
"Ihave had 2 injections so far and when I close my good eye, my left eye is still blurred. I am not sure whether I want another treatment or not. When they did a ultra scan on my left eye I could see red that nearly covered my eye.  My second treatment turned out to be very painful due to something they caLL DRY EYE.  i HAD TO GO TO Morgantown, wv to see what wS WRONG.  cAN ANYONE TELL me their experinces. Also I read where some maN HAD A STROKE AND HAVING THE EJECTION WHICH i DID NOT KNOW ABOUT.",2
"I'm 37 and developed a major greyed out spot in my eye.  I didn't go to the doctor for about 4 months hoping that it would go away.  Well, it didn't and in fact got worse.  As another review stated, the apprehension of getting the shot is worse than the actual shot.  The injection was quick and uncomfortable, but not painful.  I didn't notice any improvement for the first 3 weeks after receiving the injection, than noticed a gradual improvement.  I received my 2nd injection 4 weeks after the first and my vision has continued to improve.  Its improved so much so that the doctor already changed my injection schedule from once every 30 days to once every 60 days for the 3rd.  My vision is not 100% back to normal, but its improved enough to where it is not affecting my quality of life anymore.  I'm eager to know how quickly it would start to degrade after I stopped taking the injections, but I do not have that answer yet.  OVerall, I'm very satisfied with the results.",5
Metastatic colon cancer post chemo and radiation now with liver mets. Now treating with Avastin  with some mild side effects like cough.,5
Side effects of serious nature. It is not worth the pain inflicted by use.,1
"I was diagnosed with 4 stage breast cancer five years ago.  At that time I was given Cemo plus put on a trial with Avastin, I have been off of all chemo except Avastin for the past three years and have been cancer free since that time. I have had very few side effects from the drug and fortunately am doing very well.  I feel that Avastin is the reason I have stayed cancer free. ",5
My husband did not have the IV form but had it injected right into this eye for Macular Degeneration and one week to the day from having it done suffered a Lacunar Stroke and has right sided weakness. He was never told by the opthalmologist that the drug Avastin has not been approved by the FDA and if he had been he would NOT have agreed to the treatment. Judith R. Finzer (spouse),1
"Improvement immediately after first shot and now almost normal eyesight after 7 shots.  Doctor even surprised at the rapid improvement! Doctor wants to switch to EYLEA, but I have resisted the change since Avastin has worked so well.",5
MAY HAVE CAUSED INFARCT,1
Had two separate injections for wet macular degeneration.  The bleeding behind the macula increased substantially with each injection of Avastin.  I am switching to Lucentis hoping that it will stop the bleeding.,1
getting violent chills,4
Great effect after 1 dose. Dark spot has become hazy to opaque. Waiting to find out how effective dose #2 will be. Avastin price is right and assistance programs also available,5
"Shots in the eye are very difficult for me, however, if it saves my sight, it's certainly worth it.",3
This treatment has been very effective and i have been able to tolerate the treatment very well.,5
A week or so after my first injection (left eye) I developed 2 patches of red on my left cheek.  Itchy as all get out.  Visited 2 dermatologists but the patches were not in the derma range.  Visited a general practioner and he recommended a contagious disease specialist.  Have appointment next Tuesday.  Hopefully he will have an answer.,5
"I have been on low dose Avastin in a clinical trial since Aug 2010. I started with a mix of taxol, gemzar and avastin for 6 months where most of my cancer was resolved. Now I have my primary that is cavitating and about 6 tiny nodules that are kept stable (inactive) with avastin. It has kept my stage IV lung cancer in remission all this time.  My blood pressure is elevated but is controlled with medicine, I have pretty bad sinus pain especially in dry environments and I have muscle stiffness. But, these are all minor side effects and for the quality of life I have, I walk, swim, weight train...do anything I want to do, and I believe it is because of the avastin keeping me in remission. The reason why it's not so easy for me to use is because I have to travel and hour each way for a 1/2 hour infusion but I think I can deal with it :-)",5
I started at every 4 weeks and progressed to every 3 months. A big mistake as far as I'm concerned. After a year and a half of improvement there was dramatic loss. I am set for my next injection tomorrow and am hoping for the best after that. Anticipation of the first was the worst. After that a piece of cake.,4
"fter my right eye had gone, avastin has kept my left eye near 20/20 for about 4 years. One eyeball shot every 4-5 weeks.",5
"Had one injection (in eye). Have experienced confusion and light-headedness, plus discomfort and blurring.",3
"Clinical study with avastin every 21 days for re-current ovarian cancer. Started treatment when on chemo now have been just on avastin since Nov. 2011. Have not really have had any side effects. No increase in BP, only minor effect is runny nose. Hope to be approved for another 6 months.",5
"Vision has improved.  Spot has gone from very cloudy to transparant.  On my third year of treatment.  Makes me drowsy for 8 hours after shot.  One treatment caused excessive watering of the eye, but none since.  Very grateful for the medicine.",5
THIS DRUG HAS IMPROVED MY VISION FROM ZERO TO 20/70  I TAKE A SHOT OF THIS MED IN MY EYE ONCE A MONTH... I HIGHLY RECOMMED IT TO EVERYONE.,5
"Well the wife got her first shot today.  Gave it all threes because its too new for us to rate.  I honestly can not rate how effective it is or isn't yet.  We are well known in the retinal surgeon's office.  Now its a matter of whether its more or wife in the chair.  Though I don't have Wet AMD yet, I am a vet of 8 different eye surgeries, including 3 retinal detachments and likely have glaucoma.  One thing after reading these reviews I want to point out.  Having been there done something like that, DO NOT LET LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ADD TO FEAR!!!!  Speak up.  Ask questions.  Make them explain it to you again if you don't understand. YOU are just as important as anything else they have to do including their schedule.  So what if they are late, just be patient when they are late because someone else needs the same consideration.  In our case the wife works for a medical company and I know more eye lingo than I care to admit. lol",3
My husband had NSClC & only had 2 treatments with Avastin & hemmorraged to death. I would not reccommend it for anyone!!! If they've stopped using it for breast cancer they should stop using it for everything.,1
"I am a 52 yr old female w/colon cancer mets to my liver.  I was on Folfox w/Avastin for 7 treatments (every 3 weeks); Onc switched me to Avastin only (every 3 weeks).  I have had 4 treatments.  I have headaches and some problems with my stomach but other than that, nothing worse.  My CEA remains within normal range (so far btwn 1.3 - 1.6) and the MRI's show that my lesions are shrinking and the disease is stable.  Onc is talking about taking me off chemo for awhile after my 8th treatment.",5
Been getting injections in left eye for about 2 years now. Sometimes a little painful other times don't feel at all. Keeping my condition the same so don't plan on stopping.,5
"I have experienced pain from the injection in my left eye, but the results are very effective. I have 20/20 in that eye now after 12 injections. Drug makes me feel sluggish for about two days after. ",5
"vision seems somewhat improved, procedure a bit painful ",4
I receive Avastin IV every 2 weeks via port.  Recurring MRI scan get better and better. To God be the Glory.,5
In combination wit taxol I have taken avastin for the last 12 months. It prevents blood vessels from forming to cancer tumors so it is a very effective drug for me. So glad to have it,5
"only had 1 injection..very painful, also had blurred vision for @ least 24 hours,  also eye watered for @ least 24 hours.having to take tylenol frequently for pain now..",1
I noticed the first 2 weeks I have brain fog. Then it goes away.,5
"I have only had 1 treatment So far no side effects. I will not know if it working for 3 more treatments, I am also getting Taxol and Carboplatin",3
"I feel this drug has kept me alive! Have had 2 recurrences of the colon cancer, met to the liver (which it cleared up) and met to the lung.After having been on several different chemos I have been getting only the avastin for the past 3 or so years. My conditions remains stable without any changes to the spot on the lung. I am thrilled with this result! I have been lucky and never had any side effects.",5
DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE! My mother received two doses 7 months apart and had spikes in blood pressure both times.  It has taken 3 days in the hospital to try to get her blood pressure back to within somewhat normal range.  The second time her BP reached 250/125 and they thought she was having a stroke.,2
it is injected into my right eye in the very corner to stop the wet magular degeneration. there is bleeding from the retina. I have had 3 bad reactions from the injection. Confusion + blurred vison + pain. Could it cause the eye to become bigger? My right eye is now bigger than the left and it can be very painful.,4
Had plaque/radiation for melonoma in eye. Now receiving avastin injections for leakage in eye,3
"It has been 7 years with Dx of stage 4 colon cancer with 12  met  to the liver,this drug very well,I am living proof.",5
"Was on sutent for two years. It quit working with minor growth of tumors. Been on Avastin and Intron since March 2010.  First scans showed two tumors reduced in size, one by half.However, one tumor increased slightly.  Recent scans show two reduced in size and one stayed the same.  Very happy with this combination of treatments. Avastin has little to no side effects.  Intron kicks my butt.  Never 100 percent anymore.  But I'm blessed to be here 2 years and 9 months after diagnosis.",5
"I am 39 and was recently diagnosed with ocular histoplasmosis. Had 1 shot of Lucentis. The next month my dr gave me Avastin. Injection was not painful! However, was allergic to something in the shot. Eye swollen shut for 2 days, terrible headache for 6 days, throwing up for 4 days, bright red eye, swollen face, pain on left side of face, eye still very fuzzy looking. Will not be able to use this again. ",3
I have diabetic retinopathy in both eyes. With Avastin injections my eyesight has greatly inproved. The injections have been given every 3 to 6 months with good results. Occasionally (once in 3 years)I have laser surgery. My eyesight now is 20-25. Exercise (3-4 miles running daily and tight diet help) 61 years old 158lbs 32 waist.,4
The doctor is very conponent.,4
"My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer in Jan. 2010. Received 2 chemos plus Avastin. He started coughing up blood. So 2nd treatment, Avastin was eliminated. On March 25th he hemmorraged to death. It was a traumatic thing for me because he was at home. How often does this happen???",1
I have had 10 injections in the right eye and 4 in the left.  I still have 20/20 vision however the vesel keep coming back.  I cant wait until a new drug comes out that last longer.  The shots are not bad as long as the doctor does not hit blood veins.,3
My wife's doctor really wanted her to have the Avastin treatment for ovarian cancer even though it is not approved yet.  She had recurring ovarian cancer in the lymph nodes and was hoping to get more time between reoccurrences.  She had one treatment of Avastin and died within 2 1/2 weeks from bleeding out on 8/2/2010.  The Avastin may not have been the cause but please strongly consider the risk before allowing your doctor to use this for ovarian cancer.,1
"I have been taking this drug with minimal side effects for about a year and a half. I have had some abdominal pain, and acid reflux. Two things that I have NOT had in the past. I had mets to my lungs, which are completely clear now. I have had awful sinus issues. I have lots of sinus pressure and pain when I wake up in the morning. Really not too bad considering what chemotherapy was like. My finger nails are much more weak and brittle. I use to have great nails. I am eating a VERY healthy diet, lots of veggies. So I have felt pretty good on this medication, but still tired.",5
"My husband had his 1st chemo treatment of which one of the chemos was Avastin. Shortly after he started coughing up blood. So they stopped the Avastin. But he had a rare side effect & an artery in his lung ruptured & he bled to death. I will never forget it, because he was at home.",1
"have been treated for wet macular deg. for the past five and a half years with the result that my condition has remained stable for that time. Considering that wmd is a progressive disease, I am very happy with the result...slight discomfort after the treatment is alleviated with one dose of Tylenol...not bad.",4
"Have only had 1 injection so this evaluation will most likely be inaccurate. So far, my vision in the affected eye is no better and seems to be somewhat worse at times.I understand this is normal until you have had 3 injections. The experience was very unnerving to say the least! Some one needed to inform me that unlike the assumption that the eye is a fragile soft organ, it is a very tough organ! When the needle is pushed in, it feels as if it is pushing your eyeball upward! I had some discomfort as the medication was pushed in, but little after effects. No soreness or even redness and no pain at all. Sure hope this works not just for me but for all of us! ",2
"my father took first dose with his regular folfox chemo for his reoccuring colon cancer, about 12 days after he became very ill, no balance,dehydrated,vomiting,very loose stools, admitted in hospital for week, took over 6 weeks to recover. Worse treatment for cancer, CEA dropped but side effects not worth it, it's quality of life rather than quanity.  ",3
"I have been taking this drug for 30 months.  After 2 years, my blood pressure soared but is now is controlled.  Otherwise, I think it is a very kind drug with good results.  My cancer is under control.  I am a 11 year surviver of 2 primary bc tumors and one recurrance.",5
I had a stroke in my left eye and get shots of Avastin.  The shots only last for about 6-7 weeks and then I have to get another one.  The shot causes really bad floaters so I don't want any more of them.,5
"other than headaches and lower back pain, I am completely satisfied with this drug",4
"I've been on avastin and abraxane for st.4 breast mets to spine,neck,on lung etc.going on my 5th month. I also had radiation at the same time,which was the worst for me. My tumor markers went from 200 down to 71 as of last week.Blurred vision and pain behind eye and boney pain but I don't take pain killers as I'm allergic to most of them. MMy blood has been fine and few side effects. So far I think it's working. I go for another cat scan of the chest on Monday. Hey, I'm still alive and kicking!   ",5
I receive Avastin every two-weeks via port.  ,5
"hello, I have been getting this therapy for about 4 months and the side effects are the worst ever. since I've been getting avastin, I have had, besides the hand and feet neropathy, uncontrolled nose bleeds. I have been in twice in the past week for nasal cauterization with silver nitrate, which is like snorting pepper, with no help. am supposed to change drugs this monday, will let you know if it helps and what it is. (chemo-brain has erased the name for now!)",3
The avastin shot has work a lot better for me than the lucentis shots.  They lasted for 6 to 8 months where the lucentis only lasted 1 month.,4
"I am 73 yrs. old and have (AMD) ""WET"". I have had three shots in my left eye and although the AVASTIN shots stopped the bleeding, my vision has improved only marginally. I am well pleased with the shot procedure(no pain at all) and glad that the bleeding has almost stopped.",5
I was using Bevacizamab as part of a clinical trial to treat recurrant ovarian cancer.  I had 7 treatments with carboplatin/gemzitabine/bevacizamab and 2 treatments of bev only after that.  CA125 went up significantly and cancer increased 10%.  I have discontinued bev but now find that I have constant stomach pain.  I'd like to hear if this is common among other users.,1
31 yr old female experienced vag bleeding enough to have to have my uteris burned out ,3
"Ijust had my first shot, scary but not bad.  the problems afterword were much worse than the shot. pain in eye, redness, itching and scratchy feeling. Hope this works.went to wmd without knowing about dmd. I am 60yrs.old                                                                 ",1
"I was 43 when diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer that spread to the liver. I was given little hope. My Oncologist said I had nothing to lose so lets try a trio of drugs, I had oxilaplatin, Xeloda and Avastin. I had terrible reaction to oxilaplatin and stopped it after 3 months. However after 3 months of these three my tumors were GONE. I continued with avastin for 8 months and avastin for almost a year. The tumor returned slightly in the esophagus and it was decided to remove the espohagus. I went thru the surgery in July and am now back to work fulltime. I am being told it is very unlikey that the tumors will return. The side affects of these drugs my cause swelling in extremities and stomache upset but I am grateful I found someone willing to try to save me for my family. I am having the blood checked every 4-6 months with petscans every 6 months but my cea has been consistent at 1. You have to try to believe and NOT give up hope. People can and do survive YOU CAN BE NEXT.",5
"This medication was first used in a clinical trial when diagnosed in stage 3b.  This proved to be ineffective.  It was again used for 4 months when the disease progresed to stage IV.  Once again, there was no benefit to this drug.  The potential for hemorage is always there with this drug.  This drug was described to us as a very effective treatment.  I think this med is overated. After reading other reviews, with few exceptions, few people are benefitting from this drug.  If you are in stage IV, make sure you maintain quality of life. This drug is given with Taxol.  Please make sure it is the right thing to do.  God Bless. ",1
I have had 3 treatments with avastin along with weekly treatments of taxol.  I am also on coumadin for a blood clot in my lung.  My nose began hemoraging and didn't stop until I went to hospital and had surgery. Avastin has been stopped temporarily. I would'nt reccomend taking Avastin with coumadin. The severe bloody nose was horrible. ,3
 injected into the eye. Stops bleeding of the arteries trying to form after a blood clot plugged part of the supply to the retina ,5
"I have stage 2 breast cancer, in the lymph nodes and hormone positive. I agreed to take Avastin as a blind trial study alnog with my 20 week chemo treatment. I took it once every three weeks throug IV with my other chemo drugs. first 4 doses of A/C and then 12 weeks of Taxol. I have been taking it for 5 doses with out the others and I am now realizing the side effects. Severe swelling in the left foot and ankle and very painful to walk. Sore muscles all over the body. And most recently high blood pressure to the point that they said I could not have my last dose. I am going to stop the Avastin. And will be checked for gout in my foot and other joints. I had taken 13 doses.",2
"Avastin  drop put into eye(for macular degeneration)...immediate reaction itching , shaking, hives over body within 5 min, difficult brething",1
"I'm a 57 yr old male that had no choice but to start treatment with this drug. All blood vessels were ruptured. Started first shots on right eye and all seem to go well, following week had left eye but after a few days it became completely blood shot. Not sure if this is normal, have contacted the Dr, waiting for a response as I'm typing this. Have four more treatments to go.",3
have not been off treatment long enough to know anything,3
i have had  two  shots  do  not  see  a lot  of  differance  still hoping,3
Has helped my condition although has had side effects.,4
"If you are considering using this drug for treatment for an eye condition, PLEASE do your research before consenting to use this drug.  It was used on my 3yr old daughter's eye and has done more harm than good. She is now blind in the eye it was used on. So if Avastin has been brought up to you as a treatment option, please ask questions and do your research! I'd hate to see anyone else go through what I have and suffer a loss.",3
It has slowed the growth of my tumor. I think its miraculous,5
"I have had seven IV treatments of Avastin in the past three months.  I have stage 4 breast cancer and had a tumor in my liver.  After four treatments the tumor had died and there were no new ones.  My tumor marker had gone up to 50 however.  After two more treatments the marker was down to 41.  I have had some stomach pain but nothing serious.  I have a bloody nose which is just irritating.  Four of my fingernails have separated from my fingers about halfway back, and it looks like the same is going to happen with some toenails.  My blood pressure went up and I'm on medication for that.  I'm getting taxol too, so it's difficult to tell which drug is causing some of the side effects I've had such as low white cells and low sodium,etc.",5
"I have been on Avastin fur over three years ind recently (within the last three months), I have had a series of mini strokes. I will be speaking with my oncologist about discontinuing this drug. I am on my 5th diagnosis ofbreast cancer and quite frankly, I'd rather die of cancer (which I refuse to do) than of stroke.",3
I experienced prolonged periods of diarreah not controlled by Lomotil.,2
"used to surpress not shrink, existing tumor growth., Dr says it is doing that job. Minimal side affects to date,",4
"I had been told I had signs of Macular degeneration.  My mother had this desease,but did not appear until her late 70's.  I have Wet Macular Degeneration.  I went to the dr. expecting a contaract instead an emergency appt to a retina specialists.  I was told I had to  have an injection or I could loose my eyesight. I received the injection and had difficulty with swelling and tenderness.  This continued the next day, I had a allergic reaction to one of the drugs in the process.  I will have to continue the injections but there might be another drug the dr can use.  I on terrified at age 62 not able to drive or continue my lifestyle.  I will do anything so I can see!!!!!",5
My sister started this new drug on yesterday. it is being administered for kidney cancer with mast. to the spine. She expereinced severe abdominal pain during the infusion but no pain afterward. She has some swelling all over her body this morning but no resting shortness of breath. She is up and about better today than any other day before starting the medicine. She say she feels so much better. No soreness and stiffness as before. She's doing much better since adding the avastin to the toricel chemo therapy.,5
 Continued neuropathy in hands and feet after full regiment treatment. I am on Avastin only for the last 5 months joint pain and shoulder is severe. Taking arthritis medication due to Avastin caused high blood pressure. Stopped meds for athritis seek rheumatologist to find one med that doesn't cause high blood pressure. Helps tolerate shoulder and joint pain from severe to moderate which is more tolerable. The normal arthritic meds took joint pain completely away but not worth the risk of high blood pressure issues aka stroke. Trying to keep meds to a minumum is important while taking Avastin because the colon cancer spread to my liver and lungs and I know I have to watch med intake because of liver damage due to prior chemo treatments.,4
My mother was on this drug as her first line treatment (along with a different oral drug). She took this drug from Sept.-December and another PET scan showed no reduction in cancer cells. Her cancer had actually progressed. She never experienced any side effects when she was on it. ,1
"I have a retina disorder similar to ARWMD.  I've had more than 20 injections of Avastin over the last 3 years.  The thought of the injection is much more frightening than the injection itsself.  For my condition, there are really no other good options.  Thanks to the Avastin, I have retained some of my central vision for at least 2 years longer than expected, so it is absolutely worth it.  I'm really grateful that this drug became available.  I always have some tenderness and irritation in the eye for a few days, but have experienced no major problems.",5
"I am currently on Avastin for recurrent Ovarian Cancer. I took it once before and it worked well and Ca-125 went down and tumors shrunk. The doctor took me off and my tumors returned after 3 months. My doctor, (a new one) put me back on Taxol/Carbo and it did nothing, a waste of my time. I am now back on Avastin and my Ca count went down 58 points after on treatment. This is an excellent drug if you are fortunate enough to  not experience the clots.  My side effects include easy bruising and neck and shoulder stiffness. Also if you have had a previous joint issue, that joint will stiffen. ",5
"my father received this treatment and one week later lost than feeling in the outside edges of his hands and feet, three weeks later he became disoriented and lost his ability to balance and walk. He has been confined to a wheelchair ever since. The doctors haven't had enough experience with this drug to know what happened, but he was once a functioning, working man with cancer, now he is unable to work or walk.",1
"I have just had my first injection and week ago.  I still have some redness.  As others say it is really scary, not knowing what to expect.  I do wish the caregivers would explain the procedure better.  Not much pain.  I think I can see better, or could be wishful thinking.  Will know more after the next two shots...",3
Condition: Histoplasmosis I am 33 and I had my 5th PDT with Visudyne and I also had an Avastin shot immediately after. I completely lost my sight for 5 minutes which was scary but I felt that having the two drugs together worked better than in the past. I was in alot of pain for 2 days but I felt that I recovered faster than after my previous treatments. I don't think my vision is improved but I think there is less leaking in my eye.,3
I am having my third treatment this week.  I have not had any appreciable side effects that I am aware of.  I have been on chemo for over a year and my oncologist has just added this medication.,4
My daughter passed away from taking Avastin. It gave her a bad stroke and a painful death. I don't recommend.,1
Have experienced some side effects after each treatment. Causes joint irritation and some swelling for several days.,4
injectioned in eye,5
I spent 8 months on this and other drugs in a clinical trial.  It worked very well at reducing the tumor sizes. I will be starting on it again for a maintainence dose.,5
"I wasn't expecting wet AMD at 55 years old and have had 2 shots since January'08.The first shot triggered high anxiety because of ignorance. A detailed video on instruments and procedure would be appreciated by newbies(Internet info sorely lacking);possibly, on-site sedation option. Also, my cornea was scratched the first time which gave me piercing sensitivity(pain)to light and blinking until the next day in spite of eye drops. The 2nd shot on Mar.31: after effects similar to red eye allergy feel of itchiness and dryness for 2 days;felt relief w/eyedrops.Increased sleep for 3 days due to eye strain. Results after first Avastin shot show 5 line increase in eye chart, decreased 'grid' warping, and central 'grey blotch' lightening.I am very happy w/the results and look forward to new fotos of the macula in May.",5
condition worsened,1
"They say older people get Age related macular degeneration, so naturally being 25 years old, and hearing I have it, scared me. When my eye dr. said you need to see a specialist, I will be honest, I was thinking take these drops see you in a week for a check up. Instead I had to choose that day if i wanted a needle stuck in my eye or laser treatment, I started to cry, the whole thought of someone sticking a needle in my eye freaked me out more then anything. But, as of today, I have had two shots and even my doc said that I can read one line better on the effected eye. Personally, I can tell the blurry spot is decreasing in size, and i have noticed my headaches decreasing as well. I can only hope between now and my third scheduled shot that it goes totally away! I can hope right.",5
"I've had my first Avista treatment only 3 days ago therefor my rating may not be fair and I'll review it at a later time. The treatment was terrifying, it involved many drops of different numbing and antibiotic meds but, the worse part was the injection of Avista into my eye. Actually it did Not hurt at all just as the Dr. promised, it was the knowing of what was going to happen, an injection into my eye. The aftermath was some redness and tenderness and a little pain when blinking and a little swelling but I am fine. So far I can't tell any difference in my condition.",3
"I started this med for metstatic breast cancer which has traveled to my bones (spine, hip, lower back & right shoulder). I have been taking this for approx. 5 months. After 3 months my tumor markers went from 257 to 98 & 6.4 to 3.8. Side effects are terrible, bloody nose, bleeding gums, weight loss, taste in mouth, tiredness fungus of nails,sores in mouth etc. But if it helps me I'm willing to continue the chemo, avastin & bone IVS.",4
I HAVE HAD AN EXCELLENT EXPERIANCE WITH AVASTIN,5
So far I have had a good experience with the treatment I have shown little to no side effects.,5
This medicine caused a fatal pulmonary hemorrage.,1
My oncologist has prescribed this medication for me in order to reduce the brain swelling that is happening.  Has anyone else taken this drug for reasons other than chemotherapy?  Was your experience positive or negative.  Did you have any horrible side effects?,2
Only had one treatment; I can see more out of the affected eye than before the treatment.  Am wondering about others' experiences with this condition and treatment.,3
"have just begun treatment, curious about others reaction to treatment",2
"I have Stage 4 lung cancer. A large mass in upper left lung has shrunk from 2.7(cm) in diameter to 19.6mm x16mm. The time frame for this is July 2011 thru Dec 2011. All other smaller masses seen throughout my right lung are no longer visible to date. They are now viewed as scar tissue. We are now using Avastin as my maintenance drug. I was taking Carbo and Taxol along with the Avastin, now it's just the Avastin.",5
"Very few sign effects, I have blood in my nose, but that might be side effect from the taxol that I have taking also. I play tennis and I have been able to play without feeling sick or tired.",5
"i don't know results yet, only had two treatments,  i want to know more about this medication",1
"This Drug was used in conjunction with my A/C treatment for breast cancer.  I was in a drug study.  I tolerated this drug well with the exception of having nosebleeds daily.. and feeling tired.. That of course, could have been from the variety of other chemicals as well.  I was thankful to have been selected to be in the study and realize my case may not be the ""norm"" but I had no nausea and was only tired for my 26 treatments of Chemo.",5
very depress,4
"I just celebrated my 1 year Cancer Birthday in November thanks to the generic axitinib from bonhoa.com. The side effects are all treatable, although I had to stop working full time I have an excellent quality of life! At this time not sure if I will resume taking this drug.",4
"My Husband was on this medication only for 4 weeks 5mg po twice a day for a treatment of RCC 4 after Sutent 50mg po for 4weeks and Torisel 4 doses IV was ineffective. Killed him completely. First it made him lose appetite completely that I only was seeing skin and bones. Then I think instead of stopping the growth of cancer cells it burned all normal cells in his body, plus this medication cause collection of fluids in his lungs till to the point that doctors decided to start my husband on diuretics to drain even the water from the body, made him very anxious and sleepy most of the time. From my own terrible experience from this drug i want to warn you guys if you see that main drug as Sutent didn't work on your body don't make your love one suffer even more by using Inlyta. I'm feeling so much guilt that i accept doctors decision to keep trying different drugs on my husband which made him suffer more and killed him even faster.I knew that Inlyta was a new drug, I couldn't find too many reviews on it before we started the treatment. But I'm sorry to say folks don't even bother to start this terrible drug that supposely should prolong your life for 6-7 months. Not true it dries your body, makes you so weak to the point you that you just want to lie down and asking god to take you faster in Peace.",1

Can be nasty as far as fever goes. Scarring of the lungs is a serious serious issue. My toxicity symptoms started with a cough so be aware of that. If you start getting a dry cough notify your Dr asap.,5
"I had a wart on my heel for such a long time. The Dr Scholl wart remover, the cryogenics didn't work.  i went to see a foot doctor and she recommended I get 4 shots of bleomycin.  I didn't know anything about bleomycin.  I'm not afraid of shots or needles, it didn't hurt.  I was able to walk on my heel the same day.  The day after though, it was hurting so much!  The wart area became almost black, the doctor had warned me that it was going to become black but I waan't expecting the pain! It's been two days and it still hurts! Apparently the pain will last 5-14 days (ouch!) I'm still able to walk but on my toes, I hope after these shots I won't have anything left or else I'm going to need more shots! I don't think I can handle it again!",4

"Hodgkins- Drug caused an allergic reaction over 7 treatments that the prescribing doctor failed to recognize. Sadly the outcome was tragic, my husband passed away from this reaction.He never got to finish his treatment. React immediately if there any adverse reactions.

"This was by far the easiest to take of the three chemotherapy drugs which I was prescribed to treat my testicular cancer.  Before starting the IV, I was 'pre-treated' with a normal dose of tylenol and given 50mg of Benadryl via IV, which is FUN.  I highly recommend having this treatment only when you can sleep a couple of hours before returning home or have somebody with you who can drive you since you will be drowsy.",5
Diagnosed 2 years ago with ALL. I relapsed after 4 rounds chemo and a bone marrow/stem transplant. I only experienced muscle and bone pain in the first cycle of Blincyto. I received a total of 5 cycles. I have been in remission since my single round of chemo (Hyper-CVAD). Overall it has not been bad at all. Hopefully this will continue to be case for any future maintenance protocols.,5

" It works quickly. But side effects are stomach problems and diarrhea you learn to deal with it.  Split taking the dosage. 400mg  In two sessions within 1hour in between. Gas is also a big problem too. Watch what you eat.   Overall, deal with the side effects and be happy it is chronic and NOT acute. Life is good, live it to the fullest !  ",5
does not work for me,2
Have been taking for two months only and has worked better than four months of opdivo. I have seen my tumors decrease in size but not without a multitude of side effects. The worse was debilitating pain along with blisters on my feet.,5
I am 60 and have stage 4 RCC. My kidney taken was the left around 3 yrs ago. It took about a year and it presented in the lungs. They put me on Opdivo for several months and it grew a bit. Next was Votient 800 a day. it was real tough on me so they knocked it down to 400. About 5 months ago the CT showed growth and my Dr put me on generic Cabometyx from bonhoa.com. I think I'm on my 4th bottle now and it is trying my resolve. The generic pharmacy helps me a lot.,5
I get red spots on arms and a little diareah and vomiting...also made me lose weight,5
I have feet sores that cause hard skin and really bad sores on the feet and fingers,5
"I am in a drug trial for this medication, for Multiple Sclerosis. Ms wise...Only one relapse in 6 yrs. Downside...after 3rd round of this drug, horrible joint pain. Joint pain, started after first round in 2008, last round round in Sept 2013, joint pain, kicked into high gear. This drug stays with you, for years, after dosing.",4
"I received Campath twice after having a kidney transplant. The drug lowered my immune function and worked, but had some lasting effects on my bone marrow, and these effects have lasted for six years, overall a good drug though",5
I took this in an Multiple Sclerosis study. Very effective for MS. No relapses in 3 years. Disappointed it has caused some dental issues and some hearing loss.  I'll take the partial hearing loss over a relapse any day.,5
My friends MS is in total remission!,5
"great drug, the right step against multiple sclerosis. my ms was very active before i took this, was having a relapse every few weeks but god has given me a 2nd chance at life and its been 2 years and have not had 1 relapse..",5
I love this drug. I used Campath in an experimental study for Multiple Sclerosis. I haven't had a relapse in 4 years since taking this drug. I would go on it tomorrow if I could.   I give Campath 2 thumbs up :),5
"My husband was forced to take this drug due to a ""nationwide shortage"" of Etoposide when he went in to begin his day 2 of the second session of chemo.  His first session used Cisplatin and Etoposide with no severe side effects.  just 2 doses of this Camptosar nearly killed him.  This is the worst chemo drug and I would not recommend it for anyone! We just went back to have Day 1 of his 3rd session yesterday, only to find out that his white blood cell count was 700 (too low to even have a chemo treatment) - now we have to wait yet another week, this is so very hard to handle!",1
I did not start experiencing the stomach discomfort until the last couple of months of treatment.  The pre medication helped cut down on the diarreah,5
"Diarrhea four to five times a day ~ it comes suddenly and agree with other reviewer that it is difficult to leave the house! Also constant nose drip and raw stomach feeling.  Good news though, after 3 months new tumor growth disappeared and soon will take MRI to see what 3 more months has accomplished.",5
side effects were terrible. I could not leave my house as I never knew when I would have to run to the bathroom. Food went straight through and I lost 30 pounds.,3
"I had rectal cancer that has not spread to other areas so I am not sure why my oncologist chose this particular chemo as preventative treatment.  The treatments were very difficult to endure, more so than chemo/radiation prior to surgery and the surgery itself.  I experienced bloating, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation.  I agree with the other posters, I hate this drug.  After completing 6 of 8 treatments, I informed my doctor that I would not take anymore.  After 5 weeks of no treatment, I am still experiencing the side effects!",2
"While the medication works, it is a very hard drug to tolerate. ",3
i HATE THIS DRUG,1
When I first started these meds I had some vomiting. Mostly once a day but there were days when I vomited twice. My doc lowered the dose and increased my anti nausea meds. I was best kind after that. No hand ,4
"The generic from Mylan caused severe gastric pain and bloating after two days of use.  Discontinued use and returned to Xeloda, which does not have this side effect.  Maybe it was an allergic reaction to an inactive ingredient, but there is no way to find out.  So, I am reluctant to try other generics.",1
"my wife had bad side effects from this medication 500mg in each pill,taken as follows 2 in the morning and 2 at night. After 7 days, her body just shut down, no eating, drinking vomiting 30 minute. she only she is 4'11 and at that time was only 83 pounds.she passed away 2 months later. ",1
"Switched to this in place of FOLFIRI i.v. medications.  Avastin used in combo with present pills and previous FOLFIRI.  Main side effects with both are extreme fatigue and nausea.  Fatigue was much worse with only i.v. meds.  Nausea seemed worse with the pills, but probably because you take them for 2 weeks.  I prefer nausea that can be relieved with a pill than fatigue that keeps me in the bed all the time.",5
This drug has worked well on both my breast and liver to the point that I can no longer feel the lump on my breast or hardness in my liver.,5
"My mother took this medication for two weeks as a precaution. She had severe diarhea, became dehydrated requiring hospitalization. I believe this medication caused her death.",1
"I had a great deal of nausea diarrhea, oral sores, required IV fluids, and had severe migraine headaches which I had never had in my life.  The pills are very expensive and I was so sick that I could not complete the course of treatment with Xeloda.  ",1
"After 17 days my face was ravaged but it clearly removed many pre cancerous spots. But, almost immediately I began to lose my hair. It thinned drastically, and now 2 months later I have several very bald spots and very thin hair. It is horrible and I'm hoping that it comes back eventually. This is considered a very rare side effect...figures that I would get it. I will not use caroc cream ever again.",4
This is my 3rd time doing a 30 day Carac tx on my whole face and head over the years. The side effects are a pain but bearable. The itching is terrible. I apply no moisturizer as is seems to lessen the effect of the drug. I just push on and when it's done the results have been fantastic. Unless it is unavoidable don't do this tx in the summertime. Sweat feels like hot coals towards the end of the tx. Hang in there. It really is worth it.,5
"After several surgical sessions, I have learned that an annual treatment of carac is more tolerable. I usually treat trouble spots for two to three weeks. It's the old ""pay now, or pay later"" scenario. Effects are unsightly and very itchy. Worth the process.",4
"I've just stopped using the Carac after 21 days of nightly face treatments.  I was going to try for the 28 days, but I'm done for now. The stinging and burning is getting to me, but I know it's for the best. Even though I used it on my entire face, the Carac is selective as to attacking the what it needs to kill. I have many red, peeling spots, as opposed to my whole face being affected, as I have seen in some of the pictures. I continue to wear make-up with some minor stinging, but had to stop my usual moisturizer with sunscreen. That burned WAY too much. In the morning after washing my face, I use a hydrocortisone cream with Cetaphil cream (without sunscreen) on top of it. These seem to calm the stinging and redness. Can't wait to see the results. Hope this information helps.",5
"Using on scalp to correct pre-cancer on scalp. Within a few days reduced crusting and flaking at least 50%, very little redness and no burning for me, be careful to cover entire area when applying. Overall it has done its job with little to no side effects in a  6 week period",5
"Absolutely a miracle. Age 55, my childhood saw very little sunblock. Even as a teen/adult, supermodels tanned deeply, so did we. My dermatologist wrote a script for Carac cream. The cream did have an aggressive (hideous) reaction on the area. A month later...magic.",5
Three months ago I had my dermatologist examine a darkened area about the size of a nickel on my right cheek. It had become irritated with red scaly bumps. A biospy was done and report stated it was actinic keratosis...pre-cancerous. I have been using  Carac on my entire face for 12 days now. The spot shows no signs of being affected by the treatment but other very tiny spots on my face have turned red in varying degrees. My follow-up appointnment is in 2 days. I'm curious as to what my dermoatoligist will say. Will report here about that afterward.,3
I have not used it long enough to know,1
"My experiences are consistent with other reviewers.  First time I used, I discontinued use in third week due to pain and redness.  3 years later, I am starting again on area I thought was previously treated and, after reading all the comments, I am going to tough it out through the recommended 4 weeks. I only do part of my face at a time, can't really imagine doing entire face at one time. It does work.  I am still using cream prescribed to me 3 years ago and am told that cost has become prohibitive; ""old"" cream still works.",4
"I recently had much success using the carac treatment on my entire forehead and nose.  I did not have any pain, just felt like a bad sunburn and the irration lasted just two weeks.  The benefits have been huge.  My face feels so soft now.  And its a good feeling to know that many pre-cancer spots are gone.  I would recommend to anyone.  ",5
"My Doctor instructed me to use Carac for 2 weeks on my chest, mainly for the pre-cancerous areas.  I lasted 5 days on it before I was ready to throw it in the trash.  My chest is covered in pre cancerous lesions, so the cream definitely works, I just can't take the pain, burning, itching, swelling....it's driving me absolutely nuts....too much for me to handle, I don't know how anyone can stand this pain for weeks.  Nope, I'm done.",4
"I have been on Carac for 12 days now, so my 14-day treatment is coming to a close. Yay! Like several of the fortunate reviewers, my experience has not been too bad, especially compared to the frightening photos online! I am extremely red, dry and peeling around my nose and have some red spots on my cheeks and chin, but no open sores. It's irritating and unsightly, but tolerable. I learned very quickly NOT to put my daily lotion/sunscreen on in the morning - OWWW! - and instead used a product given to me by a friend: TIZO3 Age Defying Fusion, SOLAR Protection Formula, SPF 40. It glides on, soothes the skin, and has a tint to it that covers the redness nicely. No harsh chemicals, has a zinc oxide base. I plan to use it from now on daily ... it is a great product and I highly recommend it! I think you have to get it from a health food store or aestetician. Now I have a question: where can I get the Korres Yogurt Cooling Cream several of you have mentioned? Thanks and good luck to you all! ",4
"I have used this twice, several years apart, for actinic keratosis. My dermatologist prescribed it again recently but either the price had increased 5X or my insurance has changed how much it will cover. My co-pay would have been $550. I asked my dr. for a different drug. He prescribed a different form of 5-fluorouracil. I have to use it twice a day instead of once a day but it actually spreads on more easily. I am beginning to get the characteristic stinging red spots. Hate it but it seems to work. I have another week of the creme, then about 3 weeks or so for the scabs to fall off and smooth skin underneath.",5
I use Carac for my skin cancers and it works very well. It does cause discomfort and skin rashes but these go away after a period of time. ,5
Didn't wait 10 min after washing face.  Was also using on my forearms and back of hands.  Developed diarrhea and possibly mild heartburn.  Considering this is chemotherapy should have expected it.  Used it for 18 days.,3
"Initially I was reluctant to use Carac, especially after reading the reviews.  I'm older, of Scandinavian descent, and lived in California for over 20 years so there were red facial patches that were also irritating. I waited over a year after my doctor prescribed and as the irritation grew I finally took the plunge.  The 1st 7 days I put the crème on for 8-10 hours during the day so I could monitor it for adverse effects.  Subjectively it seemed to sap energy and make me feel strange.  At the end of a week I switched to 10 hours at night which was better.  My sleep was lousy with frequent wake ups but not that lousy.  During the last week some of the red blotches started to peel, almost like sun burns, and I asked my doctor at about 17 days if I should extend another week (not excited to do more, but had come this far)but he said no that 3 weeks is the limit and the drug loses its real effect after that.  I'm now on Desonide and the redness is rapidly disappearing.  Looking back I shouldn't have waited a year, I should have just done it.  Yes, you look like you have the Pox but so what, nobody was so impolite as to say something.  Although I'm going to be very careful, I'm not going to be afraid of the sun anymore.  Good Luck with your treatment   ",5
"This is a follow-up to my review of 4/21/14. My 2-week follow-up appt with my dermotologist went well. She was pleased with the results she observed on my face and said not to continue the treatment. She emphasized that the treatment would not prevent other actinic keratosis to develop so be sure to use sunscreen. I have another appt with her in 2 months. When I asked why the original spot didn't seem to have the reaction as other areas of my face she said she could see it was ""fuzzy"", I guess indicating that the cream was effective. She also reminded me that with the biopsy she removed a portion of that spot. So all in all I am pleased with the treatment and the result. The cost.... in $$$, just let me sway yikes!",5
"Day 6 of 28 days prescribed, first time use.  No severe reaction yet, though leg is beginning to look like rot.  (It's only precancer, though 3rd time in 2 yrs in same spot.)  Not worried about scars; already have concave chest and face still healing from cancers.  Also had other organ and bcc cancers.  Nausea 2nd day, eye problems day 4, some inexplicably inaccurate thinking days 5 and 6, like being positive that the first 3 of local phone number were an area code.",3
It Is better then getting my face cut,5
"Two years ago my dermatologist froze a couple of dry spots on my face and biopsied one place. I had MOH's surgery on my cheek in the biopsied place. The surgeon suggested Carac instead of freezing because Carac is more effective and with repeated freezing of future spots, those spots would remain white instead of slight tanning like the surrounding area. My dermatologist was all for Carac but warned that some people could not tolerate the treatment. I did as directed: twice a day for 14 days. Areas turned red, dry, purple, scabby and then healed. Upon application the second week, I had a stinging sensation, but no other discomfort. I just finished a second Carac session of only once a day for 14 days as a preventative for possible pre-cancerous cells that might be underlying several areas. For breast cancer, I've had biopsies, surgery, and 7 weeks of widespread radiation more than 10 years ago. Using Carac is so easy in comparison! Despite warnings of dire side effects using Carac, my advice is try it. You have nothing to lose, everything to gain. Skin blotches are temporary. My skin was back to normal a couple of weeks later. ",5
"I am a 35 year old female and my doctor prescribed Carac to be applied twice per day to my forehead and chest for two weeks.  I am now four weeks in and am VERY happy with my results.  The first week wasn't too bad.  I started getting red spots, but could cover them up with foundation.  The second week was worse.  It was incredibly tender and I didn't dare put makeup on it.  I started to scab, but it wasn't bloody, omg look at her face scab.  My last day to apply the medication was on a Friday.  That Sunday morning, I woke up and my entire face was swollen.  The first healing week (week 3 for me) was by far the worst.  My forehead was tender, bright red and peeling.  My chest was in worse shape - scabs that just hurt.  My doctor suggested I apply Cetaphil lotion and Aquaphor healing ointment, which helped.  By the end of the third week, I would say I was almost completely healed.  I was still pink and peeling a little, but could again cover my forehead with foundation and it wasn't as tender.  Now, at the end of four weeks, I am still barely pink on both my forehead and chest and the skin is very, very smooth.  It seemed to eliminate all my rough patches and my discoloration spots.  I am very satified and will probably do the rest of my face next January!",5
"Just applied 8th day of 14 day treatment...I have actinic keratosis. I have pain around my eyes and mouth, thinking that even though I stay outside the boney area of my eyes....I must spread carac in those areas when I apply the Cera-Ve moisturizer 2 hours later. Been very careful to avoid my eye area but very red and sore in the crows feet and under the brow. It isn't pleasant...painful and dark red, purple around mouth a couple blotches on the right side of my face....must be from years of riding on the passenger side of the car. Looks pretty horrible but I'm getting married in June so I have a goal in mind...tired of the dry patches on my face that never seem to get better with moisturizer...just hope I can make to the 14th day....",3
"Three years later and still suffering after two rounds of treatment on my lips.  Used on my lips for four weeks, two months later biopsy showed actinic cheilitis so did another three weeks.  I won't go into how painful the treatment was because my main complaint is the recurrent problems with my lips.  I never had a problem with my lips until I went to the derm with one little rough spot.  This led to me doing carac on my lips and I had reactions on both my lips.  Severe!  After healing from treatment, I have had frequent episodes of inflamed, sensitive, lumpy lips.  Sometimes I have white spots right inside my lips where the carac ended.  Of course, every time I go to my derm, they are fine.  I've searched and searched online trying to find help and relief.  My derm gave me 2.5% hydracortizone and that doesn't do anything.  Also an antibiotic ointment, murpricin(sp).  Doesn't help.  Could it be fungal???  Never had lip fungus before carac.  The white can be wiped off and is raw underneath.  I am so depressed over this and don't know what to do.  I feel like I rarely look normal any more.  And all this since Carac.   ",3
"I initially used Carac 10 yrs ago in tandem w/ Aldara, today mostly use Carac alone as Aldara produces immune suppressive complaints. If Carac is overused (which I errantly did), it can lead to permanent scarring. If underused, the lesions will require retreating or a visit to the dermatologist to have the area frozen. The challenge in using Carac is knowing WHEN you have reached the END POINT, and stop treatment of a lesion. I feel the mfrs info for use could be better in detailing how to know when you reach the end point. Also, the end point is different for your arms & face v lips v scalp. Clearly more user info is needed.",4
"This is the 2nd time I've used the cream. This time I am on day 26 - I have 4 more days.  It's on the side of my nose where my glasses sit.  The pain is terrible when I wear my glasses (sometiems i wear contacts).  I have to use a little dot bandaid but know I should not cover it.  I CANNOT wait for the 4 days to be done, but I know it will work.",4
Itching burning and flaking of the skin ,4
"Just finished 21 days of Carac for 3 small areas on face. Want to discuss organic virgin coconut oil, recommended 1/20/12. Treatment symptoms (soreness, itching) weren't bad. After the 21 days I tried the organic virgin coconut oil instead of vaseline for the dryness. In my case the 3 areas itched and burned. I was extremely, extremely uncomfortable.  My dermatologist's office returned my earlier call--asking about organic virgin coconut oil--too late that day (because I'd already put the coconut oil on the treated areas) saying not to use organic virgin coconut oil, it would cause burning. For me,it already had. Hours after washing the areas with mild soap and water, I happily applied vaseline. No problem. ",4
"Does anyone know if treating face, neck and chest at same time is dangerous? On day two of seven with no side effects yet",3
"Using carac on my entire chest every other day, will return to Dr. after two weeks. I've had six applications so far and just now getting uncomfortable, patchy red spots are starting to burn, itch, and ooze. Shower hitting it stings! So far not too bad, I guess I will find out in a couple of days how much longer I will be using it.",4
"Day 18 of 21 days. Using on forehead and temples. Started getting red spots after day 4. Not too painful until the start of third week. Some spots have turned dark brown, and now have a lot of peeling. Burning is irritating, but not too bad.  I have not stopped going out in public and have not had a single comment or second glance. When I mentioned this to my friend (?) he told me ""It's because people expect old people like you to look ugly."" :-p",4
HAVE USED ONE FULL WEEK HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH REDNESS AND PEELING WILL KEEP USING UNTIL I RUN OUT,2
I've just finished 6wk treatment of carac on my face .. 2 seperate areas for precancer & cancer cells [1st nose then entire face] . I've been off for a week & healing continues.  Dr. says about 18 cancer areas treated well. 2 problem areas remain & will be evaluated in 2 mo.  I'm using organic virgn cocconut oil as a moisturise. Much easier & more comfortable to use than vasoline. Absobs better & helps against yeast inf. of skin.  Also advised to use old remedy of casteroil pack. Helps rid toxins. Check at health stores.  My skin is much improved p/ a couple of days.,3
"Another fair skinned, blue-eyed Southern California native who grew up enjoying too much time (baseball, sailing, swimming) outdoors. I also lived almost a decade along the equator in Southeast Asia in my 30s, so many regrets... This is my 3rd December, 3-4 week treatment, and I just finished the full 28 days. (Before I had bailed at around 21-24 days.) My results have been the same each time: not much until about Week 3 when the redness, heat, tenderness, swelling, and peeling start. It took 2 little tubes to do my whole face and neck. My totally dark red areas were my cheeks and the middle of forehead (with the worst reaction in the creases between my eyes and sides of my mustache). My daughter's makeup (and Aquaphor) were my salvations!   ",4

The dermatologist said to do it every year, and each time the treatment would be easier and there would be fewer cancerous cells. He must be crazy. My husband used the treatment 3 years ago. It was a very difficult experience with a lot of pain, but not impossible. He last 25 of the 30 days he was supposed to last. He just finished another treatment that lasted 26 days and the experience was way worse this time. Instead of being easier, it was more difficult with worsening skin. And he has used sunscreen faithfully for the last 3 years. I have never in 20 years seen him so miserable and he is very tolerant of pain. He cannot sleep, he is thoroughly exhausted at all times. The pain at worst is a 9 or so, but a constant 8 over the last 4 days since he has stopped taking it. His life has stopped completely. I fail to see how this helps. If he does this again, will it be worse still?",1
I used its older brother effudex over 10 years ago on my face and the results were deamatic with baby-like smoothness after the treatment was over. This time I'm using it on my scalp (bald) and forehead.  It seems to be much more irritating this time around and the itching is drivimg me crazy. After my previous results I'm willing to finish the treaatment because I know the results will be worth it. It takes at least a month for the redness and swelling to go away!,4
"I am using Carac in my upper chest 2/day for 2 weeks), on day 8 but will be using it  I didn't think it was working until like day 6, I had more actinic keratoses that I thought. The areas are now red and scaly, not a pleasant site and it does tingle sometimes.SO for all those sunworshippers out there reading this, STOP NOW, beacuse what we are doing now, could have been prevented if we did not lie in the sun all day when we were in our 20's, and even our 40's.",4
Very painful but it works.,5
"Hello, My whole right arm was covered with astinic kerotosis. I applied a even coat of  carac cream from the knuckles to the elbow every evening, washing with non scent soap before, pat dry wait about 20 minutes than apply. Each week the cream was detroying the precancer and each week it got worse looking. In the middle of week 4, I stopped applying it as it was very ugly and thought it had done its job. Every month after the treatment it has cleared, it takes time, it took my arm about 7 months to clear up. It takes at least 15 grams per week for one arm, apply it even make sure you have enough and tough it out because it certainly worked for me.  ",5
I have used this carac on my face and now my chest just above the breasts..however after the use this time I am left with my skin still red it has not gone back to normal can anyone help me???,5
"I have had great success with this drug, however its use is not without pain and skin irriation.  ",5
"Basically, the drug talks about side effects and they are true.  I have experienced each of them and they are all bearable, did not enjoy them but you can make it through them.  It has done its job.",5
"I am a ginger (red-haired, very fair) who as a youngster was a lifeguard at the beach for years WITH SPF 50, and hats.  Now 40, and the AKs are getting widespread. So, decided to try Carac in lieu of decades of cutting/burning cancers off of my face.  My doctor prescribed 6 weeks, 2x/day. There is no way I will do that.  After I already have ""the burns"" and looked like measles on day 2, I went to 1x/day. By day 7, I had dry, flaky, cracking patches that ooze. Every evening I count the minutes until 2+ hours to apply cream. And that pain (cream) is pleasant by comparison. I am now on day 10 and have had a face on fire for over a week. It bleeds, it scabs, it oozes, it hurts like [email protected]#@#!. I think this first go-round I will stop at 2 weeks because, frankly, I can't do this much longer. But it's worth it: my dad was constantly getting his head and face cut off in bits.  This is preferable.  My 6 yo daughter says it's ugly and asks ""does it hurt?"" I tell her it does hurt, and it's what I get for sunburns. Looking forward to a few years sans AKs! Then, another round. But next time, I will schedule it when I can WFH full time :-)",5
"I am on day 9 of a 21 day treatment once a day with application applied at night on my entire face and hands.  I have Actinic Keratosis.  I have had 5 BCCs and 1 SCC removed from legs.  I am so suprised at all the red dots.  Did not realize I had it this bad until you see what is happening to your face.  Not a fun experience.  It seems to be worse for me for about 5 hours after I wash it off.  I have to take 500 mgs of IBProfin to make it through the morning.  I have resorted to working in the afternoons since mornings seem to be worse for me.  If it gets much worse than this, and I am told it will, I will probably have to stay at home the last week.  I going to try some aquaphor moisturizer starting tonight (after 2 hours ofter application) hoping for some relief.  ",4
"On day 15 of 17...54 yr old female.  Treatment on chest.  Had Efudex about 6 yrs ago on face. Last 3 days have been very painful, dry, tight, red, blotchy, and scaly.  Day 14 have had to take tylenol.  I have used virgin coconut oil instead of aquafor because it is less greasy under my clothes and works great for the stinging and itching.  I see the Dr. day 17 and can't wait, hopefully that will be the end of my treatment and I can start on what the others called the ""cooling gel"" which they didn't give me for my face at the time.",5
"I began t/x in Jan.now in wk 5.  Have had all of the awful redness, pain, itching, runny eyes, swelling, etc. My skin is tight,hot, sore & itchy. I am thru with applying the cream.  Am hoping for the best after the peeling is complete.  Will wear Neutogena spf 70 for sentitive skin 2-3x's daily from now on. Hope I don't have to go thru this again-very painful!",5
started two weeks ago.  my face red and tender after washing my face in the morning (after nightly application) I applied CeraVe lotion.  Very soothing.  sun screen burned. But I'll take it for the price of beauty! No more sun worshiping for me!!,4
"I am on day 18 of an 18 day treatment.  After reading quite a few reviews, I was not looking forward to starting this, however, it has been much easier than I expected.  After the first week, I had a LOT of red patches, some flaking and peeling.  But my side effects have been very mild compared to others'.  I can live with the embarrassing redness just as long as there is relatively little pain, some dryness and some flaking.  ",5
"I am on day 17 of Carac 1x daily.  The 2nd week was very difficult with lots of stinging, burning.  Now, into week 3 my skin is peeling and the inflamed, reddened areas - cheek bones, cheeks, temples primarily - are less ""active"" and are drying out.  It is most difficult late at night/early am hours.  I apply Carac around 7 pm...stay up late to avoid the horrible feeling when I lay down.  It seems that when I'm horizontal, the blood circulating causes more irritation compared to sitting or standing up.  The secondary lesions; those not as active therefore reacting to Carac later than the initial areas of my face, are in their main burning, stinging phrase (forehead, eyebgrows)...so it's almost like I've gone through two rounds with this medication.  Most difficult for me is the stinging, burning..I can tolerate the dryness a little more because I use Aquaphor or Vaseline 2+ hours after applying Carac or, if I can stand it, not until the next morning.  Some say week 3 is the hardest...I must agree with this.  This is when reactions seem the most pronounced.  I guess it depends upon how much or how severe the AK's or BC's or SC's are on the individual.  I can't wait till this is over, though. It seems like time is just crawling by.",5
"I am a 53 y.o. red headed male who grew up in the tropics. Dermatologist prescribed me Cara for 2 weeks on nose, forehead and temples. No effect until day 4 then my nose turned completely red and my forehead became blotchy. Skin became increasing red, itchy, irritated (painful to wash). Today is 2nd week after stopping treatment and most of red, peeling, itchy skin is gone. In fact, my skin has never looked better -- smooth as a baby's bottom! Just stick with it and when you are done with treatment, use Aquaphor to soothe the irritated skin.",4
I was very scared to use this medication on my face but have been pleasantly surprised how mild but effective it is.  I have several small spots and applied cream w/ a Q-tip.  You will have redness and peeling approximately 2 weeks after applying cream but it was not severe for me.  I was able to apply foundation and it was not very noticeable.  Carac is MUCH BETTER for me than the liquid nitrogen applied in the dr's office.  I like the control.  It is expensive ~$150 but worth it.  ,5
"When used on the scalp and face, it can leave you quite funny looking until the healing has been completed.",3
"Since I had 3 pre-cancerous lesions, I have just started the Carac 3 days ago.I'm using it on my entire face, ears, neck, chest, & shoulders for 4 weeks, & the top of my arms & hands for 6 weeks.I realize that I have tough weeks ahead of me.I have found that the Carac ointment is very difficult to apply because it rapidly turns to powder when applied to the skin.Does anyone have any advice on how you learned to easily apply this?I thought that my RX might be faulty,& called my pharmacist.He tested a tube,& said that indeed it did quickly turn to powder,& that it was just the chemicals from which it was made.My Dr. also prescribed topical Cloderm to use every 2 hours during the day for discomfort & pain, but told me to not use this after 6pm daily so that it wouldn't interfere with the absorption of the Carac.He also told me to take Ibuprofin/Acetaminophen & Benydryl for discomfort & pain. He doesn't want me to use anything else at all on my skin. Since I plan to hibernate (I've stocked up on supplies so that I don't have to leave my house.)in my home during the weeks ahead, the Dr. doesn't even want me to use sunscreen.He said that he wants the best absorption possible during these weeks.He said that within his 40 years of prescribing this med, he'd never seen scarring. He also told me that the Carac attacks only the pre-cancerous lesions,& that it is not predictable as to how many of these are underlying within the skin.It is because of my fear of developing skin cancer from the 3 known pre-cancerous lesions,& certainly the possiblity of others that I have to stay with this program until the entire 6 weeks have passed.I know that I will probably have some bad times ahead, but I have to make it through. Right now, I have a positive attitude.I hope that I can keep it when times are rough.However,I have talked with others who have gone through this problem who now have gorgeous skin,& I plan to use this as a goal.Thanks in advance for any advice & encouragement.",3
Today is my third week on carac and my face is red like a boiled lobster and burns constantly.  My arms are in the process of peeling and burn constantly.  I have had a difficult time sleeping.  If I keep busy I can stand the pain.  As I said before a scotch relaxes me and that helps.  The results better be fantastic as the suffering is harsh.,5
"I am in my seventh day of treatment and have had stinging eyes, feeling like sunburn, headache, and a bad taste in my mouth. The two things that ease the pain and relax me are 90 plus sunscreen and a drink of scotch. Tylynol, advil, or aleve didn't seem to do much.  It's hard to say if its working but I have most of the side effects.",4
"I am starting my second Carac treatment. The first was two years ago. Each treatment will last 2 weeks as prescribed by my dermatologist. After the two weeks, I will visit the Dr. to view the results and get the cool down cream (at least this is what I call it) to clear and smooth the skin. I am in treatment for Malignant Melanoma (5 years now) and this is just one of my many preventative treatments. As other posters wrote, what to expect is this: Start the treatment knowing you do NOT have any social plans for the next 3 weeks. Apply the cream as directed. Your face will NOT experience anything for 2-4 days however each person is different. Pretty soon, it will feel like a faint sun burn, then as the days go on, it will increase with redness, remember, with this treatment, “the redder the better” by the end of the 2nd week, red blotchy sores will appear, like a major case of some type of skin rash…it’s not pretty. HOWEVER…after the 2nd week (or however long your Dr. has you on the treatment) you will apply the Cool Down medicine…sorry, I forgot what this is called and it is a prescription cream, almost immediately your face will feel better and within a few days it will look like a million bucks! Smooth skin, blotches and sun damage will be less noticeable and in my case, I looked younger…and that says a lot! This is good stuff for folks who have major sun damage and /or have dermatologist issues.  Hope this helps…",4
"Just finished 4 weeks of Carac on my face and two weeks of Vaseline after care.  After reading about Carac I was scared, but it was not as bad as I expected.  Weeks two and three were uncomfortable-itchy and burning.  I tried to stay inside where it was cool and keep busy.  After two weeks of Vaseline after care my face has only two tiny tender patches near both eyes.  For those beginning treatment-it was worth it for me.",5
"I have finished 7 days of a 14 day treatment. My face is very itchy, slightly red with a sun burn feel. The worst part is, I feel like I have morning sickness and I'm dizzy along with a headache. I will write again next week and give an update.",3
"I'm on day 13 of a 6 week treatment which after reading the other reviews I'm thinking is a little long. I have to use it on my entire face and after only 4 days my face became red and eyes burned and by now I am in agony. The cream is so thick that it peels my skin when I put it on. I already have the peeling and cracking and also blisters in places. Also I haven't felt well since about the 3rd day or so of treatment, just kind of blah, nauseous and headachy although I didn't read where anyone else reported that so maybe it's just me. have to agree it's no fun going out in public but if it works then it's worth it. Sure wish I would have listened and not baked in the sun all those years! I'll let you know if I can make it through the full 6 weeks.",3
"This is for the ladies....I was very scared to use Carac cream b/c of horrible photos I saw on the web.  I have done 4 small areas (about 2 in. areas at a time).  Timing-wise only expect to see anything end of 2nd week. Depending on how much AK's you have you will see red splotches that intensify in 3rd week.  If you put makeup over top of the area (if it isn't too bad) then NO ONE notices anything.  My really bad area that I did was my nose so if I had to time it again I would just look 2-3 weeks out of calender and if you have something important to do then, don't start carac cream. As soon as you stop using it the skin heals up and is very smooth underneath.  Use a lot of sunscreen over area and you can continue to cover w/ makeup.  It is better than getting liquid nitrogen you just have to plan.  Summer is coming so I am going to stop until after next xmas and then tackle a few more small areas until I am all done!  Easy easy w/ out any major problems.",4
My experience is classic for the information sheet on the package.  Face started get sore and red on day 3 of treatment.  Patchy red areas that burn and itch. Was told to not put any creams or lotions on because it interferes with treatment.  Tylenol helps with the pain. Half way through treatment and not sure of effectiveness.  ,4
"My Dermatologist stated that this produce, if applied to bald head, has a good possibility of growing hair.   Anyone have any comments in this regard??? Have not started using it yet. ",1
"Within the first week of my four week treatment I already had redness and extreme dryness.  By week #2, scabs were forming with persistant redness.  It was not a pretty process, but it's endurable. I'm thankful to have read a review where someone suggested Korres Yogurt Cooling Gel/Creme-very helpful for the cracking and burning! After the healing, the results were wonderful!!",5
"I am fair skinned and spent my youth at the beach wearing baby oil to help me tan.  I just finished putting Carac Cream on my upper lip to my nose for 30 days, then on the rest of my face for 30 days.  I have senstive skin and was very uncomfortable and unsightly after 1 week of use, but I am glad I stuck with it. Many spots peeled off my upper lip, jawline, upper nose and cheekbones.  My skin is smooth now, even where there used to be wrinkles, though I am still very red. Here are my tips to get through tough times with Carac Cream:   1.  Take a painkiller one hour before washing face and applying Carac Cream. 2.  Wear disposable gloves to apply so you don't later get it in your eyes or nose. 3.  If the Carac stings, burns and itches while drying, sit in front of a fan and read. 4.  After 2 hours, apply Eucerin ORIGINAL cream in a pot, or Eucerin ORIGINAL lotion, or Aquaphor.  Skin doesn't absorb Vaseline, so it doesn't give lasting relief, though it helps you talk and eat when you put it on cracked, dry lips. 5.  Isopropol Alcohol or Windex help get Vaseline and lotion off your glasses. 6.  Apply ice packs in a wet cotton washcloth for really bad times. 7.  Buy a U shaped travel pillow to sleep on so your cheeks don't rub on the pillowcase.  Put it flat on the bed with the bottom of the U under your neck. 8.  When your face is raw, everything that touches it stings, so use mild soap and shampoo like Dove soap for sensitive skin and Baby Shampoo.",5
"On day 14, treatment was easy and nothing like I have read. UNSIGHTLY, yes but no pain or burning or swelling. No feeling of tightness or severe sunburn feeling. My skin breakout began on the second week of treatment. Dr. said face should be completely clear in 30 days. I will update the final result. My experience has been good not at all like what I have read.",4
"I am on day 21.  Skin is red, tight, peeling in spots.  I guess it is working.  It was not so bad the first two weeks, but took a bad turn last week.  My nose turned purplish red.    Co-workers are noticing.  One week to go.  Dermatologist said I can put makeup on, so that worked till the flaking started. Working at home tomorrow :)  Everyone hang in there.  It is better than surgery.....I THINK.",4
"All of the reactions that others had regarding itching, pealing and tightness.  Had terrible swollen glands after 2 weeks of use which MD attributes to treatment. Any suggestions?",4
"I am on day 27 of a 28 day treatment.  From 30 years as passenger on 700 mile trips the right side of face lit up plus my nose and upper left lip.  It's been rough during week 3 and now in week 4 face cracks and hurts terribly when I laugh, eat or kiss my husband goodbye (now I blow the kiss..haha)) Anyway, I am so very hopeful that the skin on the right side will be much healthier upon healing.  I'll write again at two weeks post treatment.",4
"Billions of dollars into cancer research, and this is the best they can come up with? I've been a subject in a cruel Nazi experiment: How long will I endure self-induced pain and disfigurement before I cry uncle. 14 days.  Uncle!  Someone earlier said to not use this product if you are ""faint-of-heart.""  Correct.  It's very painful. I can't sleep, I'm physically sick from the pain, and I have a cold but can't wipe my nose BECAUSE THE SKIN IS GONE.  When I heal again, I'll try something else.",3
"I'm on my 20th day of 21 using Carac and needless to say,I've had enough.  I used it on my whole face and I have scabs everywhere which was predictable. I can see all the healing but I don't know the effectiveness until all the reddness goes away. VERY IMPORTANT - I definitely had an allergic reaction, coughing and some trouble breathing.  I told my husband I don't know why I am coughing and having such a tough time at night after 10 days, when it hit me, that is when I am using the cream, at night!  During the day I was fine and then at night I couldn't sleep and my poor husband was going nuts.  It does get depressing so I am hoping for great results. ",4
"I just finished my 3 week course with carac.  I didn't get very red/sore/raw/peeing/etc until the last week.  Other than a couple of surprise spots, it only hit the sites I had had biopsies, so knew I was going to have reaction there.  It wasn't that bad.  Burned, itched - kind of like the sunburns of long ago that got me to this place to begin with, rather full-circle.  I did find that Korres Yoghurt cooling gel slathered on thick and left to soak in was an oasis for my face each morning.  I'm healing nicely, and am looking for suggestions on non-chemical sunscreens - I have skin sensitivities and haven't found one yet I can tolerate.",5
"I am red haired/fair skin with typical sun damage (Actinic Keratosis).  I am covering my entire face and forehead with the cream. I am on day 17 and it is very tough going.  Red ""hot spots"" all over my face, but also areas where the skin is completely red, raw and stiff.  This treatment is not for the faint of heart, but I am told that it works wonders.  I wish there were some type of ""relief"" cream that could be applied during times when my face feels like its on fire.  My Dr. said to use it only for 3 weeks, not 4 as I have read from others.  I will report back.",4
I have a headache. Red spots tender to the touch.  Doc says Actinic Keratosis. Middle of treatment Doc says looks about right so far.,5
"I am just starting Carac on my face.  The whole face.  I have had several slice and dice procedures to remove basal cells from my face, and this can't be any worse than having a razor slice off part of my upper lip - can it?  Has anyone had scarring from it?  If treating at night, can I wear lotion and a powdered sunscreen the next morning?  wish me luck - I'll post at the end of my 21 days.",4
"extremely uncomfortable and painful in some areas due to my nerve endings being close to the surface of the skin. I take tranquilizers and neurontin to help ease these symptoms, otherwise I am a satisfied user of this product. I use it every 5 years to help with my squamous and basal cell carcinomas.",4
"I'm at the end of the second week. Good thing I am home from work! I would really be in a mess with my face to face contact with the public. I'm only doing my nose and butterfly mask, it's red, purple areas, scabbing in some places. Has anyone heard read the article ""Supercharging Efudex with DMSO?"" The process is excelerated to only 4 days!! Not the 28 days we are going through! But is it safe?? DMSO causes it to rapidly penetrate your skin. Will it hurt the rest of my body??",4
I am at the end of my treatment and have become nausiated and dizzi. I did not relate the two until I gotthe paper out and there it was.,4
"Follow-up - I see postings where people are thinking of discontinuing use due to the discofort, especially on their face. Please, don't give up. Instead ask your doctor about doing it in small sections. Sooo much less discomfort or fear of infection. I wouldn't even consider doing my whole chest at one time.",5
"It worked well for me. My doctor told me I didn't have to do my whole face at one time... so I've been doing it by sections. Sure, it takes longer to get the whole thing done, but lots less discomfort and ugliness. I've finished my forehead (two 4-week sessions) and am now working on my right cheek. The stuff is good!",5
"I used the ceam over my entire face 1xday for 2 weeks. It's now halfway through week three. Ichy, pealy, dry, red skin- ugh! Can't eat without cracking, around my mouth- painful! Lotion irritates it even more. Hopeful that I'll see improvements soon. ",4
"After reading reviews here stating that treatment is awful and painful I was scared witless to start the carac treatment.  It was prescribed to me for AK lesions on my chest and I was to use it once daily at night time.  I am happy to report that the treatment went fast and was no where near as bad as half of these reviews state.  After week one, I did start breaking out with red bumps.  By the end of week 2, I had LOTS of bumps that covered about a 4 inch wide area of my chest and some of them were starting to open.  While it was uncomfortable, it was not by any means painful.  By the end of week 3 some of theopen patches would bleed upon using the cream, but it still wasn't that bad.  I never had trouble sleeping at night.  It was, however, very unsightly just like the doctor will tell you.  I made sure that I wore shirts that covered the entire area during treatment.  I stopped the treatment a week ago and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream to put on the area twice daily.  I've only been using the cream for 3 days and already it is half way cleared up.  It's not even uncomfortable any more, just very itchy.  ",5
"I am beginning my week 2 of treatment.  (twice a day for 21 days)....I am a red head with fair skin.  My doctor wanted me to do a ""mardi gras"" mask to start and do my neck and chest in the winter.  I am beginning to flake and get redder by the day.  It hurts and is very tender to touch.  I am choosing to go to a once a day every other day just to lessen the pain.  I go back to work in 2 weeks....it sounds like at the height of ugliness....I hate not being able to be out in the sun, but I guess that is what got me here...:(  ",3
"I am on day six in using rx.  My cheek was in question, but I had an idea there were problems where my reading glasses sat on my nose.  I am already on fire.  The areas around my nose are the most painful.  I have found several spots that hadn't reared their ugly heads yet.  Moisturizer in the AM helps with pain and tightness.  Any lotion should work or Vaseline.  Can't wait for what I have coming.  I was a sun goddess and am paying for it now.  I think it would be less painful to go in and have these places frozen off instead of the pain and eye swelling an just feeling blah.  Will keep you posted",5
"i am on week 4 of 6 week therapy.started reacting on day 3.it i have it on multiple areas of my body.right now i'm treating face,chest, arms and a couple of spots onlegs for now.very painful.skin is raw right now.have had to skip a day or 2 because of the pain.hope that means it's working.",4

I am now on day 4 post cream & my face continues to peel & crack however redness is beginning to go away.  I am eager for complete healing.   I definitely recommend the full 28 days of treatment if that is a Dr.'s order...",4
"My dermatologist prescribed treatment of forearms and back of hands due to continuous AK, basil cell, and finally a melanoma (different areas of course).  I'm on day 8 since discontinuing treatment and experience continued peeling.  Also appears that I've begun to have a rash and some new spots that look like poison ivy.  Perhaps it is since I worked in the garden yesterday.  Hope I can say it's been worth it once this is over.  Must keep arms covered, very unsightly!",5
"I am a 58 year old male.  I just went through a 5 week treatment regimen of Carac cream.  The first 3 weeks, even the first 4 weeks were tolerable but near the end of the 4th week I started to have open bloody sores.  Normal treatment is 3-4 weeks but my doctor wanted me to go 6 weeks if I could.  After precisely 5 weeks I could no longer tolerate it.  Almost my entire face was bleeding and burning.  I could not sleep at night.  I had to take drugs to get to sleep and still could not lie down on a pillow.    I could not stand anything touching my face.  Showering was a like being engulfed in flames.  I bled all over my pillow, etc.  Finally I just had to stop to let myself heal.  It has been 9 days since I stopped and most of the scabs are gone from my face but it was only in the last 2 days that most of them were removed.  I hope the results are worth it.  The pain and suffering was great. ",4
"Where to start...for me the experience was awful. ot until about day 8 or 9; so I thought I had bucked the system. But once it got awful, it got geometrically worse. Pain, cracking, burning; and this is my FACE we're talking about! But I had done my homework, knew what to expect; and I work from home. So I soldiered on. Only my friends at the post office saw me (I had to mail out orders!) and I mostly stayed at home through the course.",5
"Day 18 of 28 day tx. for my entire face.   My first 'hot spot' was noted on day 4. By day 12 I chose to work from home due to unsightliness & concern for increased risk of infection; I.e.(peeling/cracking/exposed areas).  I clearly could see the progress by this point, however today I'm debating to d/c early due to extreme irritation such as burning, itching, dryness, inflammation around eyes, unsightly appearance & several days of minimal sleep.  I am pleased with the 'new skin' that has replaced sloughed spots butI wish I had clearer M.D. direction re knowing when enough is enough, rather than leaving it up to my own tolerance & discretion; I.e. if no new hot spots appear, is the tx. complete??  Will there be additional damage by applying cream to all the new, healthy skin?   I will write again in a couple days with my decision.  I am very pleased/grateful that this type of tx. is available for my face.",4
"Beginning week two, already have sunburn effect with redened skin,some flaking, ears are very sensitive now, even the pillow contact is uncomfortable.  Sense of skin pulling or tightness.  No reason not to continue with treatment.  Will return and report next week",5
"I finished my 28 day treatment!!  Last time I reviewed this product I was on day 22.  Day 22-28 were suprisingly the hardest! I was so tempted to stop for mostly for emotional reasoning, I was anxious for the end. Day 22-28 my face got the most red, ichy and dry it ever did during the whole 28 treatments. The things I'm most greatful for is the peace of mind, also the ability to use a moistuizer starting the third week.   Advise I would give;  Wash your face only once a day during treatment period. Wait 10 full minutes before putting on Carac Cream.  put vasaline around your eyes and lips before applying cream.  Don't put any product over carac no makeup,sunscreen,moisturizer, unless your doctor says you can.  Funny story; My 11 year old niece was entering my house for a family party with a 5 year old fellow cousin who has not seen me in a while and the 5 year old took a little step back upon seeing my face as I greeted them.  The 11 year old look at me with an expression of ooohhhh so sorry your hurting and quickly looks down at the 5 year old cousin and tells her ""that's not her real face"".  oh out of the mouth of babes.  ;-)  28 days is not a big deal. I went to work, entertained and went out.  GLAD it's over. Glad I have less of a cancer scare and would do it again if I need to.  ",4
"I started my treatments on March 23. I am doing a 28 day treatment. I am on day 22. I wash my face once a day. I prefer night so I can go to sleep through the most ichy time of treatment. The first 4 days my skin did not have a reaction. Days 5-9 my skin started to get slightly irritated. Days 10-14 spots appeared and the skin in my T zone peeled. The irritation stepped up, but nothing more than an extrem dry ichy slightly burning feel. Day 15 my doctor said I was responding very well and I had a moderate reaction.  She also gave me a moisturizer to use, that has alleviated my pain to almost nothing. Day 16-22 my face is red, peeling, dry, irritated, burning but it all goes away, when, I have waited my 2 hours+ and I can put on my moisturizer. All people respond differently so ask you doctor if moistuizer is an option for you otherwise it could impeed your success. I have 6 treatment days to do still. So far the biggest thing was dryness, and it looks terrible. It beats loosing a lip or nostral.   ",5
"I am on day 14 of a 28 day treatment.  I apply Carac once a day all over my face.  My face is very red, peeling and blotchy.  I use a tinted moisturizer in the morning to help hide the color, but now its starting to just show through.  I'm mostly concerned with how dry my skin is and how much worse it will get...??",3
"I am on day 5 of a 2 week treatment. My face and scalp have become red and angry. My eyes have begun to itch. I have also noticed more burning and itching at the day 4 treatment. Look forward to the end of 2 weeks, mainly for the results which I believe will be rewarding considering the trauma my face and scalp have been going through. Onward through the fog...",5
"I am on day 5 of 14 day t/x.  After reading all other reviews I think I'll probably end up being miserable sometime next week.  Don't know if its working other than where I have to put it (upper lip, nose and left cheek) spots are very red, my eyes are burning and its beginning to get very blotchy.  I trust my physician - sure hope this does the trick and I promise I'll never go out without sun screen again.  I'll check in next week with an update.",4
"   I have just completed week two for my face. I now look like I have a moderate case of acne, not too bad. I do feel a little self-concious but I believed that it would be much worse at this point. Some dryness and itching at night but no pain at all. Not looking forward to week three! ",3
"starting week 2-ugly-painful-burns with redness & swelling. treating almost entire face, so probably worse off than others. hope i can make the 4 weeks & end up with good results.",4
"kI used Carac after many bouts w/basil and squamous cell. I applied to face neck chest and arms.The first week wasn't bad but by week 2 things were heating up. By week 3 I was on fire with major redness and swelling, my skin was so tight that I had to apply lotion to open my mouth to eat. Didn't sleep for 1 full week and was unable to go to work as clothing was painful. I finished the treatment everywere except for the face, Dr gave me steriods to discontinue treatment because of severity. In the end it did a great job of finding lots of bad cells and my skin looks great. I just had a squamous cell come up on my nose that I guess it was unable to remove.",3
I have just completed week one of a four week program for my face and have seen no affects at all! I assume it will go downhill from here or I have no bad cells. I will post every week so others can tell how the Carac works week to week. So far so good.    ,2
"Completed four-weeks of 1xdaily on the face. Reviewer who observed that week three is the worst was almost correct. First two weeks, nothing but a little redness and slight burning. Third week it started waking me up at night and had problems eating as skin was very tight. Week three it began flaking and peeling. Shaving with a blade was out of the question. Tried ice packs to keep the swelling down. Week four was very painful; redness started to turn purple and skin was constantly flaking and peeling. Gym workouts were the worst; sweat was like acid on my face. Decided to cut the four week treatment by two days. Have been off the drug for almost a week and this is the first day there has been no discomfort. Redness is greatly decreased but skin is still flaking and peeling. Still a bit of soreness where at creases around the mouth and edge of the eyes.  Skin looks much much better than before medication. Some ""questionable"" discolored places are totally gone.  Now looking for the world's best sunscreen as I'm certain I was the victim of name-brand stuff with little UVA protection. Recommend this product and the full 4-weeks.",4
"Have had this condition for 10 years.red scaly pathc on legs very embarassing and could not wear shorts. Sev dr said i had to live with this rare form of skin cancer.Found new dr who recommended this new cream -I use 2 x pd, red patches and slight burning not bad, use cetaphil creame also. Hope it gets rid of unsightliness....keep you posted.",4
"I  started using this last week for prevention of skin cancer, I had a few small spots.  Was supposed to do for 2 weeks it has been 8 days and my face is on fire, bright red, blotchy patches, burning, feels better with my eyes closed. I can't put this stuff on for another week But as I read previous reviews,  I guess this means it is working. Very hard to go out in public, and I am a sales rep too.. Got lots of looks at the stores I went to today, like I am a freak show. Well I guess I kinda am right now. Will post back  when it heals up, and let others know. Who invented this cream and said ""Fred we got it perfect"" Imagine what they rejected if this is the good stuff....",3
I am on Day 19 of a 21 day treatment. My entire face is very red. It isn't very blotchy but am overall red appearence. It is mainly embarassing to look this way. The only discomfort is stinging and burning for the first hour or so after I apply the Carac at night. My skin is beginning to peel. Aquaphor has been a life saver for me. It is petroleum jelly with lanolin and some other ingredients. I keep some with me at all times and reapply as needed. Just hang in there and know that it really is a short time that may save your life.  ,4
"I started applying this to the top side of my hands and have finished 3 weeks at once a day. Applying it once a day didn't really show any change so when I saw my Dr. yesterday,she said to start applying twice a day as there was no real change.  Even after two days of twice a day now, the redness and scaling are much worse.",4
"I'm finishing week 1 of Carac once daily tomorrow.  So far, some areas of redness, but mild.  I see my doctor in one week.  Have been told week 3 is the worst.  Would appreciate any Carac users experience - how was it week to week?",4
"I just started treatment for my AK 6 days ago. I am pretty uncomfortable, red and blotchy. I am a runner living in New England and the winter weather is not helping. My face is very chapped so I started to put Vaseline on when I run and this has seemed to help. As I am sure everyone else will agree, this beats the alternative of doing nothing and risking my health. Thank God for make-up! I will report back as to the results. ",4
I am in week 2 of 3 and so far I have not had any problems. A little redness.  The area I am treating is very small; about the size od a pencil eraser.,4
"I am a repeat user of this cream and I must say I hate the treatment.  It burns like mad by the end of the second week and my face looks like I've been splattered with hot grease.  But it does a great job clearing up the skin problems and I have not had any long term scarring.  My advice is, don't use the cream in the summer unless you absolutely have to or you're only covering a small area as the added heat seems to intensify the burning and redness.    ",4
"I'm using carac cream for my face as instructed by my doctor.  The discoloration of my skin is not that bad, nothing some face powder is not covering up.  However, the burning is almost unbearable.  I'm having trouble sleeping because of the pain.  I am sleeping with a cold pack on my face to relieve some of the pain.  I have my 2 week follow up in another week and will keep you posted.",2
"Just started treating my entire chest area for pre-cancerous spots (AKs) on my very sun-damaged skin.  Within 3 days of starting treatment, skin broke out severely (raised, bumpy, inflamed red spots). I believe this indicates it's working to attack the damaged areas that have not yet produced precancerous visual symptoms.  Dr. assures me it will get rid of my damage (""liver marks"" and the red, scaly spots that never would go away), improve my skin tone, and most importantly help to reduce the likelihood of skin cancer in the future.  Dr. also says it will get worse before it gets better, but I will be patient and wear turtlenecks to hide it until it's healed. Will report back in 60 days.",4
one week of 2,4
"I have had malignant melanoma, and use this at the first sign of anything unusual. My dermatologist prescribes and monitors my usuage.It is very unsightly as the Rx does its work, but that is better than developing more melanomas. this is my second time to use carac top and I have had no scarring.",5
"I used this medicine on my face.  Side effects of skin erosion and tenderness are super painful.  Redness,scabbing and overall unsightliness are overwhelming and makes me ultra self conscious.  The affected areas on both sides of my face, on the apple of my cheeks.  The affected area is like an upside down triangle, from nose, to hairline, to sides of mouth.  I am now concerned of scarring.",5
"Poison in every sense of the word.  Very low success rate despite all these supposed  'fantastic' ,no doubt, fabricated, pharma reviews",1
Easy fast drug to take as part of my treatment for ovarian cancer in 2011.,5
"Drug was totally ineffective against the clear cell cancer that I have.  Lost six months because this was the ""standard"" treatment for endometrial cancer rather than oncologist looking for drug effective against clear cell.",1
"My father was diagnosed with mesotheloma 02/12. First chemo on May 22, 2012. Had trouble breathing that night, went into hospital,went into kidney failure on dialysis now.",1
"2ost part of my hair, no nausea. 20 months cancer free",5
husband overmedicated-died,1
This is the second time around for carbo. First time was in October 2006 for my husband. So far so good as this is the second treatment of four. No hair loss this time. Lost all his hair the first time. No nausea. He seems to be tolerating treatment much better than the first time.,5
it help me part of the time i do it with gemzar,5
"I have only had 2 treatments so far. It seems to be ok, no serious side effects.",4
This drug along with Taxol IV was used for chemotherapy treatment after lung surgery in 2005. I am happy to say I have been cancer free for 5 1/2 years now. I was very tired during treatments but no other side effect at all. ,5
My mom was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in Dec. 09. Carboplatin was one of the chemo drugs used to treat her cancer. After only one treatment the doctors said that the Carboplatin distroid my mom's kidneys. My mom passed away April 22nd. ,1
"I was initially diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2006 and had three treatments of Taxol and Carboplatin.  After CA-125 increased in 2009, I had six treatments.  I had an allergic reaction from the carbo during treatment #2.  Subsequent treatments included steriods prior to the infusion.  I had no nausea at all - fatigue for a few days after then nominally tired.  I had Neulasta shots right after my treatments to help with my white blood count.",5
first treatment,1
"I had 8 doses with Taxol starting in 2007.  After a rising CA125, I have now had 4 doses.  I had a mild allergic reaction on the 4th dose and will premedicate for the 5th.",4
"Had some fatigue and some nausea, but one more drug helped that. This drug with taxol and I am 4 1/2 years cancer free. Didn't lose my hair, over all not as bad as expected.",5
The combination of this drug and taxol saved my life. I did have an allergic reaction to the taxol but doubling up on steriods helped. The out come was very worth all the side effects!,5
"My experience with this drug was better than I expected. I had no nausea, tiredness-yes but rest was essential. I had a longer time getting my white cell count back but with a shot of Neulasta it improved greatly. ",5
was not as bad as expected but took longer for my bone marrow to recover and so a 4 month treatment took 6months and now after 12 months I need more treatment,5
"Some skin sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, and ringing in the ears.  Nothing that was severe though.  Single treatment following orchiectomy to reduce likelihood of reoccurrence.  ",5
I had a combo of Taxol and Carboplatin for ovarian cancer and had very little side effects other than the usual hair loss and extreme fatigue.  A little nausea and metalic tast for a couple of days but no vomiting.,5
Ii had Ovarian cancer and it has gotten rid of it. altho i have had some in other places in abdoman it had gotten rid of it. am now on carboplatin and my count is down to CA 125 37 and dropping each month,5
No other treatments worked for me.  When my physician added Carfilzomib.  It worked I'm been on this medication for two years I'm in partial remission now.,5
"I have been on this drug for the past 10 months along with a Lupron injection every six months after I completed 44 treatments of radiation.  The side effects are not pleasant, but are becoming more tolerable and less frequent.  The one side effect that has not improved is the hot flashes which occur day and night with more frequency dependent upon how cool I am able to keep my body.  The breast swelling and hair loss on my arms and legs has pretty much leveled off and weight gain and energy loss has improved with exercise and some diet adjustments.  Trips to the bathroom during the night has greatly improved, from 3 to 4 to normally only 1 or 2 times now, but causing some loss of sleep and being tired during the day.  My docs want me to remain on these drug for at least 2 years, so if the side effects remain the same, I should be able to deal with the side effects.  PSA is below 0.1 three months after starting the drugs and has stayed the same.",5
"Diagnosed with high grade prostate cancer although  no evidence of metastatic cancer. PSA dropped from 5.7 to .2 in 3 months and .1 three months later. But the side effects are horrible and I am taking myself off after 9 months. The Lupron/Casodex combo has left me severely fatigued, with joint pain, horrible hot flashes somewhat mitigated by Paxel, sometimes in a mental fog, 7 lbs of weight gain, bald under the arms, raisins for nuts, forget sex, frequent nighttime urination, and a few other things I can't remember. The damn cocktail works but docs keep you on it too long. After radiation and with an undetectable PSA, there seems to be no reason to continue this crap for another 9 months. So I'm in charge and I quit.         ",5
"Been on 50mgs/day with Trelstar shot every 3 months for almost 2 years, PSA went below 1 in first 6 months and has stayed there. Experience extreme fatigue now. Experience breast tenderness and hair loss in first 6 months. Not happy with side affects. As time goes by breast tenderness is decreasing and is now tolerable, same with hot flashes.",5
"I had no serious side effects.Coincidently, or not, I required major periodontal surgery during my treatment period, due to significant bone loss. A previous reviewer had mentioned ""loss of teeth"" as possible side effect.",5
"I started casodex over 4 years ago, initially 50 mg per day for one month on it, then 2 months off. Later moved to 100 then 150 mg/day, still some months on, some months off.  Whenever PSA went up to around 3.0, I went back on the medication. My PSA is still under 3.0 though the drugs effectiveness may be nearing the end for me.  Virtually no side effects for me.",4
"i am writing this for my husband,casodex,only treatment avabile,with out a three month shot,that cost's 2000.00,called lupron.casodex daily will kipp my husband in romission indeffintly.how can he be treated so rude. ",1
I have been on Casodex (and Lupron shot) for 18 months. I get bad hot flashes but nothing else. It seems successful at this point. Time will tell. Good luck to us all.,5
Total loss of sexual stimulation.  Will this ever return after i stop casodex,5
"Started casodex week before surgery 6 1/2 months ago,both psa test since has shown non-detectible. Although gleason score was 9, pathology after surgery was great. Primary side effects, fatigue, breast pain, joint & musclepain, sharp pains in side & stomach, irregularity,slight nausea, drowsiness, gas,indigestion, weight gain even after arobic workouts 6 times per week (wondering if it impedes metabolism), frequent urination, & a few other side effects. Unsure as to how long I will need to take med.  Still thankful for it.",5
"I have adenocarcinoma of the prostate. After four months on Casodex, 50 mg per day, my PSA went down from 10.7 to 3.1. two weeks later it measured 3.0.  Side effects are breast swelling and tenderness, and diminution of ejaculate, but nothing debilitating.",4

Iused tis medication to reduce psa rating,3
hot flashes.,5
Taking this drug for 5 years. Once a day. Have PSA checked every three months. It has been as low as 0.01 and is currently 0.60. I had seeds and radiation done before taking this medicine. That did not work. Medicine $546 which I paid $124 each month. I went to the VA and I now pay $9.00 a month for a y30 day supply. It has gone generic.,5
I feel great since my doctor prescribed this medication,4
"Extreme, debilitating muscular back pain, took several weeks after discontinuing before could begin to live comfortably. Still have periodic knots in muscle.  ",1
Diagnosed with Stage II prostate cancer in 2007.  Radiation treatment then hormone shot and PSA test every six months.  Casodex every day.  PSA has been 0.00 since first checkup after completing radiation. ,5
"Does what it says on the box. The main side effect is severe fatigue, I'm often so tired I can hardly move. Having said that, it's very effective, and certainly better than the alternative.",4
" I took casodex for 2 months &it gave me seaver poops,lots of peeing at night,lack of sleep,&now am explosion of hair folicles  all over my body. It stoped night chills&the hypoglicemia from Zoladex.I stopped Casodex.",1

My husband has been on Casodex 50MG for almost a month and so far so good.  Appears to have helped the pain he has experienced in his back and the only side effect appears to be that most foods have no taste.,4

SATISFACTORY,5
i have bin takeing for 2.5 years,5
"Been on this drug for 9 months along with hormone injections every 3 months and the drug avodart also. A three sided attack. Previously had hormone and radiation for 9weeks, cancer spread after that. Psa was up to 17 in a few months. Since taking casodex along with the other treatments PSA has gone immediatly to under 1. Very tired all the time, gained weight and freq urination but my numbers are down. It's better than the alternative.",5
My friend has stage 4 prostate cancer and is using this drug. I would like more information on this drug.,3
"My father is 89 & has multiple serious medical conditions. He has been on 50 mg daily of Casodex, plus a Lupron injection once every 4 months.  His numbers are fantastic.  But my mom & dad are going broke from the treatment.  And my father is all of a sudden losing his teeth.  Another fortune. We don't know if it has anything to do with the treatment.

After G.I. inserted feeding tube, started 80 radiation treatments w/3 rounds of chemo..first day, middle of treatment and last day.8a.m.thru ,5p.m. w/8 bags of saline simultaneously to protect kidneys.Thyroid and most saliva glands destroyed by rad, now take thyroid drug daily, and lots of h2o for dry mouth.Nausea controlled very well with meds. Scar tissue in throat has never improved, so after 2+years on feed tube, am very careful about choking episodes.pills need crushing or cutting up...also had all my teeth removed right before treatment started, as I needed extensive dental work which drs said no time to complete...they wanted me to start chemo etc immediately after surgery and feeding tube placement.Very fatigued thru treatment,with 80lb weight loss.Mouth was severely painful with very thick thrush,med.rinses etc not effective.Also, severe diarrhea and dehydration, you just don't want anything, even water in your mouth.Took me a long time to regain any energy,and not getting adequate nutrition had alot to do with that....I lived on Ensure in feeding tube. 8 years out, I'm totally clear, and very grateful.I have significant hearing loss, vision changes, memory loss. Thought these might eventually clear up, but after 8 years.....Food and beverages taste awful, particularly wine, which I was very into. All in all? I've seen alot worse experiences. I now know from all my subsequent reading and research that if I had had more time to prepare, I could've helped myself alot more, but it was a totally unexpected shock, and I was rushed into everything with my drs and all other caregivers directing me to one appt to the next in a blur!

Also about 3 years later I started forming lumps in my breasts. Not sure if this is related or in direct correlation with my immune system being compromised. I was very sick during treatment and was unable to absorbs nutrients through my food. This is still true today and I'm a very unwell 25 year old. ",1

"I was treated with a combination of cisplatin and taxotere for ovarian cancer. The treatment was administered thru two ports, one in my left shoulder and one directly into my stomach cavity. After six months of chemo my cancer went into remission but I have been left with a severe case of neuropathy and lymphodema. This drug combination has given me almost five years and I have to be very grateful to my doctor and his team who took very good care of me. I was very weak during the treatments for about three out of four weeks and then back for more,however I only got sick once in the six months of treatment. ",5
Did not  notice amny side effects.,3
My hair fell out within two weeks of this treatment and it makes my stomach hurt.,4
"Had cancerous parotid salvia gland removed(10/08) followed by 6 sessions of chemo (Cisplatin and Taxotere). Never got sick, but used Emend & Anzmet the day of treatment. Also took the Emend for two days following. The steriod taken was Decaron. The cancer had spread to the chest and lung and the chemo (11/08-3/09) was successful.  Eight months later the cancer returned to the neck, which was removed. Radiation of head neck followed (33 sessions). Also during this time a nodule was found in the brain. Simultaneous to the radiation I had CyberKnife of the brain done. A double dose of radiation.  The fatigue, and side effects, caused by the radiation was greater than chemo, but, one month since the last radiation, I am very hopeful about the future.",4
"This Drug left my dad with a condition called autonomic neuropathy.He is incontinent,can not walk, blood pressure issues, and the list goes on and on. The cisplatin got rid of the cancer,but the side effects ruined the quality of his life. He now lives in a long term facility.  ",4
"this is the nastiest chemo drug there is my doctor told me it would be, and that a couple of weeks i would start getting sick with it 4 hours after my first treatment i started vomiting and did not stop for the next 6 months i lost about 70 pounds during my treatments and as ugly as it was it did save my life i was a stage 4 npc- and i am very lucky to be alive so i have to say i am satisfied with it but dont fool your self it is the most horrible drug but if you have to chose life or death its pretty good",5
"I took cisplatin& etopaside for test.cancer, very eff. for me. I also suffered from loss of memory.So far my short term mem. has returned.Short term side effect.I hope this helps.",5
"My 71-year-old mother received a six-month course of treatment with cisplatin by IV and IP (port into the lower abdominal cavity) and taxol by IV for her stage III-c ovarian cancer.  Her CA 125, which was 200 pre-surgery to remove cancerous masses, dropped to 50 before cisplatin/taxol treatment and got down to 3 at the end of treatment.  She was declared cancer-free in July '08 and was determined to have a recurrence this month (August '09).  Her side effects from cisplatin were nausea/vomiting (mild) and neuropathy in her hands and feet (moderate to severe).  Her finger numbness largely disappeared within six months of completing treatment; when it was active, she could not button her blouse, open a letter or write normally.  The foot neuropathy remains - she has permanent numbness in her toes and on the soles of both feet, alternating with random shooting pains that make it difficult at times for her to wear shoes or stand up for more than a few minutes at a time.  The nausea/vomiting started by the second month of treatment; the neuropathy did not come on until four months in and got much worse between her fifth and sixth (last) months of treatment.",5
This is a great drug I recommend it very much so.,5
BRIEF BOUT OF NAUSEA.  ,5
8/2005 i was diagnosed with stage 3b cervical cancer. had a radical hysterectemy. did 6 rounds of cisplatin with 6wks of radiation. just had my 6mo pet scan..and all is good. :)was very sick from side affects...but am alive!!,5
"!5 years ago I received cisplatin IV post surgically for dx of ovarian cancer.  In the years since, I hae developed peripheral neuropathy, sepcially in the feet and I am wondering if it could be a side effect from that drug.  I also received cytoxin at the same time.  Any experiences or anectodotal information would be appreciated.",5
My husband who has since passed away was extremely sick after only one treatment with cisplatin.  It lowered his blood counts so much that he went sepsis and almost died from this treatment.,1
"was very nauseated and weak, but no reoccurrences of germ cell ovarian tumor",5
"Cannot move , loss of balance its nearly six months the treatment end but still cannot walk properly , always diprest , loss of memory, cannot do work properly. ",3
This chemo made me very sick but saved my life!!! They didn't think I was going to make it but thanks to this chemo and radiation (internal and external) I am still here!!! I took this chemo through an i.v. 2 years in a row for 8 weeks once a week.,5
Stage three cancer at base of tongue.  Now 45 months in remission.  Received 62 radiation and 21 hrs of Cisplatin.  Wore feedng tube for 14 months.  Was tough going for several months but I got through it and feel good so far.  ,5

"My mom had to take it for Erdheim Chester Disease (form of histiocytosis).  It helped shrink some of the lesions in her brain, but never really affected her disease process positively, or helped her regain any normalcy of life.",3
The only things I found was after the 1 week treatment I was getting very tired and my eating was less then my normal eating habits.  A few days after the treatment finished I was having fevers so I had to stay in the hospital for 9 days which wasnt so terrible other then getting constant blood transfusions and bloodwork being done and just plain being stung with needles like a pin cushion.,5
cannot tell yet to early to say,3
"I've been on Crizotnib for about 6 months now.  It seems to be working overall but there's now question as to if my body is starting to figure it out...in which case I'll have to switch to something else.  Overall, this medication has been wonderful.  Only had a little diarreah in the bigginning but only a couple times.  I doubt I would be alive right now if it wasn't for this drug.",4
This medication in 3 weeks reduced my tumor 75%. I have had some side effects but were not life threatining,4
All Lung Cancer patients should have a biopsy tested for ALK.  Crizotinib (Xalkori) has virtually none of the miserable side effects of traditional Chemo.,5

"I have been on Cellcept twice. The first time was for almost 2 years the dose was 1500 mgs. twice daily. It lowered immunities to the point that I picked up a rare infection and put me in the hospital for over a month. After 3 years, the Scleroderma came back with a vengeance on my lungs. I'm back on the same dose of cellcept as of 4/12 and on oxygen 24/7. Both times I did get a bacterial overgrowth in my stomach that is treated  with flagyl. ",5
I took this to get my Lupus under control. There were no side effects until I got my blood work back from the lab. My liver was in failure. I was put on another med and my liver was back to normal in a few months.,1
"Started treatment with this medication after a recurrance of OC after it being resolved 2 years ago.  Liking this one so far, no hair loss, nausia is manageable, some fatigue and response to treatement has been good so far.",4
"This medicine has worked as well as on can hope. This is my 8th battle of cancer and i think my doctors just wanted to try something else. I am a college student living on campus and this medicine still lets me work, go to school and have a somewhat normal college experience. I think the nausea has been what is been the hardest part, but it is better than Chemotherapy.",3
"I have taken this drug since May 2009, my dosage has been 100mg daily.  I really have had no significent side effects from this drug as of today!!  My PFT's have been stable since beginning this drug, they had me on cellcept before this.  I take 5mg of pred daily as well.    ",5
I have only been on this drug for 2 months so it is hard to tell if it is working yet. I have been losing some hair though. My appetite has decreased. When I eat I start feeling sick so I have to stop. I think my breathing is better but it is a very subtle change.,3
"My father was on this drug and had to taken off due to mental effects, keep in mind this was mixed with dexamethasone. he had confusion and delusions.",4
"one in line with many drugs, this one is super! little to no side effects. I've had problems w/ diarrhea, and some immune problems that were resolved by antibiotics. hair loss but not completely. hair grows back after a few months, dark circles under eyes and around mouth. This is the best drug for me in all areas and effectiveness. Last drug I was on triggered peripheral neuropathy which has limited my driving and mobility!",5
I have recently been placed on drug and have not had enough treatment to determine its effectiveness.,2
"After using interferons successfully for years, I began to progress and nothing seemed to help the relapses.   I was on cytoxan without steroids every 2-3 weeks for 26 months.  When we kept my wBC (white blood count) between 2.0 and 2.5, I felt better, had more energy and fewer symptoms that impacted my life day to day.  I did lose most of my hair and became B12 deficient and anemic and towards the end of the 2 year mark, began to have fewer good days than bad.  At that point, the decision was made to stop treatment.  6 months later I had fewer symptoms of MS and my MRI was quiet and I had more energy than I had had in more than 20 years.   It was a very good therapy for me considering others I had tried and gave me good quality of life afterwards for more than two years since I have finished the medication.",4
i have been on this drug for almost two years i just got of becauce of the lentgh of time on it it made me very sick the first weaks of my tranfusun and made my hair very thin it slowed down my lesons but im still progresseng,2
"Very satisfied. Been  receiving this treatment every few years or so since I was 15 years old. I just celebrated my 38th Birthday and was able to conceive my little girl who is perfectly healthy. Works better than the pills. My blood pressure goes down significantly. Thats how I was able to conceive because the physicians were able to take me off my pressure pills after treatment for 6 months. I maintained a six year remission, but developed hypertension again during my ninth month of pregnancy, but would do it all again. You do experience nausea and fatigue during the night but it doesn't last too long. Was able to attend and complete graduate school and work my full time job while taking it because I was using it with a series of good multivitamins, Fish oil and Ensure to replace the cells and regenerate my body.",5

"In May 2002 I went into the hospital and was diagnosed with AML.  Today is Monday, December 22, 2008 - over 6 years later I am still suffering side affects.  Actually, I felt as if I was losing it.  I still have the red pin point spots on my body.  I have suffered with chronic bone pain - tingling sensations throughout my whole body since using this medication.  I have a degenerative nerve condition that has caused a motor nerve change on my left side.   This is the first time I have visited this site and looked up this medication.  I reviewed the comments of someone who said they have been experiencing side affects after 3 years.  I just want to thank you for your comments, because I really felt I was going crazy.  Thank You Again for posting your comments.  God Bless You.   ",4
"Although this medication did give me a second chance at life, I am still dealing with side effects from this drug, 3 years later.  I have no feeling in my right leg from the knee down, I have no feeling in the first digits of my fingers, my left foot is also numb. I thought these effects would vanish over time, but my doctor has told me due to the high doses I was given the feeling may never come back to me.  I was on a coctail of chemotherapy agents, this was one of the many. I did lose all my hair, and would vomit frequently, even the smell of food made me sick. I was given a very slim chance at survival so I'm not complaining much about my experience at all.  I'm glad every day for those pins and needles. It's just my little reminder of how far I have come. Annoying? YES, but I just keep going!",4
"I have been taking infusions of DTIC for 7 months beginning in Jan. 2011.  I have melanoma on my tongue, the associated lymph node and also in my lung.  As of the last scan the one on the lymph node and those in my lung seem to have shrunken and the one on my tongue did not show up. The lymph node has shrunked from a lime size tumor to as small as a walnut size but it does seem to change.  I have had a problem with my lungs that they think is a side effect of the chemo but have been unable to identify. I have been on oxygen 24/7 for about 45 days and it seems to be clearin up a little. I expect to start on Zelobraf in pill form this week.  Side effects were rough at first but I was not taking the medication for depression.  When I did start taking the medications it was much better.",4
"The ""D"" in the AVBD protocol.  Took this drug back in 1983 for stage III-B Hodgkin's.  Very effective!!!  The main problem I had was during the administration of this drug as it will have the sensation of burning the vein.  The nurse checked and determined that the drug was not diffusing into surrounding tissue.  I recommend if you have this problem, use relaxation therapy techniques.... before relaxation, it took 4 hours to administer the drug due to the slow drip rate (to combat the pain in the vein).  While using relaxation took all of 20 minutes and no pain.  ",5

"While this drug is easy to use and great for the treatment of CML its side effects are sometimes bothersome and hard to deal with on a daily basis most doctors tend to think that the side effects you tell them your experiencing are from other things and not from the medication, It does stop the disease in its tracks and with continued use keeps it at bay however it can become toxic and cause other side effects to manifest  many which are treated with discontinued use until they receed and then a smaller dosage is given to keep the disease in check. I suffered toxicity which lead to severe anemia, renal failure, and congestive heart failure because it was not followed up on frequently enough but once the med was stopped function returned with treatment, however it is in the pt's interest to keep these side effects in check and closly monitored, such as edema which can be severe,stiffness in the joints and limbs as well as severe swelling in the lower legs,decreased urine output,andchest pain associatred from the severe fluid retention. It should also be noted that several diuretics were prescribed but not effective with the renal failure",5

Further, the reviewers also give a low rating for ""ease of use""...really, taking this pill is magically different than taking any OTHER pill?

A lot of facial pain and tenderness. I lost some taste and appetite has increased tremendously. I get dizzy spells and very cranky on this medication as well. I feel bad for my fiance. I can feel myself getting mad over the littlest things.

"I was on a 20 mg/week dose for 2.5 years. Compared to other chemo treatments, this drug was a piece of cake.  After a 7 mo rest, I'm on a 20, a 4, and then a 4 mg dose for three consecutive days every week again. It relieves bone pain, boosts my spirits, and controls G.I. chemo issues before the dose wears off after a few days. I can live with a little sleep loss, but then there is a post-dose crash after a few days that I have to get through.

Puffy face, red blotchy rash/itching on face. Also made me irritable/agitated. Bad drug. Would not recommend this drug to reduce swelling in back. It appears to be the wrong drug for my issue. PA at urgent care clinic probably should have prescribed a short-order of prednisone which I can take.  I looked at other reviews.  Side effects/allergic reactions are pretty severe.  I would not recommend this drug.  ",1

"The reason I took the drug is not in the list above, I took it for swelling related to dental implants. Severe Headache & very severe eye pain. I stopped using after 5 pills as the pain continued to get worse. Pain was gone after drug wore off. ",1
"It has controlled my MM very well. But the side effects are terrible. I have gained 50 lbs on it, became very irritable, mood swings, taste of food is horrible and at times have metallic taste in mouth, swelling in feet and ankles, ended up with catatracts after only 8 months, had surgery on both eyes, constant respiratory infections, confusion can't do simple things I do every day,extreme sweating even in an air conditioned room at 68 to 70 degrees the sweat is running down my face and my co workers are freezing. Have had just about every side effect possible with this, but it controls my MM and I can't take anything else. They had given me Rev and Thal and had such bad reactions I had to be taken off of them. So as long as I can tolerate this I will stay on it. Have been on Decadron/Dexamethasone for since Dec. 2007.",5
has this medication made anyone exremmly angry?,4
"high dose, tapered over 4 days resulting in psychosis with suicidality",1
"I am waiting to see a neurosurgeon as I have swelling in my brain and was prescribed this drug - I have had horrible side effects - bloating, dizziness, aggressiveness, insomnia, puffy face, swollen eyelids - horrible, horrible, horrible drug. I am hoping to take something else to reduce the swelling, but the side effects are horrible. I feel completely out of sorts and even if it's working, the physical agony doesn't even seem worth it. Add to that, it causes ulcers so I am taking a prescription pepcid pill which is causing severe constipation. I have never felt so horrible in my life - not even when I had surgery for breast cancer. There has to be a better way.",2
I was given 2 1/2 tablet at ER as a one time dose for severe swallowing problems due to a thoat infection with ear and lymph gland association.  withi9n 8 hours my pain was greatly improved.,5
"What fun it is taking a drug like this,the side effects for me start with eye pain,head- aches,eating all the time,weigh gain,up every hour to wee-wee,dizzy all the time,and many more.But in all fairness I have to say it works for me. I was tired of going to chemo 5 days a week for years.I take 10 4mg pills a day for 4 days then off for 5 days  and start over .But I'am still living the good life.",4
"My doctor prescribed me this medication for an inflamed eustachian tube. I have never experienced this before and it has been annoying and painful (hard to swallow, eat, drink, yawn, etc.). I am only prescribed to take one in the morning for three days along with a nasal spray. I took my first one this morning and it is 7 p.m. and the pain is gone. I just feel some heartburn, but I'd rather have some heartburn than deal with the pain of the inflammation. It has worked great so far.",5
Decreased platelets due to leukemia. Bruising and bleeding under the skin. Been on for 4 days. A little less bleeding and bruises fading. A little jittery and not sleeping real well but arthritis in feet much improved  ,3
"Prescribed for headaches and nausea from radiation on the brain. It has relieved both of those, however I crave food all the time and the meds give me heartburn which is not a good combo.  Also having issues with bowels and unable to really sleep even when taking sleep meds.  The relief it gives outweighs the side effects without a doubt.",4
"I have been experiencing muscle spasms,aching, radiating nerve pain in my left shoulder, leftside of next and arm.  It's a good possibilty that I have a ruptured disc in my neck that is irritating the nerve and cuasing the pain in my shoulder blade and arm.  for the past few days I have been having really really bad muscle spasms in my neck and shoulder and the side effect of that has been sending a shooting pain down my arm and hand on the left side.  After taking this medication for one full day out of a five day prescription, the muscle spasm are almost completely gone and the overall cramping in my shoulder is now bearable.  Obviously it will not fix the possibility that I might have a ruptured disc in my neck, but it has now made it manageable until I can have my MRI and decide if I need surgery to rectify the problem.  I have done physical therapy and tried other pain killers and anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxer and none have given me the relief that this medication has given me.  It does make me nauseous, slightly jittery, and some times a little dizzy....but that is much easier to deal with than the pain I was having.  The benefits have definitely out weighed the risk in my situation. ",4
"I've been taking this medication for the past eight months due to breast cancer and spinal issues due to the cancer spreading into my bones and blood. I started with 16mg and now have been happy to say I am now on .5 mg this medication has the worst side effects I've ever noticed. I take lots of meds due to my health and the side effects of this medication  is unbearable. It truly helps with pain and allows me to do things maybe I wasn't unable to do but the WEIGHT GAIN and UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO EAT is crazy. Chocolate, sweets anything you just can't stop eating. I've gained 50 pounds, I use to weigh  110lbs and now I weigh 160pds.and I don't even know how to carry it. It's hard to get dress, pick things up off the floor and its all in the mid-section and my face is like a balloon. I look as though I'm having a child. If it wasn't for the weight gain and the urge to always eat constantly this med would be fine. I can't wait to be completely off. There has to be something better out there, or a way to stop the urge to constantly EAT EAT EAT !!!!!!!!!!!",2
"Took for pain in shoulder from small tendon tear and mild arthritis. now have more pain then to begin with,( all over),cant sleep, and pounding heart when I laid down. Only took 2 pills in 4 days, not gonig to finish it.",1
"wow have taken 5 days of this medicine starting with 4 for 3 days and then 3 for 3 days and im quitting it, i havent slept and im a nervous wreck and a zombie. I quit it 2 days ago and im still feeling it, it is still in my system. even when i lie down and close my eyes i dont sleep, i can still hear every little dust particle..this is crazy....never again",2
very good for childhood asthma,4
"I was given 2 1/2 of these pills in the E.R. due to a swollen and sour neck and throat from an unknown infection to my tonsils.  The following day I noticed a huge decrease in the pain, swelling and tenderness.  Seems to have worked great for me.  It was given one time, and one time only.  I really had no side effects at all. Works great! A+!!",5
"Well, I usually dont come back and leave a review on anything unless it just STINKS but on rare occasion I am so pleased with something i HAVE to share. I have MS(Dx 7/2005 at 34). I have taken this oral 4mg pikk 3x daily to fight MS flare ups. This flare up was especially bad leaving me unable to even care for myself at the most basic levels. Doc phoned in this med. Started my 3x daily at noon yesterday and took on ein the evening before bed. I am SO pleased that I woke up this morning with marked improvement in ability to walk, and stand. I actually could take a shower and I just got back from Wawa to get FRESH milk for my morning coffee when i have not been ablt to drive there, navigate the store and line and register and drive home safely in WEEKS! I know this isnt a miracle pill and Im far from back to my old baseline of ability but just the fact I regained my ability for the simplest tasks really made me grateful that these little tic-tacs are helping me. I remain hopeful to see where they get me over the next 72 hours of treatments. I know steroids are like treating poison with poison but when you so sivck you feel like you're dying anyhow it's so worth the gamble.",4
shattered toothe do to a fall in the middle of the night.  Only taken four doses so far and the relief is great.  having toothe extracted by oral surgeon tomorrow.  nervous as hell and can't sleep from anxiety...but sure the relief will be....can't wait for the pain to stop!!!!,4
"Had a fall and fractured back top tooth, severe pain...Just started this medication this morning and the relief is amazing.!",4
"Currently taking this to reduce swelling from a shattered tooth that I will be having surgery on. This is a tough med to take as it causes severe mood swings, irritability (you will become a raving b itch) and hunger. And the hunger especially sucks when you can't eat due to the teeth pain. But, I will say this - it does reduce the swelling. If your doctor insists, then take it, but if you have time and can let swelling subside slower and on its own than I'd recommend to do so. Unfortunately for me, I need it to turn around fast as I need the surgery. Good luck and happy eating! And don't kill your husband!! ;) ",3
"I was given this medication to get rid of a rash on my legs. I have felt very weird. I don't feel like mt self at all. My head hurts want to sleep all the time, but can't. Feel jittery and wired, not relaxed, and I am feeling some anxiety.",4
"This was prescribed to reduce some swelling in my throat as I was recovering from chemo/radiation treatment for cancer of the larynx.  It worked well in that respect and was easy to use, however, the side effects were tough to deal with.  After 11 days, taking 4 times a day, my feet and ankles were enormous and muscle weakness in my legs.  I could barely walk, couldn't step up onto a curb or climb steps, get up from a sitting position without GREAT effort or help. The incision from where my feeding tube was removed wasn't healing either - all side effects from this med.  Dr. decreased dosage amt. slowly and I was feeling much better within a month.  Listen to your body and report what it is telling you to your doctor ASAP.  Pay attention to the side effects listed. ",4
It has helped the platelet problem ITP but Iam left with a swollen face ankles and a rash here and there. Now that I have stopped therapy I am shakey and tired. ,5
"I had a small infection on my lower leg around the ankel. The drug kept me awake for days made me very nervous and of corse very tired . Then became very irritable and then depressed and still very irritable. An over all bad experence. I only took the drug for 4 days. then stopped it,and now 6 days later still not doing well.",1
"prescribed to me after dental surgery w/ periodontist....took 6 tabs of 0.75 mg today, day of surgery, will take 3 tabs tomorrow and 2 tabs the following day, then no more...My thinking seems clear, very high / low mood swings, hunger is there and absolutely no pain anywhere today, not even the usual joint pain from arthritis.  Note I did take other drugs, including Darvocet for pain but I had the other side of my mouth done 6 months ago and I KNOW the pain will set back in after I taper from this med.  I sure appreciate it's effect except for the rampant mood swings. ",5
I used this drug due to an infection in my jaw --- the point was to reduce inflammation. I am a type 1 diabetic on an insulin pump and I had to stop taking it after my first dose because I can not keep my blood sugar any lower than 495. I have taken almost 3 days worth of insulin in one day with unsuccessful control. I would not recommend to other diabetics.,2

"I am currently taking a 6 day pack for an allergy to poison ivy. I am on day 3 and have had bad side effects. I feel like I have a very very hard heart beat. The 2nd day I was so dizzy I fell, constant heart burn. Today has been confusing, and I have presented anxiety. In the evening I have been experiencing dryness. It feels as though my whole body is dry, dehydrated. On a good note, the poison ivy allergy is slowly clearing up and I dont have the ""insane itch"". ",4
"I'm on a short-term low dose as my RE tries to find out why I either don't conceive or I conceive then miscarry.  I've had the hunger, bloating, peeing, thirst, and sleep problems (but I already had sleep problems so may not be the med).  But nothing I can't live with, and definitely not the worst side-effects I've ever had.  Have had way worse side-effects from some antibiotics, Lunesta, glucophage, Rozerem.  The lower dose may be part of that.  Have no idea if the med is effective or not, but it's not been too bad for me.",3
"I was given this for inflammation in my gums that caused severe sensitivity in my teeth. It worked very well for reducing the inflammation, but the side effects were dreadful. I had been put on Prednisone earlier in the year, and had bad side effects from that but these toppped that. I had constant cravings and hunger; I gained 20 pounds because of it. I had weird dreams, and woke up constantly from terrible night sweats. I would soak the bed and pillows. I was extremely irritable and shakey. I was extremely hyper and anxious. My urine became very cloudy and I had horrible water retention/bloating. I had horrible nausea, dizziness, and heartburn. I had terrible headaches and an irregular monthly cycle. It interfered with my birth control pills. I also wound up in the emergency room due to a rare side effect in which I had severe pain in my legs to the point that I couldn't walk. I then had to be put on a prescription pain reliever that is normally given to people after surgeries. The experience of being on this drug were worse than my pregnancy and ceasarean section combined! It did its job, but the side effects were not worth it. I would try to find another drug. ",4

"I was prescribed this for canker sores. I get them frequently and sometimes have many at once. Last week I had eight show up at once and 4 of those were on the inside of my top lip. I had lots of pain, difficulty eating and talking and my lip was swelled horribly. The directions given by my dentist were to rinse with the Dexamethasone twice a day...hold in my mouth as long as I could stand and then spit out. It really helped. By the next day the swelling was gone and the pain was getting better, by the second day the sores were going away and by the fourth they were almost entirely cleared up.",5

"I take this drug for three days starting the day before my chemo.  I have not had any major side effects.  This drug gave me enough energy to carry on normally during my chemo days.  My knees were painful before taking this drug and the pain is gone completely.  I found it hard to sit down because of so much energy, but I have welcomed my new energy and I am very pleased with this drug. Chemo is no fun...but this drug has made it bearable. ",5

I am using this medicine after having fusion back surgery.  He said it is to help keep my swelling down.  The side effects are harsh though.  I have to eat or I get very gittery and I eat ALOT.  I can't sleep at night because I wake up sweating so bad and I am breaking out.  I am also experiencing bruising and cutting my skin very easily. I was hoping to know how long afer I am off of the medicine does it take to get out of your system.,3
"I am undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.  I'm taking Taxol and this drug is used in pill form of 5 tablets of 4 mg each the pm then am before the Taxol chemotherapy treaatment.  Due to the high risk of allergic reaction to Taxol, this is why they have me on the drug. I am also taking Benadryl to combate the allergic reactions. My first treatment I had severe reactions immediately to Taxol and was given additional Dex and Benadryl and it worked.  My second treatment I had less of an reaction later in the treatment of Taxol and required additional Dex and Benadryl.  Dex seems to be working and I have only experienced mood swings.",4
"Unlike most other posts here, I've had very few problems with side effects. I'm on a wide range of chemo and OTC drugs, with Dex being just one. My indigestion is controlled with a prescription heartburn med., and I've noticed no taste decrease or increase of appetite (maybe because of the chemo?). The dex has been VERY effective in treating my myeloma, and my back pain is nearly gone. ",5
"Taken for: Optic Neuritis.  By the time I was given this medication, I had lost all vision in my left eye.  Within 3 days, I gained most it back (20,30).    My doctor kept me on this med for 2 months because the swelling/pain in my legs/knees from Fibromyalgia/Osteoarthritis was greatly reduced.   My energy level jumped through the roof.  I could get up in the morning (no stiffness) and had the energy to shower, cook breakfast, go shopping.  I hadn't been able to do that for 3 years (even with meds like lyrica).  He took me off of this drug and my energy dropped and pain slowly returned.  I miss this medication even though the side effects are a bit overwhelming.  I had massive cravings for food, but I was on the atkins diet so I did not gain any weight (but no loss either).  Also, I became very irritable.. almost like I lost my inner censorship voice.  I would just say whatever came to mind with no forethought for how it might affect the person listening.  Although I found this a bit funny (I usually try way too hard to be a people pleaser), others were not so happy.  ",5

my 2yr old son was given the medication because of a constant dry cough. the dr said it sounded like an 'asthma cough'...it worked very well. the pharmacists that filled the prescription did not give any paperwork on side effects or anything...he has had an increase of appetite and pretty moody...but he has also just turned TWO years old!.... ,5
"My doctor rx'd this for treatment of plantar fascitis. It has worked well, but my appetite increased greatly and my mood became more irritable. I have noticed some edema in my ankles on the 3rd day after tapering down and stopping the medication. But in fairness I had to fly home for a funeral, so this probably contributed. Overall I am pleased with this treatment. It beats having steroid injections into my foot!",4
"untreated lung/brain cancer. used to address symptoms and is prolonging and making my life bearable. the side effect are terrible but I'll trade them any day for the vision loss, dementia, unbearable headaches with eye pain.

"This medication was prescribed for an allergic skin reaction.  While the medication cleared the reaction, it was extremely difficult to tolerate.  Excessive thirst, very frequent urination, profuse sweating or ""hot flashes"", and sleeplessness were just a few of my side effects.

"After I had lumbar back surgery I had pain in my legs 100 times worse than before the surgery. I figured it was somewhat normal considering the surgery and timing of the pain. The pain came on when the medicine gradually ran out of a small ball like ?pump thingy that put anesthetic stuff on my surgery site few days after surgery. I was put on the steroid by my surgeon for 10 days, taper down after 4mg. 3times a day for 3 days. It DID take 95% of the worst pain in  my legs due to the inflammation of surgery, BUT I HATE this drug! it completely messed up my ability to taste, constant hunger, very sore tongue,irritable, I just feel there could have been some other drug used to adequately treat the inflammation/pain WITHOUT the EXTREMELY terrible side effects.

I was able to go to work after treatments and have not missed a day since the treatments started.

Painful mouth sores, typical nausea controlled by medication, constantly tired.  Neulasta probably contributed to severe bone pain. treatment every two weeks; pain and some tiredness lasted first week only. Tumor did shrink almost 50% but grew right back in one month; I managed to work through treatment but treatment probably would have worked better if I got proper rest and less job-related stress.  I DO NOT recommend working through this treatment; it was absolutely brutal.  I'm now on disability taking Taxol with Avastin every week and it's a breeze in comparison!  Also, we need to push to get Chemo-brain recognized as a condition; all who experienced it know exactly what I mean!

"After several different chemo drugs, Doxil worked the best.  Taken once a month, no hair loss, no side effects other than dizziness & a little nausea the day of treatment.  Tumors shrunk significantly & did not spread.  One tumor was gone completely.  No new growth.  Baseline of the heart decreased slightly, but nothing to be too concerned about.  After over a year of successful treatment, doctors canceled treatment for 8 months until a new growth appeared. Unfortunately, can no longer receive this wonderful drug.",5
Have had 3 treatments and so far no bad side effects.,3
Once a month IV. Minimal side effects and I even kept my hair which everyone said I'd lose!,5
" Doxil, as part of a trial at UH Hospitals with an immunotherapy shot, has reduced my tumors by 26% after 5 treatments. I got hand/foot syndrome and it was difficult to be on my feet for very long. I soaked my feet in 'Instant Ocean', put them on ice, and used 'Utter cream' which seemed to help. I would wake up at 3:00 am with terrible burning and itching feet and got only temporary relief after putting my feet in very cool water. It was much worse at night. I used 'Litacain' numbing cream (left over from when I had a port) on the red areas on the sides and bottom of my feet and I could go back to sleep. Saved my sanity. Please ask your Doctor for this if you get the bad burning/itching on your hands or feet. I only used it at night because I didn't want to walk on numb feet. Also, consider  putting your feet on an ice pack while having the infusion. Can't hurt and may help to avoid the hand/foot rash/peeling/blisters and keep you on Doxil. I have quit the Doxil because of the lack of mobility, but I am glad it shrunk my tumors and would still be on it if not for the feet. ",4
"2010 stage III ovarian cancer.  First chemo was taxoil & carbon  Had complete hair loss and medium nauseousness.  8 months remission.  Second round, same drugs with Avastin added.  Could not tolerate Avastin.  6 months later, Ca125 began to elevate.  Just finished my third infusion of Carbo and Doxil.  No hair loss, mild nauseousness.  Ca125 was 1040 now after two treatments, was 640.  CT scan shows tumors starting to shrink.  If this progress keeps up and I have no side effects from the Doxil, I will be very happy.   Have hope, faith and keep in God's word.",4

"Diagnosed Sept. 2010.Had 6 treatments with Carboplatin/taxol or taxatear. Remission for 6months. Tried Carboplatin/Gemzar for 3treatments but stopped due to harshness on bone marrow but remission lasted another 6 months. Carboplatin/Doxil sent CA 125 to 6 after 1 treatment, after 6 treatments still at 6 but CT scan showed tumors 70-75 percent gone so chose to continue for 3 more treatments. Very little hair loss, no skin or mouth lesions, no discoloration of skin, just fatigue for10-14 days.",4
Violently ill could not continue with this med,1
having bad bad nausea but numbers still going up after third treatment,2
"After 2 doses of Doxil (given every 4 wks) we reduced the infusion by 20% to help with the mouth sores and skin rashes. We reduced the dose by another 10% for the 4th dose for the mouth sores & Hand/Foot syndrome.  The biggest mystery to me was the daily fevers up to 104 degrees.  Now that I realize they are chemo related & not infection, I just do my best to keep them low with aspirin and resisting getting too bundled up in blankets. Night sweats accompany the fevers.  I also have joint pain and weakness that parallels the fevers.  The higher the fever, the weaker I am and the more joint pain. The fever goes away, the joint pain/weakness go away. Movement also helps with the joint pain. So when I wake up I lay in bed and bend my knees and pump my ankles before getting up. Later, I walk or ride a stationary bike.  I use Orabase to help with the mouth sores to eat and then apply Triamcinolone paste at night to help heal them.  They aren't as bad now that the doses have been reduced.  My breast CA has resisted Adriamycin/Cytoxan, Taxol, and 5FU/Cytoxan/Methotrexate. It metastasized to my lung. After 3 infusions the masses haven't really changed... not the greatest, but it could be worse.  This breast CA might be a late effect of mantle radiation I received for Hodgkins disease back in 1979.  They don't radiate like that anymore.  Otherwise, doing fine. God bless you all and may you feel His presence and comfort!",3
Going to get my 8th treatment soon.  Very easy on the body. Easiest chemo so far.  Don't know what is in store drug wise after next treatment.,5
"my mother had carbo/taxol, recurrance in 5 months. started doxil/carbo.after second treatment numbers went down. had third treatment and is now in hospital with severe blisters in her mouth and all over face and in scalp. very, very weak just had to sleep all the time . can't eat. nausea, vomiting. fever of 103.2 . they are giving a lot of antibiotics, she has been in hospital 6 days, still not over this. no more doxil.",3
"Update: (1st reply was 3/2010) Finished six treatments doxil CA125 was 11, had ct scan no tumors. Drs. decided to keep me on doxil for maintaience, today CA125 is 11 (went as low as 10, still don't like when it goes up, even by 1 point)I do believe in this drug and find it very easy on body. Still have hair, brows and lashes! Prayers to All...",5
"i have had two rounds of doxil and my iga protiens have from 6k 3500..i dont have a pick line,for my treatment  this thursay morning...other one got infected..the nurses act like they are scared to death to give me one dose by iv this time..i cant get a port before thursday..as i am stil on antibiotics bcause of the infected line...any advice..should i put off this regiment until i can get the port line put in..is it just too dangerous to administer my iv as opposed to a port line",4
"diagnosed in 01/2009, hysterectomy, etc. Started w/carbo, taxol, re-mission only 3 months. Started doxil in Jan.2010, immediate results.CA125 had rose to 160, one dose of doxil put me @remission status again, CA125 keeps going down (I've had three tratments with three remaining), minor side effects,so far no hair loss, maybe SLIGHT loss of eyelashes/brow thinning, I also have heartburn after dose but only for a day or two.Fatigue is not as bad as with carbo.Also, no problems with hand/foot disease so far...May God bless all of you, and those dear angles, our caregivers....(47y.o. at time of diagnoses)",5
I have completed 12 cycles of doxil and have had excellent results with liveable side effects.  The lesions in my liver are smaller and no new ones have appeared.  The cancer in my bones has also stabalized.  I wish I could have had more cycles but my oncologist limited the amount I received because of the potential for heart problems.,5
"I have had 7 treatments of Doxil (7 months). CA 125 is rising around 9 or 10 every month. I have had a few side effects (fatigue, low white blood counts, hand-foot syndrome), but the one that I would like to see if anyone else has had, is in the second week (when my counts are actually at their highest due to Neulasta), I run a fever, then develop a cough and end up with Bronchitis (at least that's what the doctor diagnoses me with). I guess the thing that bugs me the most is what if I don't have an infection and take an antibiotic for nothing! The antibiotic always makes me feel better. I'm not feeling too good about the treatment I'm receiving, but oncologists seem to think it's effective.  ",3
so far so good on this drug. amalso talking avaston with it .        bon,4
"CA125 was 2000 when diagnosed in Oct.31,2008. took carboplatin and taxol for 8 treatments.  Had an allergic reaction to the carboplatin and also showed resistance to it. At that time my CA125 was at 64.  I have had 3 treatments of doxil and as of now(One year after diagnosis) My CA125 is 45.  Doxil is working.  I have had redness and paain in  my feet and haands buit nothing that put me down.  Other than that I have had no side effects.  Hope it ddoes the job",4
was on Doxil for 13 (months)treatments. Not working too well anymore.  New side effects cause chest discomfort,3
This treatment was completely ineffective against my grandmothers ovarian cancer. The treatment was very harsh and caused severe inflammation of the body. Ask your doctor many questions before starting this treatment. ,1
"1999-CA125=2700 and scans. Full hysterectomy and debulking.  Started with cisplatin/taxol, switched to carboplatin/taxol due to reaction.  After nine mos. 1st recurrence-started doxil with carboplatin.  Taken prophylatically every 7 weeks for 8 years.  In my 6th yr had a recurrence due to coming off Doxil for about a few months when I went on kidney dialysis due to original cisplatin and we wanted to give kidneys a rest. With recurrence, added carboplatin with doxil.  Now back on doxil only (lower dose) and today CA125 is 5.9. Muga scans are taken and I check in with a cardiologist. No heart  problems.   ",5
"I have metastatic Breast CA to liver and lung.  I have had a lot of prior Chemo drugs. This was fairly easy drug to tolerate. It is bringing down my CA2729 markers after 2nd treatment. No nausea, hair loss, bone pain, constipation or lose stools or low blood counts. It's also on a 4-week cycle instead of 3 for Breast CA patients. I do have to admit I do get heartburn the day of treatment thats treatable with OTC medications. Small drawback compared to some chemo drugs!",4
"I am the husband of an ovarian cancer patient and can tell you my wife's CA-125 started going down after two treatments (of a six month series) and now, the day before her fourth treatment,it continues to go down. She is experiencing very, very minimal side effects and we keep our fingers crossed, knock on wood, and pray to God that this medicine will take her to long, long term remission. Good luck to you all.",4
side effects a bad,1
"Face full of AK's and Bowens disease. Told to use efudex on full face. First week not too bad but then kicked in. Face was truely a mess of lesions and ulcers. Pain was incrediable. Worst I have experienced and was constant. Shaving new degree of pain. Pain so severe sent me into deprssion for 3 months. Healing slow but the results were excellent. My skin was smooth and clear.  Word of warning. Do not get this stuff on your genitals. I accidently did and the result was agonising pain for two weeks. If I had to do it again I would do it in sections, not all at once.",5
"Very important , before applying the cream to wash in warm salty water, it speeds the process up, scabs form and drop off faster- allow to dry before applying Efudix, don't towel dry allow to air dry, ",5
"I use Efudex (fluorouracil) regularly to treat precancerous melanoma lesions and sun damaged skin.  It is normal for this product to turn skin at treatment site very red or ruddy brown to red within the first two days of treatment; after that the red skin color dissipates, the skin returns to its natural color and pain, if any, ebbs away. I have used this on some pretty serious skin lesions, moles and bleeding melanoma freckles with great success; the abnormalities and lesions healed and disappeared within just a few days. My wife uses it on Age Spots, also with great success; the skin pigmentation dissipates and returns to normal (matching the surrounding skin) and and the age spot ceases to be visible to the naked eye.  I get the best use from this product when I apply it to my forehead and rub it into my scalp through my hair at the temples.  First time users should expect ruddy red skin coloration at treatment site and some pain (not much); skin color will return to normal in a few days and lesions will start to heal. Good Luck with this!

My skin specialist prescribed it for use TWICE A WEEK - with instructions to stop if the skin blisters in any way and then continue again once the skin heals. Repeat. I find this approach entirely bearable. ,4
"I used Efudex 2% cream in 2000 at age 35 to treat huge brown blotches on my face from sun damage.  It works by slowly burning off the discoloration over a 3-4 week time period, then it takes an additional 2-3 weeks for the burn to heal.  It's been seventeen years and the horrible blotches never came back.  Efudex is a wonderful treatment and I highly recommend it.  I was so impressed with the results of the medication that I kept the box as a reference in case I ever needed it in the future.  Today, an out of state friend was describing the same blotchiness on her face, so I pulled out the box and gave her the name of the cream.  I wasn't even sure if it was still being manufactured.  Now that I know it is, I plan on getting another prescription for the brown age spots on my hands and arms.  I don't recall experiencing any itchiness or other side affects some of the other people claim.  I do remember the medicine working miraculously, though.  I also remember that the blotches were so bad that cosmetics couldn't even cover it up.",5
"Applied twice daily for 2 week just as directed.  Took a few days to start seeing a color change in my face, and then for about 10 days it was tough-stinging, itching, and sudden irritable feelings on my face.  A thick coat of Vaseline was about the only relief.  Peeled for about another 7-10 days.  Have redness for about another 10 days.  It is about a 4-6 week process, but it ends with good results.",5
"Legs and arm treatment did not hurt just itch.Full chest area very painful,itchy,and burning sensation.This is second time in a year to use.Hoping the red spots will heal better.",5
"I'm near the end of a 30 day treatment period.  I've been treating my forehead, cheeks, nose and ears; the treatment is precautionary for precancer cells after having a squamous cancer removed from my ear lobe.  I've applied a thin coating twice a day after washing my face and waiting at least 10 minutes.  The first week to 10 days was barely noticeable.  Since then, all of the areas treated have shown increased signs of inflammation, particularly on my forehead.  There is some scabbing, and also some minor weeping.  The level of pain or irritation has been about 1.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  So, it looks like it would be painful, but other than some very minor (and very occasional) itching, it has not been uncomfortable.  My guess is that I did not have much sun damage; I did have several bad sunburns as a kid and young adult and only minor sunburns since then.",4
"I started on this to treat dry flaky skin on my nose and some patchy areas on my forehead and at the corner of my lip.  I had many reservations about starting this medication  (I'm a former cancer nurse) and I wish I'd listened to my gut.  The pain and burning was more than I could tolerate. I developed every side effect documented, poor sleep, emotional instability, constant bleeding from both nostrils, and a huge cold sore on my lip that is weeping and bleeding constantly. I have roseacia and my skin is worse now than prior to starting the Effudex.",1
"Two weeks of application on face and chest; first few days only red cheeks; by middle of second week face was entirely red as was chest and some spots on neck; then the crusty lesions developed on cheeks; very uncomfortable but tolerable with the right attitude.  Throw vanity to the wind; it looks hideous; lesions weep into pillow and face sticks to pillow as lesions pull away during the night. Most of this starts to happen during late in second week and for the next two weeks until all lesions are gone.  Side effects for me:  swelling of eyelids and lips during the night but subsided within an hour or so after I was up; extreme tightness of skin on face (use moisturizer as directed); two weeks after application lesions had all pulled/flaked away, and skin was red; very irritating sensation of stinging pinpricks on chest and then itching on chest (Benadryl cream helped this for me); developed excruciating itching in cleavage below treated chest area.  Try to keep a sense of humor, knowing that it is all temporary.  ",5
"Fourth or fifth treatment over the years.Effective earlier but I think I have become sensitized?? A little pain after the very first application. By third application was very red, crusting, weeping and painful. Symptoms eased within a day of no application. A year ago I applied to normal skin never exposed to sunlight and within three days developed red, raised, itching rash. Doesn't sound to me like normal reaction. Haven't found mention of sensitization in literature.",2
what can I use to take away the itch - the continual itch from Efudex?,5
"I have used bothe efudex and carat in the past ....this time, i started efudex on my nose on 1.14 evening, using 2x/day.....within 24 hrs, my face blistered and oozed, my nose throbbed, itchy and painful....had to stop on 1.18, used aquaphor and today 1.23 my face is completely healed....i hope it was able to do its job in just 4 days, but i could not stand the discomfort another minute",3
I've done an Efudex treatment 3 times on my face and once on my neck and arms. It's painful but really great results and worth the pain. Skin clears of the pre-cancerous lesions and looks better. Once I was able to use Carac which I only had to apply once/day.,5
I have used several times in the past.  Usually 2 weeks 2x day is sufficient.  When it starts to bleed stop! Scabs don't occur until you quit using the creme.  DO NOT get it on your eyelids or anywhere around eyes as this is extremely sensitive skin.  You will look like someone has hit you.  Good product and good luck.,4
"I am three weeks into treatment on my forehead and have now commenced using paw paw cream. I hope the final result is pleasing because the itchiness, burning and discomfort is almost unbearable. I am not sure if I had known about this beforehand, that I would have done the treatment and I would not be keen to do it again. I was not pre-warned about the degree of discomfort with this treatment.  ",4
"This is my second go around with Efudex. This time it is much more painful and the itching is driving me nuts. I use a CPAP for sleep apnea and my nose area is so raw I can hardly sleep. I am using the Efudex on my chest and face,and my chest is so painful it wakes me up if I try to roll over in my sleep. I am on day twelve of 14 days twice a day and I'm done. I can't finish,I itch/hurt so bad.",3
"I am on day 10 of 14 (twice a day). I started putting it on 4-5 small red marks on my face that weren't going away.  Since using this product, the redness is almost on my whole face!   I'm wondering if this cream spreads as I sleep and turn on my pillow.. I can see yellowish film on my pillowcase.....can't wait for it to end!",5
"The process is very painful.  I managed by using Noxema to wash my face.  I used tylenol for pain.  I used Aquafor and Cortisone treatment to help with healing once I stopped the application process.  If using this doesn't keep you out of the sun, nothing will",5
Once a day for 3 weeks I only made it to 2 1/2 weeks extremely painfull red scabs Tylenol not helpfully  used gold bond medicaled ointment for temporary relieve this was for keratosis on both arms I have used this for patches with no problem I am seeing the Dr tomorrowfor alternative TX I have had squamous cells surgically removed in the past I will never again go out in the sun uncovered horrible painfull treatment,3
"I am on my first day of stopping using effudex after a 30 day treatment on my upper lip, cheeks, nose and temple. Had burning, itching, bad swelling, weeping sores, and now have a very unsightly scabs on all areas. I have no doubt this will work for me, but wish I was better prepared for the pain. Advil didn't really help. Post treatment is Clorsig (an eye ointment for conjunctivitus in australia) which I have started today. Good luck to everyone who uses this on their face. Be prepared to stay out of the sun, and maybe have time off work.",4
"This is my 3rd round with this treatment on my lips. I was to use for 14 days on day 8 had to stop and seek meds for the pain. My problem is getting the raw and scabs to heal. I have tried Aquaphor,Vaseline and Triple Antibotic but no relief. The med works well no doubt and I would recommend this to someone needed it. In the past my lips looked great but it keeps coming back to at my age, this is the last go round. My suggestion to anyone using this, cold compresses as the sores start. Good Luck and overall this product works, you just have to find a way to deal with some of the side effects.",4
"I'm on day 10 of a three week treatment on my face and back of neck. I have been following instructions carefully and today is the first day I have felt any pain whatsoever. Abnormal cells are prominently rising to the surface of my skin now, highly visible. One suggestion, if you do not use gloves to apply, be sure to wash hands twice. So far, so good, but based on posts I'm reading here, I may not be so calm in another week or so.",4
"I have been using Efudex for the first time and have applied it for one week.  So far, absolutely no change in the appearance of my skin whatsoever.  Am using the prescribed dosage.  I know that it takes time before any change is noticed, but since not a single change is appearing after 7 days, I am wondering if it is working.  ",3
"I have used Efudex topical cream in the past on my chest with very good results. It does take time, looks horrible & is somewhat painful, but final results are good. However, this time I used it on a basal cell that popped up on my left temple near my ear. My dermatologist suggested using it for 3 wks. 2x a day. My skin has erupted into severe redness from above my eye down to the bottom of my ear, burns, itches & stings. Much larger area than the one spot I found. Called my doctor & he prescribed hydrocortisone valerate cream 0.2% 3 days ago. I am 4 days away from the 3 wk. deadline & found that in the past 3 days I have had extreme reactions...irritability, nervousness, swollen lips, insomnia. Then yesterday I broke out with huge hives above the opposite temple & began having trouble breathing, felt extreme nervousness internally. By evening my air passages felt blocked & hives worse. I immediately took a Benadryl, washed the infected area & applied the hydrocortisone. I Googled the side effects for Efudex & all of these symptoms were mentioned. I am going to call my doctor today, but I feel because it is at my mucous membrane area, this drug caused more of a reaction. I am stopping it all together & hope that the basal cell is gone. If not I will have a biopsy & have it burned off before I would use this cream again facially. Strong stuff!! Having been an outdoor person when I was younger & fair skinned, I am now paying for it. I have had Moh's surgery 4x now. Not good.",4
"I am on day 11. Reading all of the reviews has me worried about the second half of my treatment.  I had melanoma surgery under my eye in July and often have precancerous patches frozen on my face, so this 21 day treatment was recommended as a preventative measure.  As of today, my forehead is covered with tiny red dots. The creases of my nose look sunburned. A red dot on each cheek. But, my chin looks like I took a torch to it. I was told that it only affects precancerous cells, so I am hopeful that I have quite a bit of healthy skin, as most of my face doesn't seem affected. At least, not yet (day 11). But, we will see. Overall, my face feels sunburned and chin burns a bit more. But tolerable so far. I am 55 and spent way too much time in the sun throughout my life. Sunscreen and hats for me from now on!",4
Have been using med for 5 days on face and neck. red scabby areas have appeared all over my face and neck. I can only hope that this condition begins fading soon.,3
"Have used efudex many times over the years. Using now on forehead. After three weeks results are showing however I am experiencing some emotional discomfort, which is noted in product literature. Have applied good quality calming skin lotion to  affected areas and mental disposition has improved. Don't be alarmed if you experience emotional problems or insomnia with use of Efudex. ",4
"This medicine is very uncomfortable to use. The burning, itching and dryness of the area being treated is annoying. It feels like having the area is on fire at times. And the treated area is very red with scabs forming and gets very unsightly for several weeks after treatment. I would almost prefer having the pre-cancer cells frozen instead of going through this treatment. At least the pain only lasts for a few minutes and then it's gone.",5
I have used this medication a couple of times with good results.,5
"This is my 2nd time to use Efudex.  The first time I used Aldara and was so horribly sick from that.  Next time my dermatologist prescribed the Efudex.  No side effects.  You have to expect the area to get red, crusty and have a scab, that's how it works, but the results are so worth it!  Also, you may start using it on just one spot, but as usage continues other little spots in the area will pop up that you will have to treat also.  It only turn the skin red and inflamed where it is applied.  ",5
"I am using Carac for the third time in 6 years.  I have red spots on various parts of my face after 14 days of use, 1X per day. I had hard spots  (karatosis) before use, but many more places turned red now. I just had a basal cell carcinoma cut off my jaw line last July and this treatment is definately preferable to that.  It burns a little, and seems kind of itchy but not anything that prevents my normal daily activities.  It makes your skin feel kind of dry too. My doctor said to use it for 14 days but I missed two days so I will extend the application for 2-3 more days.  ",4
"I have just finished 22 days of treatment on my arms.  Lots of red splotches but no real pain or discomfort.  No one has commented  on the splotches, but I have worn long sleeves most of the time.  now that the treatment is over, I am curious to see how long it takes for the red splotches to heal. ",5
"Red headed male, 83 yrs.  Third treatment , first on chest, in about twelve years. Last time on arms I swore never again, this time I mean it. Had to stop treatment after twelve days. Chest became extremely raw and painful.  Chest now healed but continues to ich at different times of day. Peculiar side effect is that three weeks after ceasing treatment I continue to have severe outbreaks of hives or simply intense itching over different parts of body including far from treated areas. Sometimes legs, other times arms or back, buttocks, and neck. Only ice packs seem to help. Itching ceases after 20-30 minutes and then resumes elsewhere a few hours later. Another peculiar effect is keratosis like patches erupting on back (never treated) and on previously treated arms.",5
"2ND time on my face and its no fun it burns, itches, weaps, bleeds, scabs and people look at you like you have the plague. Hang in there baby it looks good when it heals but its no fun until then.",5
This drug was extremely effective on my facial actinic keratosis; I looked like a lobster for about 10 days but it was worth it; after 2 weeks my face looked 100% better,5
"This is my second course of treatment with efudex.  My first was about four years ago, and two years ago I used Levulan which is a photodynamic therapy method for certain skin conditions.  My experience with the efudex has been very positive.  I did experience some discomfort in the final few days of application and was given a prescription for a small dose of hydrocodone which helped tremendously.  I also have had some discomfort using my CPAP machine.  The redness and inflammation from the efudex don't lend themselves to the straps of the  CPAP mask (I wasn't diagnosed with sleep apnea until the last year).  However, I have had six basil cell carcinomas removed over the course of the last 10 years and while this is more painful, I don't need to be cut on if I can help it.  I also recommend that this be done in the late fall or winter.  The cooler weather made it more tolerable for me. I would like to know from the posters on this site whether the effects are not as severe with each subsequent course of treatment.",5
I have used Efudex three times in six years and the results are incredible.  3-4 weeks of not such nice looking skin is worth the results.,5
"I had an ugly growth on my left lower eyelid that had continued to get larger over the last 6-7 years.  My doctor had tried freezing it off by dipping a cotton swab in liquid nitrogen but that procedure had no effect. I had used Efudex before on my face and the top of my head with good success. I asked the doctor about using it to see if it would remove the growth on my eyelid. The doctor told me it I did that I would have to be very careful and suggested that perhaps I could try using a small cotton tip to apply.  I actually used the small stick portion of the cotton tip to apply and I was VERY careful.  Amazingly, the ugly growth simply peeled off and is COMPETELY gone with zero damage to my eye. The doctor was both pleased and somewhat surprised at the success.",5
"I am in my 3rd week of applying this horrible cream to my arms and chest. I look like I have a horrible skin disease. Open sores, rashes, itching, burning and my skin feels like it could split open. I am unable to sleep. The thought of applying the cream even one more time makes me shudder.",3
Not very effective in my case of Bowen disease,2
"My doctor said I would get small scabs after 1 week and then they would fall off. No problem. Easy. She didn't say I would have terrible pain, itchy skin (with a felling like I wanted to rip it off!), and it's day 17 and I fell horrible! I look horrible, and the scabs still haven;t formed, let alone fallen off. I didn't have any noticeable skin cancer. I was just a person who wnet in the sun as a kid and she suggested a do this as a preventative measure. I suppose if you have a skin cancer diagnosis, the terrible pain would be worth it. But, as a preventative measure...NEVER! Searching the internet, which I should have done beforehand, I see this could last 2 months!!!! Yikes! It is VERY PAINFUL! ",5
"I am on 4 week, day 3.  I am using on my forehead and head, mostly in balding areas.  This is my 3rd go around.  I used it in a small are in 1993 and in a larger area in 2004. I look hidious.  My leasioins have just erupted into welts and scabs.  I know the process and understand that this is good for it means I am at the end of the process.  I will apply the creme until Monday and move into healing and regrowth phase.",5
"This medication should not be given to cardiomyopathy patients. I had scaring in my heart from a flu virus that had infected my heart in '98. I had spent 10 years rebuilding my heart as much as possible.   Then I took Efudex for precancerous skin cells on the face. About six days into treatment I had angina that landed me in the ICU.  I stopped the Efudex and recovered, but they could find nothing unusual to give me angina.  Then when my husband used it a couple years later and I unwittingly touched his treatment area three days in a row it really messed my heart up.  I felt like I was dying and so weak I just laid in bed and prayed.  They said it couldn't be my heart but I've had two sudden deaths since a few months apart.  The latest CAT scan shows my heart is miraculously completely healed!  I am wondering if this drug destroyed the scar cells in my heart and made it recover.  Maybe it was for the best, but I felt like I was surely going to die the second time round. I hope someone does some research on this.",3
"Used it 2 times a day for 8 days as could not bear the pain.  I experienced flu like symtoms, headache,intense burning, no sleep, swelling, excoriation to face and chest.  Was not given any warning of what to expect or how to deal with all the ramifications.  3 weeks later I am albino looking with a leather like chest.  My face is bright red but no longer painful.  Cannot tell you how terrible this experience was and I am not a baby by any means so know what you are possibly headed into and think hard about it.    Would never recommend this to anyone without trying a test patch as I reacted very seriously or so I am told by my doctor. I recommend intense  consideration before doing this",1
"Have been on treatment for arms 1 month - very little pain and working well.  On face - in third week of treatment and not sure I can continue.  The pain and burning is almost too much.  Everyday gets worse, but don't want to stop the healing.  Feels like there are millions of ants crawling and biting my skin. Have not really slept in 4 days and thats bad also. Still trying to hang in there.",5
"I took this treatment during a recuperation for an unrelated surgical procedure, knowing I would be confined to my home. I used the medicine for facial redness due to sun exposure over the years. After 10 days, I discontinued the medication, one because my doctor advised me to but also because I could barely stand one more day of discomfort, especially around my lips. Recovery was pretty quick though, and after my skin looked fabulous. I had old friends at a reunion go on and on about how great my skin looked. They did not know I had this treatment.  ",5
"I'm a first time user. I have precancerous cells in my lower lip, and my doctor prescribed Fluorouracil 5% once a day (before bed). I didn't notice any change for the first 3-4 days. But, soon my lip turned became raw and painful. I didn't listen to the doctor who told me to stay out of the sun. By day 7 I had a very swollen lip, bloody sores, & lots of pain, especially on the corners of my mouth. I stopped using the topical cream for three days, and now my lower lip is scabby and bleeds. I used a thin coat of the cream yesterday night. I will visit the dermatologist in three days.    The hardest part of using the cream on a lip is not accidentally swallowing it,which I haven't done to my knowledge. I use a cu tip to apply it to the lip. I also wash my hands if I get any cream on them. I am patiently waiting for this to end and the pain to stop, although I do sleep well and can for the most part, ignore the pain.   ",4
had a very severe reaction and spreading of the inflamation was extensive,5
"I have used this two previous times on my face on a small spot and had no trouble except I had to stop before three weeks because of the inflammation.  This time I'm using it on my chest in a larger area and have had a big reaction, having oozing spots in less than two weeks, so stopped using as the doctor said to do so.  Very red and painful. I'm now using an antibiotic cream to help with the healing.  I still have some area to do but will wait until this has healed.  Was very satisfied with results on my face.  Don't know about the chest yet.",5
"This is my second time using this product. The first time was on my forehead where I had patches of damaged skin. The healing process was rather quick after completion of my 4th week about a year ago.  I have just completed my 4th week on my hands and arms. As I continued the process, there was more sun damage than I first realized. There is a tremendous amount of redness with scabs forming over the affected areas. Don't be discouraged by the effects of the product. It works very well, and it left my forehead as smooth as a babys. Still waiting for the final results on hands and arms. But the scabs begin coming off almost immediatly after completion of the treatment. Some redness continues, but remember the affected areas were damaged and patience is required before you realize the final results. Don't give up or worry about what people see. Just explain to them what you are doing as I have done with my coworkers and friends. I just laugh and tell them that soon I'll have the skin of a teenager. And I'm 54. However I avoid the sun as much as possible where as I used to do just the opposite.",5
"was supposed to use 1x a day,for 2 weeks.on day 7 the pain and itching was so bad,I had to quit. Its 3 weeks later,and my skin has gotten less red,but dont see much improvement.Also,have had hives for the last 2 weeks..not at the areas the cream was,so dont know if its related.",3
"I have finished my 2 weeks of efudex applications of twice a day and as everyone mentions, there is now lots of redness, soreness and swelling on my face.  Has anyone used neosporin with pain reliever  on your fact to help with the healing and pain once you have finished with your two weeks of applying the efudex?  I would love to try that to see if it helps clear up my face quicker.",5
"I'm on my 4th round in 11 years.  Was told 1st time to use it 2x day on face as long as I could.  After 15 days, I looked like I had a terrible sunburn & bleeding.  2 weeks of healing & I had baby's butt skin on my face & best shave ever.  Highly recommend it.    ",5
Minimal reaction to the ointment but not as much improvement in skin as I expected.Overall a noticeable improvement in skin eruptions.,4
1st time using doesn't burn that bad or itch that bad minor burning when put on w/o taking shower first .i have copd & have had hodjkins lymphoma (in remission now 2 years)also have rheutamoid arthritis +osteoarthritis seems like i'm having trouble (at times ) with shortness of breath don't know if this is copd or the efudex  have to contact doctor,4
"I was to apply Efudex twice per day for 14 days. Stinging, itching and burning were unbearable. My doctor would not treat the pain but had me stop after 12 days. Ice packs helped a little but vasoline felt like acid. My family MD finally prescribed pain meds and after 24 hours I felt better. I have not seen pain meds mentioned on any site. I essentially had second degree burns over my entire face. Am I super sensitive or have others had the same problems?",4
"2nd time in 8 yrs. 1st time dr. exp. with retin A, at same time. Should have stopped @ 4 weeks, went 6. Pain, off the the charts. Swelling,uzing and down right scary to look at . Half bald, top of head, neck ears, face and arms.Got the treatment twice a day. After I stopped @ doc. advice soaked in hot bath tub for a very long time and very gently rubbed off all dead and damaged skin. HAD to cover all new skin with a/d ointment or pain was. Did the ointment for over a week plus.  Retin A was the major cause of pain. No one should use the two together. Keep out of the sun when useing and afterwards.Yeah right ! So for most of you out there use a very high sun blocker. My Dad died of skin cancer. Just thought you should know. ",5
I started using 2X/day and only got to day 6 with pain and swelling on my chest.  I wasn't informed of the discomfort I would have.  I didn't know if I was having an allergic reaction or if this was what it was supposed to do.  Went to Dr. to find out it was working as it should.  Dr. said I could discontinue because of the pain and try it later on in smaller doses (amt. of days continually using).  I'm not getting any sleep and it's very painful.,3
"Did not wash hands every time, had some jock itch and you would not believe what is going on down there.  pain and more, i now half to seek medical help.",5
I cannot properly rate the effectiveness or satisfaction of Efudex.  This is my second day of applying it on my lips.  I see no effect or other irrratation on my lips at this time.  I have been advised by my dermatologist to use it only for one week.,1
"This is my second time using, primarily on my face. Efudex is easy to use but the pain both times has been intense, especially this second time. Itching and burning especially on the bridge of my nose and to a lesser extent at the corners. Nothing seems to lessen this pain for me except knowing it won't last forever.",4
"I grew up in the 50's & 60's in So CA.  when slathering Johnsons Baby Oil all over you was the thing to use when sunbathing.  You weren't in if you didn't go back to school TAN!!!  Of course now I'm seeing the results of those stupid decisions but who knew??  Now at this point in my lfe I am being treated for actinic keratosis.  I'm just beginning my third week of treatment. I've noticed my lower lip swelling and peeling even though I'm not treating it. It must be seeping onto it. I've noticed some ""not feeeling 100%"" and also some depression with it.  I'm tired of explaining to people what it is. I look and feel awful.  It seems to be getting worse as the weeks go on. The burning is getting to me.  I'll try the warm towels and letting it dry really good before appying.  See if that works...  ",5
"This is my 2nd stint with Efudex. And my 1st time on my face, temples and cheek areas. High inflamation, itching and sensitivity-relieved only by warm towel applications and followed by thin film of petroleum jelly.  Difficulty having sound sleep. Currently in 3rd week of application. ",5
"Applied 2x day for 4 weeks to left arm, then took 2 weeks off before using 2x day on right arm.  I was to supposed to also use on back (next), but will wait until winter to do that. First week--thought this was no big deal; then it started showing.  Tightness started hurting that week.  Third week was more painful and 4th week was bad enough my Dr. said I'd had a ""good"" (thorough) reaction and let me quit a few days early.  Took two weeks of healing to get my nerve up for next arm.  Looked less intense than my driving arm, but seemed to hurt more and heal more slowly.  Wasn't as solid but seemed to be deeper.  First arm is looking really good, and despite the pain I'd certainly do it over--not nearly as messy as the nitrogen burning and the end result is worth the pain.  Dr. gave me some steroid cream to use at the end of the second arm and that really helped.  It really does affect only the bad cells, because I was very thorough and the underside of my arms had almost no bad cells, but upper arms by shoulder were almost solid (and I was not avid ""sun worshipper"").  This has made me a walking advertisement for sunscreen. ",4
"It's hard to know when you are too close to your eyes.  I have red burning skin around my eyes and in the creases beside my nose.  How do you know if it's doing the right thing, or if it's an alergic reacion?  It hurts!",3
"One strange effect: I applied efudex to my forehead where I had several scaly skin growths. None of them responded but an untreated area on the back of my ear-lobe responded strongly. Furthermore, sinc the treatment I have become aware of a growth on my Thyroid. Is this a psooible side effect? ",4
"had to put on upper chest for four weeks twice a day.  After three weeks took week off and then finished with another week.  My skin hurt, burned and itched.  It was awful.  When I had tshirts on the seeping of the skin and blood soaked through.  It was awful and very painful.  I have no idea how people who have to put it on their faces can stand ot/",1
"This was an intravaginal application for HPV induced lesion.  This was a once a week, 10 week series.  So far so good.  I will find out this month if the lesion is gone.  Over all, not difficult.  First week was rough.Burning and irritation .Protect outside important.",4
Have not used long enough to form opinion.,3
"I'm on my 3rd X facial use of this over the past 8 years.  Now I only have to use it on areas that show possible pre-cancerous condition.  It does get painful, but well worth working through the pain.  Better than getting cut for removal and scarring",5
"This is my second 3-week stint on Efudex, first time was about 10 years ago. Using it on face and chest area. As expected, it caused inflammation and weeping of the cancerous areas, but after about 2 weeks post-treatment, fresh skin emerged with no scarring or discoloration. Hopefully my derm will give me the all-clear; appt is next week.",4
"A bit uncomfortable during the end weeks of usage.  You will get a few stares from people who do not know you.  I recommend that you use only duing the winter and late fall months.  Heat makes the condition a lot more uncomfortable.  The healing process is a bit slow, but the end result is well worth it.  At 48 completing the process will help off set many further complications down the line.  Good luck and keep your spirts up.",5
DIZZY AND UPSET STOMACK GETTING SINK,3
Have finished the treatment. Some redness present after one week following last application. Used 2x/day for 3 weeks. Very little discomfort.,5
"While the product is very effective, its use, esp. around the face, can be very painfull after several days of applications.",5
"(1) Very important instruction... I learned the hard way: Wait at least 10 minutes (20-30 even better) after washing applicable area.  Water increases the rate of absorption. (2) the nose, and the area on each side of the nose and mouth absorb higher rates of Efudex, and may become hyper-sensitive, so it's best to apply less to these areas.  This is my third time on Efudex in the last 7 years.  Other times were 7 years ago and 5 years ago.",4
"After results from a 35.6 PSA, which had risen from 3.1 in 18 months, and a Gleason score of 10, I received 45 EBRT and have been on Eligard for 11 months, currently on 4th shot. Latest PSA resulted in 0.78 and I'm projected to be on Eligard for ""at least 2 years. Hot flashes are regular day and night with some joint pain, leg cramps, fatigue and all loss of sex drive. Considering my cancer was not found outside the Prostate, I feel lucky and the side effects are tolerable when considering what could have been a spread through out my body. I will be monitored by my Oncologist for an additional 5 years. My age is 78.",5
"Diagnosed with Gleason 10 in 2014.  44 days EBRT and 2 years of qtly eligard shots.  Side effects are ED, hot flashes, more periodic urination and hand (small joint) pain.  Dr. recommended low dose magistral acetate for hot flashes. Worked wonders. Have been off eligard for 6 months now.  Still dealing with some hot flashes, ED and small joint pain.  Hoping the next 12 months will improve.",4
Lowered my PSA to 0.04 prior to radiation treatments. The burning in my feet and legs is really bad. It's been 16 months since I had the one injection and the burning in my feet etc. is still there and constant. I'm now taking drugs for neuropathy. My PSA is still below 1.0 so the cancer part is fine but 0.0 on any sexual activity is bad. I have to wonder if the radiation would have been sufficient without the side effects of this drug to deal with? No sign the side effect are going to let up and its been 16 months. ,4
used with radiation treatment in 2011-psa dropped from 17.5 to .25/cancer returned this year-rose from .50 to 4.95 in 6 months and actually tripled psa in last 4 wks took eligard again and very fatigued and have little interest in doing anything-better than alternave-right side of the grass! ,3
"I had a Gleason #9 and radical surgery with cancer cells in several lymph glands after surgery. Had my first injection after about 3 years. Since then I had averaged 12-14 months between injections with PSA never over 1.0. Going on 12th year and have had 6 injections, the last was 14 months ago.   ",5
"Since I started taking this medicine I now have problems with tasting all foods, liquids and a constant bad taste in my mouth.  I mention this condition to my dentist and told him I was taken Eligard, he said right away that this is from the Eligard.This medicine has caused my salvia glands to become hyper active which has resulted in excessive amount of salvia and me having to constantly spit. The salvia is sometimes like mucus which can cause fungus to develop on the tongue.My dentist advice is to brush my teeth regularly and to clean my tongue to keep fungus from forming. ",3
"psa 8.6, had 45 days of radiation. first shot lupron only hot flashes and being tired. Elligard hot flashes, very tired, and tingling in foot, joint pain and hand swelling. Psa 0 , after 4 months will ask for lupron.",5
"Received 6 mos subq injection combined with 44 radiation treatments (Gleason 6 and 7 - PSA 13.6).  After 44 radiation treatments, PSA dropped to .3,  Two months after treatment, PSA is .11.  I guess it will be awhile before I know if the low PSA is due to the Eligard or the radiation.  Worst (maybe only) side effect has been hot flashes, 8 to 12 per day, usually after 7 PM and middle of night.  Difficult to sleep through the night because of waking up to a drenching sweat.  Flashes usually only last a few minutes but discomfort remains for about 10 minutes until perspiration evaporates.  Doctor wanted to keep me on Eligard for 6 more months but I talked him into waiting 6 months to see if my PSA stays low.  I hate,and I mean HATE the hot flashes.  7 months since the beginning of Eligard treatment and the flashes continue  ",5
"Lots of hot flashes, day and night.  When a hot flash is coming on I feel uncomfortable and a light pain sensation in feet and legs. Mood swings and depression. These problems are far better than the alternitive",4
This drug helped my cancer but it had two significant side effects. One it made me grow female breasts and made my hair grow on the top of my head where hair had gone away long ago. Is there a part of this drug that can be used for hair growth??? Please respond. [email protected],5
"My prostate, some lymphnodes, and tissue were removed due to a highly active form of prostate cancer.  However, that did not stop the ever increasing PSA blood levels, neither did radiation treatment.  Eligard did stop the PSA increase, but all sexual desire & activity for me has ended. ",4
"Since Eligard, I have no desire to make love to my beautiful wife who I love dearly. I miss her and the closeness we felt. I am depressed, urinate more frequently and have become emaciated since ELigard.",5
Within seconds after receiving my first injection of Eligard I experienced an intnese burning sensation at the injection site that did not begin to subside for more than ten minutes.  Therefore I demanded that subsequent injections be preceded by a local anithsetic injection at the injection site.  Even with preceding injections of lydacaine the subsequent injections were somewhat painful.,5
Noticeable loss of energy....   ,5
"I have been injecting Leuprolide for a little over 2 weeks now.  The only side affects that I have experienced are diareah, hot flashes and some mood swings.  I have lost a little weight, though I am not sure if it has anything to do with the medication.  The medicine is easy to inject and doesnt hurt one bit.  ",4
"I am a 75 year old male. I have had good results with these shots. I have had 3 shots so far and they have brought my PSA down from 5.7 to .20. I have a slight breast enlargements, but other than that, no side effects. I am very satisfied with the treatments. They are administered in the doctors office.",5
My mood swings are horrific and I get migraines after being on it a week.,5
Care giver for relative who was destroyed by this drug. Everyone needs to Google  lupronvictimshub and see the information,1
"I have been doing injections of lupron every four weeks for almost six months now.  For treatment of endometriosis.  I got extremely sick for the first week, I could not keep even the smallest amount of food down.  I literally was walking around with a bucket..not so much walking, I was exhausted.  After about the first week I had zero pain, zero!  I don't think I had any idea how difficult these treatments would be.  I am, if i may say so, an extremely kind and gentle person by nature.  Since my treatments I am extremely volatile.  Irritated by the smallest of things.  I am extremely emotional and extremely tired.  oh and hungry..very strong cravings.  The hot flashes are awful but not as bad as the night sweats.  Your tired all day and then the night sweats keep you from getting a good night sleep.  If I could give any advice it would be to get a bucket and a reusable water bottle for water (ice, ice, ice)  for next to your bed.  I shared all of this because I wish someone had shared it with me..so hopefully I helped and you won't feel so crazy like i did.  What it comes down to is, it works, it sucks but it works.  so good luck to you.",5
I've been using Lupron since June 07 and other than hot flashes and slight breast enlargement I have not encountered any other problems.  My psa dropped from .59 to .08 in three months.,4
"I had to stop the injections  because of serious mood swings, and depression. I'm a 57 year old man and began picking fights with men much younger than me, including a 30 year old professional boxer. I don't know for sure what my next option is but it won't be lupron. ",2
"Eloxatin IV may have save your life and then ruin it. It can cause neuropathy. Neuropathy can effect the peripheral nerves.  Sometimes the neuropathy can go away and sometimes last forever.   I was given it as part of chemo.  Now my toes and fingers seem to have pins and needles and are numb.  My small toe is red and swollen.   This is nothing compared to how bad Eloxatin induced neuropathy can be. It can be extremely painful. It can also be debilitating to the point of crippling your body functions.   It might help you survive cancer.  In some fairly rare cases, it may make you wish you hadn’t survived. When I complained about the side effects of chemo drugs, the doctor asked,”Would you rather die?” Many people survive the cancer and the chemo and some have no after effects.  Be aware that it is a gamble and don’t do it or accept the gamble and the consequences",3
"Resulted in long =term peripheral neuropathy.  Even now am 5 yrs out and considered ' cured'' have to take fentenyl patche sand oxycodone for pain in back, abd., legs. Aching, unrelenting pain.

"I have been very thankful that this drug has been a part of the regimen to sustain my life. Although no significant change has occured in the cancer, it has kept the progression at bay. Even so.. It is difficult to deal with the weakness and lathargic reactionaries from it's use. I would like to see more information on the long term use and effects of this medication.",3
"had 12 rounds of chemo, 10 with Oakiplaitin. The cold sensitivity was bad, as was the neuropathy in my hands and feet. I finished chemo in September 2018, and the cold sensitivity is gone, and the neuropathy  is getting better. Hang in there!!!",5
"I know this drug will help me be free of colon cancer but at the same time it is very hard on me. I am sick immediately after getting off the pump on chemo days and the neuropathy it causes in my hands and mouth is sometimes difficult to handle. it makes my mouth dry, food taste funny and my mouth and lips tingle.",4
"I have not had severe side effects while on this drug.  My fingers and toes tingle when they get cold, but it goes away very quickly.  If the tingling is very bad, I rinse them in warm/hot water and it goes away.",5
My only complaint is the numbness remaining in my hands and feetl,5
"I'm satified with the performance of this drug which was part of a FOLFOX cocktail for Stage IIIb Colon Cancer. The only thing I'm not happy about is the peripheral neuropathy. Not being able to feel your fingers, toes, and soles of your feet is not fun. It has been 6 months since my last treatment. We'll see what happens next.",5
My nurse overdosed me by infusing me over 2 hours instead the orders for 4 hours. I have horrible pain in my fingers and feet.I can't open bottles or jars. I don't know if this side effect is worth it. You can't do everyday things with the neuropathy. ,2
"While the oxaliplatin staved the cancer away, it did cause ocular dysfunction.",5
"My husband (like others i have read) has developed neuropathy. He says that had he known the severness of not feeling of fingers and toes and the pain of hands and feet he would not have used the drug, however if it works then it saved his life, but he argues ""at what expense?"" He is in constent pain, severe enough that he crys at times, feels he has no quality of life.",4
Terrible neuropathy and nausea for many days after the treatment. The numbness is increasing and spreading to my feet and legs. I experience sensitivity to cold and exhaustion for about 7 days after the treatment.

I have had peripheral neuropathy the longer I have been on it.  It was stopped when I could no longer feel my feet when walking or driving. Now my tips of fingers have also got it bad.  We'lll see how the dr. addresses this issue today when I go for my visit.  My cancer marker has gone from over a thousand to eleven in the last 6 months.  Worth putting up with it as long as I can walk & feel some....,5
badside effects while on the drug. Long term side effect of neuropathy is pretty bad to deal with.   ,3
The oncologist decided on this Tx in taking an aggressive stand for early stage colon cancer.The only side effects have been extreme fatigue and moderate nausea.The cancer is now in remission after 6 weeks and will review in another 2 weeks.Very satisfied with results so far.,5
"In Feb. 2008 I was dx with stage iv espohageal cancer and given little hope even told by first oncologist not todo anything and accept my fate. I was determined to fight and was given this, avastin and xeloda. I had terrible side effects with this and had to stop after 3 months but my tumors also disappeared. I continued with the avastin an additional 5 months and xeloda for almost a year. As of today I have had the esophagus removed and am able to swallow and eat (just in smaller Portions) My experience has been eye opening and everybody has a different metabolism so just because it did not work for one person does not mean it may not work for you. If you want to fight, fight Do not be swayed in your convictions and keep positive. Doctors do not know everything they just look at the Playbook and do what others have done in the past. Look for someone who has faith in you and wants to work with you. I am still here 2 years after being dx with stage iv. Also look at your diet look into alkaline water and asparagus. Think positive.",4

I've learned how to live with it:  dress warm, avoid cold and don't forget those gloves!  As long as the drug works I can live with the discomfort.

After combined with Zolfram my vomiting stopped and nausea dropped significantly as beforehand Zolfram itself was only partially effective with delayed nausea and vomiting,5
An expensice med but WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  I expereienced absolutely no nausea and did not vomit once during my entire 6 month ciurse of treatment.,5
Have not had any side affects at all since taking it.,5
"sorry i am going to take it tomorrow,i don,t know the effect yet.",4
I used this medication for help with nausea for chemo for colon cancer.  I also used it prior to the surgery to remove the tumor since being put to sleep always made me sick.  I did not get sick at all after surgery and it made the chemo tolerable.  The nausea was one of my minor side effects.,5
My husband had his first round of chemo today for bladder cancer. It was Cisplatin/Gemzar. Th Emend worked great. No nausea at all.,5
"I am a 1 yr breast cancer survivor. I definitely recommend Emend. I would ususally have my treatment on Wed, go to work on Thu and rest on Fri,Sat,Sun and return to work on Mon.  I could not have done that without Emend.  I never had any nausea or vomiting episode. I had the Zofran as a backup but never used it.",5
I am very satisfied with Emend.  It has given me total relief from nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy for rectal cancer.,5
Nothing short of a miracle! I have had several surgeries because of two mastectomies and breast reconstruction. I literally would throw up for hours because of the anesthesia despite Zofran and other meds. I took Emend on my last surgery and for the very first time I only had a wave of nausea that the Zofran took care of. ,4
Thank God that you have produced this drug,5
I had my first adriamycin/cytoxan chemo treatment yesterday. I was given Emend shortly before my infusion and took another one when I got up this morning.  Other than VERY mild queezy feelings every now and then ... Emend is working wonderfully!!,4
When he had his first chemo he was so sick the next day after he came home from hspital he could not go to radation I found out that he did not get his emend.  The second chemo I took charge of his meds and refused to give them to hspital it made all the difference in the world.  No sickness the home health nurse who dropped off the IV fluids even noticed the difference.  Emend made my job so much easier it is hard enough on him dealing with cancer it makes it worse if he is sick.  Thank the makers of emend not only did you help him you helped me.,5
"This medication worked wonders for me (breast cancer) currently undergoing chemo treatments, have 1 chemo treatment left to go & I wouldn't do it w/o taking my emend pills as prescribed, as expensive as they were through my work insurance company ($40-co-pay), but worth every cent. ",5
"I was switched to Emend after my chemo regimen was changed mid-treatment (prior was using Zofran for anti-nausea). Emend seems very effective compared to the medications that target the stomach, rather than the brain.",5
"I just finished my 2nd round of chemo (breast cancer) and the 3rd and final Emend of this round. Two rounds to go yet. It must be really working well (no nausea, etc.)because I still have the back-up of Zofran (which gave me a headache) and Ativan (haven't needed that one either).  I have no complaints.  About other things, yes, but I can't pin anything on Emend, that's for sure!  Other good things I found are the Weight Watchers yogurt with prebiiotics and probiotics, and Gatorade.",5
This drug caused the worst life experience I have ever incurred. I wound up in the hospital for 4 days on day 7 of my chemo due to severely difficult bowel movements; extreme loss of body water; incomplete/infrequent bowel movements; feel like throwing up; stomach cramps; loss of appetite; head pain; throwing up; heartburn; taste problems; low amount of potassium in blood; gas; pelvic pain; not feeling well – all of which are known side affects of EMEND and not disclosed with dispensation of the drug. I found the information afterwards on the internet.   I was hospitalized for DAYS with extreme intestinal blockage and in EXTREME pain. I will NEVER take this drug again; I questioned whether I would even continue my cancer treatment if this is what I would have to go through.,1
I went through 6 months of chemotheraphy and was prescribed Emend.  It worked wonders. I never got sick. ,5
I get this med through iv during my chemo therapy.  It does not relieve my nausea.  I have to take other nausea meds with it.,3
"Using the 3 day pan, and have had no nausea, vomiting, and have in fact seen none of the side effects of this medicine until the the 4th chemotherapy treatment when I was really tired, however no where near incapacitate",5
This drug could of killed me...It affected my breathing and my heart..Very scary,1
"I have Breast Cancer & this is my 1st time on this medicine, but I have to say I like it, do to I don't have Nausea & Vomiting, The only side effect I didn't like was the Painful UTI but I found out if I took my Crandberry Pills 3 days before Chemo & after Chemo while I was on this medicine, I didn't have the painful UTI. But other wise I'm not sick in bed like some people are from Chemo, I get up and go for my walk every day after Chemo, then go to work while I was taking this medicine.",5
Extraordinarily effective with minimal side effects. Fatigue is the worst. For those who must pay it is very expensive.,5
My disease progressed through treatment in 3 months as evidenced by a new  bony metastasis. Sorta lives up to it's Kaplan-Meyer curve of an additional 6 months in the intent to treat trials. Overall well tolerated though the hot flashes were difficult as was the constant nausea. ,2
"I am on dialysis for 9 months now it's 3 times a week from Dec-july, now twice a week becaus I can't afford it I have low hemoglobin and my doctor ordered blood transfusion. It is uncomfortable and time consuming now my doctor give me epoetin alfa-eposino 600 iu which he said produce more blood. Is this necessary, I can afford these treatment I basiclly rely from my relatives my insurance doesn't cover all the treatment and medications.",3
This medication has been given by injection 3x a week.  The red blood count is steadily increasing.  ,4
"I have low red blood cells due to Hepatitis C treatment--pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Procrit (epoetin alpha) helped me tremendously--I got my energy back when I had extreme fatigue from the treatment. I Started at 40,000 units per week and it worked so well the Doc put me on every other week. The only thing I noticed on the down side was that the shots sting--but that goes away quickly.",5
He has been on this inj. since 7/2007 he is now on 40000 u every week. usuallly for 2days after the inj. he feels achey and has no energy. He doesn't seem to have too much energy the rest of he week. He is on this for anemia and does have other problems. I thought by now he should be feeling better.  ,2
"I started taking it with dialysis through the machine. Due to my blood work the Dr changed to sub-acute. Every time I took it sub acute I would have a hot flash, sick at my stomach, and start vomiting. I refused to take it again unless I received it through the machine. ",3
"Receiving Epogen 3 times per week with dialysis is constant joint pain, migraine headaches, and most recently extreme high blood pressure.  Eyes were hemoraging, blurred vision, etc..  Make sure you understand all side effects. Be extremely careful & keep up with all blood work.  ",2
"the medication gave me blood clots on my leg, and i stll having the problem.",1
Bone and joint pain,1
"I get epogen 3 times a week, during dialysis.  I am experiencing night sweats which may be related to the drug. It is very disrupting to my sleep!!",3
MAKES ME FEEL SICK AT TIMES TO MY STOMACH AND I SWELL OFTEN AFTER INJECTIONS,3
I get tried of having to go to the doctor three times a week to get my shot.  IfI don;t get my shots and go for a month I get so week I can hadley move to do anything.,5
"I have been on Epo for 22 years, due to renal failture and three kidney transplnats,I don;t think I will ever go off this Med.I am sure happy I have it!",5
I am having severe fatigue and aching.  A;so and perhaps even more upsetting is constant and profuse sweating,3
"I HAVE BEEN ON THIS SHOT FOR YEARS AND IT HAS HELPED ME A LOT. NOW THE DR'S HAVE STARED ME ON ARANESP AND I FEEL TERRRIBLE. COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS MED IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN EPOGEN?   THANK YOU, MARIE  ",5
"i got bloodclots that went into my eyes lost most of the sight in my right eye dotor said sight might never come back or might take 6 months to a year.getting laser treatment every 2 weeks. dr. said it could happen again, could lose sight in other eye. stopped taken shots afraid of going completely blind",1
It has been very painful on the side of the ijection,3
became very ill when given durning dialysis. feal sick to my stomach for 2-3 days after dialysis.,1
"Increase blood pressure, headachs and body pain",1
cost of the medication is so prohibitive that it has become impossible to continue.,2
Recd Erbitux for the past six months weekly. Also recd paclitaxol and carboplatin.  Stopped two weeks ago for a much needed break. And side effects worse.  Hair severely thin after one month and very weak with mild face rash etc.  Now having cracking around most nail beds on hands only?                                         Ulcers in mouth still bleeding and very painful!  Never dreamed stopping drugs chemo.....etc would make me feel worse!,3
"My husband died two weeks ago following a severe allergic reaction which began immediately after the start of his first infusion.  Erbitux is known for causing allergic reactions on the first dose, possibly related to a history of tick bites.  Read up about this drug before you take it.  For those with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer the extra time it buys is something on average of 10 weeks.  10 weeks we didn't get.  ",1
This drug needs more testing.My husband had half a treatment when he started itching then could not breathe was taken by anbulance to hospital kept over night. then send home 2 days later had a stroke belived to have been caused by the reaction to this drug. was in hospital for 6 weeks transfered to rehab 2 days later passed away.Was horrible never was allergic to anything. this drug should be removed for now.,1
"I'm taking for mouth/throat cancer.  The bad face acne is clearing after 3 wks with hydrocortizone.  Cuticle skin is splitting and getting infected, dry skin is tolerable but extremely dry hands.  Messing up my mouth badly. Thank God, tho, no nausea or heart side effects, so i rate this well.   ",4
"Took with alymta, ninth treatment experienced shortness of breath-went to emergecy room- now in hospital and still can't breath-on oxygen and no prognosis if lung damage is permanent-very dangerous with little benefit-i would never had use it if i thought it was so dangserous-i may die soon",1
"In Feb 09 I was DX with colon cancer that masticated to my lungs first and then to liver.  I have been treated with various chemo drugs with out much effect.  In Jan 2011 I was started on IV Chemo Drug Camptosar IV with Erbitux.  I have experienced all the skin rash side effects listed in all the above reviews.  However my CAE had been stabilized around 6.6 - 8.7.  However, since being on Exbitux my CAE has increased dramatically over the last 4 months from 6.9 to 24.5.  So far my Oncologist has not been able to determine why this is happening.  Some reviewers above experienced just the opposite effect of Erbitux on their CAE numbers.  This has me very concerned.",1
"My husband almost died yesterday from a severe allergic reaction only seconds into his first treatment.  After a short ambulance ride from the cancer center to the hospital, he was stabilized in ER & is now in intensive care & feeling better.  They are concerned that he might have had heart damage & are currently doing a blood test every 6 hours hoping his level will stabilize or decline. Other than his oral cancer, he has been very healthy with no known allergies or other medical problems.  Very scary.",1
"Nearly Killed my mother in law. After 1 treatment she was unable to walk with out assitance,was almost completly unresponsive.  She had to be hospitalized for over a week. Please think long and hard about taking this drug. It is not as safe as tylenol as we  were told. Its side effects are Not less than you have with tylenol!    Do your reaserch as a family and make a well informed decison before taking this drug.  Remember the goal is to improve your quailty of life not ruin it!",1
"had drug with radiation.  Rash was inside and outside body.  Tough to deal with.  2month post, gray eyebrows started growing dark brown and long/narley.  mustache hair increased from barely there.  6month post, still have some rash new yet.  headaches and mucous (bad smell).",4

"I had severe facial/scalp acne after loading dose and 1st treatment. Onc adjusted dose and that helped a lot. Still have rash on chest & back and some on face/neck, but very tolerable.  The extremely dry skin and the splitting of the skin on fingers, toes, feet and legs is less tolerable, but my CEA has dropped in 4 months significantly for the first time in 1.5 yrs. It's worth it for me!",5
"Seems to work at holding cea count from getting higher but not improving the numbers, 4th week on it had the rash issue on face (especialy around the nose,cheek area), head and sholders but this has gotton better with a med(cream)the doctor gave me. Looks like my doctor will continue but don't know where ths is leading right now. I'm stage 4 colon which spread to my liver and lungs and this is what were dealing with now these areas two arears.",1
I am am Male diagnosed with phase 2 throat cancer in the tonsils. First few weeks on Erbitux were fine and then the acne kicked in. Doctors prescribed minocyline and it mostly cleared up. But by week 4 my gut was unable to take solid foods (lost 40 lbs during treatment) after treatment my gut was still bad and tests showed H.Pylori so this may have been present all along but early treatment would have made my conditions much less severe (Erbitux targets all mucosal cells). If you have stomach problems do not let your doctor ignore them as a course of Losec would likely have kept the H.Pylori and tender stomach at bay long enough to finish treatment. 4 weeks after Erbitux and radition are finished my gut is just starting to accept solids (after treatment for H.Pylori)though my mouth has taken this long to start to heal from the radiation. Still suffering from extreme dry mouth though this from what I was told before treatment is a result of damage to the salivary glands done by the radiation treament. The surface skin on my neck healed in record time likely due to a mixture of skin lotions and one in particular seemed to work wonders (called Natures Aid). I only wish I healed internally as quick!  Going for a follow up CAT scan in 3 weeks so keeping my fingers crossed.      ,3
"There is another drug called Nimotuzumab that does the same thing as Erbitux, but does not cause any rashes or other skin conditions. The drug doesn't have to cause a rash to be effective.  Nimo has not yet been approved in U.S. (going thru trials), but was just approved in Mexico. Already approved in India, China, and about 20 other countries. Just search for it on any search engine, you won't have trouble getting more info.",1
"The information above is required, but I have only had 3 treatments and am not sure how effective it is.  I have rectal cancer.  I have experienced extreme dry skin and acne on my face.  Antibiotics and over the counter Proactiv seem to be helping and my face is getting better.",3
"first 8 infusions caused shadowy area on PET that was needle biopsied cancer to disappear.  Three months later PET showed hot spot in a different area, on my tongue, and after 7 infusions, the number value went down but it was still present so am taking more treatments.",4
I have a stage 4 squamous cell sinus tumor. After 3 tx/s of the Erbitux I could see the  tumor shrinking. I've had no problems with this drug.,5
"I came out in a severe rash all over my head and face, it felt like a bad sunburn and someone rubbing it with sandpaper all the time, it was very painfull for about 2 weeks, even the pain meds from my doc did not work",1
"Because the caregivers felt that the tumor in my lung had actually started in the head/neck area this medication was prescribed.  After four weekly injections a chest x-ray revealed the tumor was larger and the side effects included an ugly red rash from the waist on up, extreme acne which prompted a trip to the dermatology department,  a numbness on the soles of both feet, a chronic dry mouth condition and changes in bowel movements. As this was going on it was getting more and more difficult to breath.  The doctors made no mention of stopping this treatment and allowed it to continue for five more weekly sessions.  Another chest x-ray showed the tumor was even larger than before and it was then that I said NO MORE ERBITUX!!!   This medication messed up my body with no benefit whatsoever!!  I am now",1
"I am taking Erbitux for NSCLC (lung cancer), am 30 years old. Not sure how effective it is, but if effectiveness is gauged by the severity of rash... this stuff works. I have rash all over my back, face, head, stomach and my skin is awfully thin. This is my maintenance drug so hopefully will not be on it forever because yeah it's kind of nasty on the fingernails/toenails. Besides that I look ugly and people think I am weird... compliments my baldness.",4
"I have stage 4 colon CA which has spread to my lung.  I've been taking Erbitux for about 1.5 years.  I have experienced severe skin problems: swelling of my hands,many fissures on hands and fingertips, Hair loss and much DRY skin which flakes off everywhere.  I don't know how I have any skin left!  I've tryed just about every lotion and cream,OTC and RX with little relef.  Now I wear surgical gloves at home 24/7 which seem to protect my poor fingers alittle and allow me to do chores. My fingers bleed and are really painful so I also use New Skin liquid as a barrier over the open areas.  That stuff really burns when you first put it on but it is a good protective barrier once it drys. Hair loss seems to be very common- I buy wigs from the cancer society and have fun changing hair styles. I have fairly recently developed severe acne-type sores primarily on my head. They are very irritating, itchy and cause nasty exudate. I've tryed calamine lotion to dry it out, oral antibiotics work well and I'm now trying topical antibiotics--I'll see how it works. Well, you know...it's ALWAYS SOMETHING!",4
i am 16 months post treatment and have developed servere skin problins including hair loss. anyone had similar experiences. cancer has hopefully gone. all check ups have been good. but quality of life is very bad with the skin problem,3
dx in 03/06 w/stage 4 colon cancer this is my 3td treatment w/ this drug acne did start after the 1st treatment on nose and chin. started to lose hair in the hand fulls after the 2nd treatment. overall this is new for me then the prior chemo that I have completed. but the antibotics have dried up most of the acne. just have some sore spots on my head where the hair has left.,4
"Diagnosed stage 4 in Oct. 06. After liver resection in 7/07, was put on erbitux along with Irenotecan and 5 months post op, the liver is growing back healthy with no signs of cancer.  The acne appeared on my face after the first treatment then on the neck later.  Skin became severely dry and a month after treatments ended I am having problems with finger and toenails ingrown because the skin is so thin.  Also started losing my hair in the last few weeks.",5
"The drug caused severe acne the first time I was administered it.  Subsequent dosing has led to less severe reactions, but I still have acne.",4
severe acne and have only had 3 treatments so far and will start radiation next week  i hope this works as i can barely stand looking at myself ,3
"I have been taking this drug sense 01/02/18. I had more than 25 sores over my head. now, there is only a few and it even took big sores away and still going strong. I didn't really had any side affects to worry about. I had low self esteem when I had sores all over my head and face people can see. now, my low self esteem has gone away and I look better and more happier. awesome meds",5
"Introduced to the new drug by my dermatologist in late 2012, an irregular heartbeat prevented removal of the long negleted basil cell by normal surgery. The cell located above my right eye. After 3 months of treatment, 150 MG pill, my doctor was amazed at the progress of the healing factor, summoning staff to observe.  A side effect,losing the sensation of taste in non spicy-foods (hot)while bearable did contribute to a welcomed  weight loss at first. The continuing loss became alarming after a point and I started using protien supplements loaded with vitamins and was perscribed monthly B-12 injections by my PCP. 7 months into the treatment the cell was reduced considerably, although my eye was producing tears at a rate the drainage system couldn't handle. Appontments for heart monitering were undertaken during this time period also. Fearing the cancer had moved into my eye socket I was advised to stop the drug and see the staff of an eye clinic to diagnose the problem. After 2 months of intermittent tests and laser eye surgery to open a vent in one of the Y shaped drain flaps, which I was informed was tilted toward the other due to eye pressure and caused a  narrowing was performed to increase drainage. I was advised the procedure was a success although the watering continued for weeks until the follow up with the Eye Clinic stated nothing more could be done. An upcoming appointment with another eye specialist and resuming the drug regime 1 1/2 months ago including laser treatments to the infected area above the eye with another treatment due after the eye appointment. Initial reversal of the effects of the cancer were welcomed and prove this drug is benefical in treating the disease. Side effects are tolerable as stated and I highly recommend it's effectivness.

I am 83 years old and have been taking Evista for about 18 years. I am convinced that it has kept my bones strong as I have taken a few bad falls with no broken bones. My bone density test in 2015 showed as excellent and in the top 5% of my age group.,5
I had osteoporosis.  I’ve been taking Evista for just over a year.  My latest bone density scan shows and improvement.  I’m no longer in the osteoporosis range but have improved and now have osteopenia. I also work out 3 times a week doing barre classes which includes weight bearing exercises and a lot of strengthening of the core muscles.  This life style and medication are working for me.  I tried Fosomax and the jaw pain it caused was incredible so I’m on this and very happy with it so far.  Best of luck everybody in your treatments. ,4
I have taken Evista for about five years.  My teeth started going bad and the oral surgeon said that Evista was the cause.  If it has made my teeth to break off then what is it doing to my bones???  I am going to stop taking it.  ,1
"In 2016 I gave this medicine a better rating because it seemed to take away my hip and spine pain. Now, I am not sure what to say, but I owe you people to be honest: my new condition may have nothing to do with this medicine, but this one is the only one I have been taking for the last 26 months, so I am afraid it could have had some influence. I was diagnosed with MEC (mucoepidermoid carcinoma - of the minor salivary glands - on the mouth palate). I have never smoked in my life or drink heavy alcohol. I am not taking any other drug for a chronic disease. Of course, it could be something genetic: my father had laryngeal cancer at the age 74 but he also was a heavy smoker and drinker (I am 53 and neither of my siblings got such a disease). Just be warned - in case you experience any odd symptoms like vertigo when standing up (but not when walking), or feel like scratching your back all the time -especially when you lay down in the bed - these might be symptoms of the neoplasic syndrome. Thoroughly check every inch of your skin, and also every millimeter of your mouth, tongue, whatever. Do not ignore any new formation like I did: Initially it was like bump in the center of the mouth palate, then it turned into a lesion. I kept postponing going to undergo surgery.Do not make this mistake in case something ""fishy"" is going on under your skin!!! I wish you the best pf health always!",3
"I've taken Evista for a few years; my doctor wants me to stop Evista and start taking a biphosphonate.  I have chosen to follow a more natural, holistic treatment to increase my bone mass.  St one point my mass increased and my last density test showed a decrease.  so I would have to say the Evista is not that effective nor preventative.",2
"I've been taking Raloxifene almost 2 yrs. Lots of leg swelling and pain. Hot flashes, joint and back pain, blurred vision ,insomnia, weight gain bloating, sharp pains in my head, now tendons in hands and feet are tightening up. I've stopped taking this drug ",1
"Took Evista for one month.  At the beginning, my nerves were affected - gave me shakes.  That went away, but then the intense bone and joint pain began.  I had constant pain, could not sleep at night. Would wake up when I turned over in bed.  Then after one week, my legs, ankles and feet began swelling.  This swelling never went away, was told by my doctor to discontinue and when the side effects were gone would start taking Boniva.  Still not able to take any new drugs since the swelling has continued one month after quitting the drug. ",1
"I was diagnosed with borderline osteoporosis two years ago (-2.5), and decided to switch from a low dose of Estradiol (which had caused high blood pressure) to Evista.  I've had hot flashes the whole time, but sweated through them.  I just had my second bone density scan, though, and my osteoporosis is worse (-2.8).  So, unfortunately it didn't help me.",1
"After a 10-month treatment with Evista I haven't experienced any of the symptoms I read here. On the contrary, my spine/hip won't hurt as much as in the past; actually, I rarely feel any pain. I haven't repeated DEXA because of the short duration of treatment. But I am optimistic...",4
Severe pains in lower legs. Getting to the point hard to walk the pain is so bad. Done with Evista starting today before I cannot walk at all. Pain is bad..,2
"I have been taking Evista oral for over 15 years when I was diagnosed Osteopenic. No reverse effects, and my bone loss is minimalized.",5
"Been taking Evista for over three years and my bone loss has been halted with no further decline so I was very pleased. But for the last six months I have been experiencing joint & muscle pain, especially in knees and hips. Just dawned on me it could be Evista after rereading the side effects. Stopped taking it a week ago and already seeing some improvement--will stay off until my next dr appt. I hate it because I have a family history of breast cancer and osteoporosis so I was very hopeful this would work. Not ruling out taking it again in several months after I talk with my doctor and see if the pain goes away.",4
"I have taken Evista for several years. My bone density did improve somewhat. I stopped taking it on March 25, 2015 due to night sweats, restless legs, and severe and debilitating leg pain. It had gotten to the point that i was experiencing severe leg/hip pain 90% of the time. It severely limited my daily tasks and activities. I have been off Evista now for 3 1/2 months. The leg pain has improved dramatically; but has not completely gone away. I am praying that it will continue to improve as time goes on. ",3
Just stepped over from osteopenia to osteoporosis couple yrs ago and Dr. put me on Evista. After 2 yrs using it bone density test showed an increase in osteoporosis so option now is to go on Fosomax after discussing other drugs.I'm so disappointed I wasted 2 yrs using Evista only to get worse.Biggest problem I think is that insurance companies don't allow bone density tests less than 23 mos. - yet they'll pay for a drug during that time that might be useless as this was for me. Doesn't make sense. This time I'll pay for a one yr. DEXA myself just so I'm not stuck using a drug longer unnecessarily - should that prove the case w/me once again. I lost 2 yrs of increasing my bone mass - or at least stopping further decrease in bone mass by using Evista. I am not in a risk category for breast cancer but that was one of the benefits my Dr. touted when prescribing Evista. The risk of stroke w/Evista was more a concern for me. Very disappointed in this drug costing me two yrs.time. I gotta hope the fosamax works toward not only stopping the progression but perhaps increasing my bone mass to take back that which Evista took away. Here's hoping!,1
"Dr switched me from fosamax to evista because I had been on it for more than 5 years.  Fosamax increased my bone density from mild osteo to osteopenia. Will have dexa after another year, so don't know about effectiveness of evista yet. Side effects have been mild:  some hot flashes, foot and leg cramps mostly at night. Nothing troubling.  If this continues and my bone density also increases I will continue taking it.",1
"I have experience excruciating hot flashes day and night and severe night sweats to where my night clothes are wet when I wake up in the morning.  My sleep pattern has changed, I toss and turn all night.  My mood swings are WAY OUT THERE!!!!!!  My family, social, and work life are very difficult to tolerate.  I am just about ready to stop cold turkey but I know there would be other risks as well.  I have tried contacting my oncologist and she will not return my phone calls.  I'm to the point of falling into excessive depression.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!",2
"I took Evista 5 years and had horrible hot flashes and night sweats.  I was given Effexor to reduces these symptoms.  The Effexor help cover up a side effect I had but did not realize until I went off Evista in June.  I went off Effexor and soon I started have shooting pain, numbness and swelling of my feet.  I also had numbness in my hands.  I stopped taking in June and my feet and hands are beginning to show some improvement.  I hope eventually this will go away.  I did consult my doctor and he agreed this is probably what caused my problems.  Blood work was done to insure I was not diabetic, etc. I'm sure in some people this drug is great.  I'm not sure I would have taken this drug if I had know what I know now.",4
"After discussion with dr today, will go off Evista for one year. I've not seen a decrease in bone density after multiple years on this drug.  I have experienced extended years of hot flashes, leg cramps and other symptoms that I attributed to menopause from 2007 but learned today that Evista also causes same symptoms.  Also had to have cat scan for possible blood clot after chest pain, blood clot is another side effect.",2
"I have been taking this medication for one year with few side effects, only some weight gain and few leg cramps. I will have another bone density test soon and hope to see some results.",3
"I stopped taking Evista 6 months ago, after taking it for 10 years post breast cancer.  I had no side effects while on Evista.  Within 3 weeks after stopping it, I began having really intense pressure in my head which has continued for 6 months.  Additionally, my eyes became extremely dry, to where I cannot wear my contacts.  I also now have ringing in my ears.  I have had extensive blood work, in addition to a neck and brain MRI, plus sinus CT and everything has come out normal.  Could it be due to stopping the Evista?  Has anyone else had a similar experience?",5
I have been taking Evista 60mg for two years now with no side effects. It has had positive effects as my most recent scan showed a significant increase in bone density. ,5
"I have been taking Evista for approximately 3 weeks prescribed by my gynocologist; I am an 8 year breast cancer survivor and 2 year post hysterectomy.  I have suffered from hot flashes for the past 5 years and they finally started to lessen until I started taking Evista and the hot flashes have returned with a vengence.  I have pain into my left foot and left toe feels like a fractured bone) Hot flashes have disrupt my sleep, headache, sinus issues, balance isseus.  I am going to contact my oncologist for his recommendation - I do not believe I will continue this medication.  ",1
I wastold do NOT take if you are OVER 75,3
"I was prescribed Evista for osteopenis.   Extremely healthy my entire life.   As  someone else reported I developed a ""blood   clot on my optic nerve"" and lost vision in my  right eye..... called NAION. I was told to   stop med immediately.  Don't know if it was   ever reported to FDA.  Probably too   much paperwork for busy doctors.",1
The first month of taking this medication I had no side effects.  I am on month 2 now and have painful and swollen hands.  My fingers feel like I have arthritis and I cannot get my rings off now.  Hoping this will subside.  If not I may switch to another drug.,3
"I have symptom since I started Evista -  leg/foot cramps, fatigue, insomnia and interrupted sleep, but did not fit them together till I read the side effects that some had in the tests. I will stop taking it according to my doctors recommendations.",2
"Started this med in 1997.  Not sure how effective it is - where would my bones be without it ? No side effects or pain or breaks. It is way too expensive for a drug that has been in use for so many years, but I'm staying on it until I'm sure it isn't doing enoug",3
I ended up having breast cancer instead of preventing it.  Aggressive and invasive type of 100 percent estrogen cancer!  I took Evista for over 10 years and I have nothing but regret.,1
"I am an active 68 year old female whose grandmother and mother died of breast cancer.  My sister, 2 years younger, recently had breast cancer, treated and so far doing okay.  I had been on Fosomax when my doctor told me about Evista. The only side effects I have experienced are that I have gained a little weight and sweat, especially after a glass of wine (-: but considering the options I am quite satisfied with Evista.",4
"I have been taking Evista since January 2013. I have gained weight and the past two months have experienced a tingling sensation in my fingers.  Has anyone else had this feeling?  Sometimes my upper right arm hurts along with my fingers.  I was on Boniva IV for 2 years and my bone density in lower spine decreased.  This is the reason my dr. told me to take Evista.  Also, for many years took Foxamax and that didn't help.  Maybe just taking extra calcium will help.",3
I have developed muscle weakness in my lower legs & am seeing a neurologist. I have stopped taking Evista & lost 5 pounds.,1
So far I haven't noticed any issues with taking this drug and it has helped to keep my bone mass from decreasing.,5
"I was on evista for many years and felt great, now on prolia and Doc. Took evista away. I,m now after two mos. feeling down and teary eyed a lot, was evista also a mood inhanser.",5
DO NOT TAKE EVISTA! Within a month of taking Evista. I developed a blood clot in the vessels of my eye which caused vision loss in my left eye.,1
"I have very few side effects, most bothersome is sweating.  I would rather take this medicine than some of the others out there for Osteoporosis.",4
"Have been on Evista for how long I really wouln't know but. of late have had a nurse tells me to ask primary when started and how to ;ong to take it drug as, of late have alot sweating on forhead esp. under breasts which hasn't happened in ouite awhile and she says there's quite alot of mixed answeer What is your answer?",2
"According to its manufacturer, Evista can be used to help prevent invasive breast cancer, but not to prevent a recurrence.  In addition, it is not for premenopausal women, nor is it used to prevent noninvasive breast cancer or a recurrence thereof.  I have been taking Evista for about two months but am premenopausal and in remission for noninvasive breast cancer.  Not sure if this med is appropriate for me, and not enjoying the weight gain, depression, and general feeling of sluggishness that seem to accompany it.  Will discuss with doctors and hopefully discontinue use.",1
Took this medication for only 3 weeks.  At the 3rd week I started having severe leg cramps and could not sleep for 2 nights.  Dr. advised stopping and checked for clots which I did not have.  Also started feeling nauseas.  4th week my whole body was achy but with Advil it was tolerable.  Took over a month to get out of my system ,1
I have not been on the drug long enough to give a good/bad review,1
i have not taken is drug yet.,1
I haven't used it long enough to know much about it. Need to know how it has affected others.,4
"Have been a breast cancer survivor for 6 years.  Started on Arimidex post radiation, supposedly as an 'estrogen prohibitor' to decrease my chances of returning breast cancer.  After 1 year, was switched to Aromasin as finger, hand, joint pain was consistent and difficult, and was prohibiting my computer work and golf.  Aromasin wasn't much better, so I after 4 years my Oncologist switched me to eVista.  After two years, though I felt less pain in the hands and finger joints, my leg and foot cramps have become so severe, I truly thought I either had bone cancer or thromboflibitis (sp)or thrombosis of the legs.  Pain was excruciating up into the thigh.  After reading these other reviews referring to the leg cramps, I am definitely stopping the drug.  The pain is obviously a result of this drug and not worth the 2-3 times per night cramping I am getting.",2
"Started taking Evista less than a week (4 days)and have itching and a rash on my trunk and inside of arms especially when I get warm or have exerted myself physically.  Also, as another reviewer, get itching at nighttime about 3 hours after taking this medicine.",2
No problems,4
"I just commented (Dec 2012) but failed to mention that since I stopped Evista in Jan 2012 I did increase my calcium (USP graded) to 1400mg - half plant-sourced and half calcium citrate and carbonate, also started taking 3000iu of vit D3 with my regular antioxidants, fish oil etc.",1
"I started Evista July 2010 and within one year began experiencing night sweats, left leg pain when sitting, right hip pain in bed, finger pain in joints, left knee pain when walking, and also bruised easily. I thought this was due to old age at 70 until I read the reviews for Evista in Jan 2012  and realized ""thats me"". I immediately stopped Evista and my night sweat was gone in 1 1/2 wks plus all my other pains left shortly after. I became completely pain free and today Dec 2012 remain pain free.",1
"I've been on Evista for about 10 years and am very satisfied. This week I had a Dexascan and the doctor has called asking me to come in and talk about the test results. I am afraid that the Evista either has run it's course or it needs to be increased or something. Reviewing the lawsuits and the side effects of all the other medications listed, I am afraid he is going to want to move me to something different and I am just not going to do it. Evista is just too great.",5
still have thinning bones and have hot flaSHES ,1
I took 5 doses of Evista & woke up with severe pains in my knee!  I could not figure out what I did & then I realized joint pain was listed on the side effects.  I stopped taking & it's day 6 of pain!  Nothing helps & I am limping around...so horrible it should be taken off the market!!!,1
"my body itches a lot. especially in the evening. I stop to use this medication for a week now, Isn't because from this medication ? anyone has the same experience ?",4
I have taken Evista 7 years and have had no problems,5
"I have been on Evista for 21 months and just had my second BMD test revealing a decrease in my T-score; Evista has done nothing for me except allow me to suffer the side effects of hot flashes, chills, leg cramps, weight gain(and I have a thin frame), insomnia and headaches(which I have never suffered from).  This has been a huge disappointment and waste of money for me. I received my results today, 08/03/12, and of course, have stopped taking Evista.",1
"Was put on Evista after breaking my femur to make my bones stronger. Was on it a couple of weeks when I notice that I was having severe muscle cramps and couldn't hardly walk. Stayed on it for two months and was in so much pain. During this time I fell three times which I was glad I didn't break a bone again. My primary doctor was the one who wanted me on this but after talking to my surgeon about how I was feeling, he told me to get off the medication. In just a couple of days, I felt better than ever. ",1
"My doctor just put me on this, have not taken it yet - but tried the fosomax for a day - had a horrible allergic reaction and almost had to be rushed into the hospital - now my Doc wants me to try this, it looks like there are no drugs that are researched enough that seem to work without horrible side effects.  I am 49, and have osteoporosis, I have been doing a great deal of research and think the best thing is to try - is to take care of it on your own with weight bearing type exercise, vitamins and diet.. From what I understand and the exercise...its the jumping gravity type things that we need to do...for me, to hard to run - Ill be jump rope, and bought a little trampoline along with lifting weights.  My doc will test me in another year, so Ill see then if its working - I would rather try this first before all the drugs that cause such horrible things...Im to young to have this crap anyways, so the whole thing is very frustrating.",1
Side effect --  weight gain,5
"sever pain in joints and bone.  eye fatigue. headaches.  pain in feet, as if bottoms of feet are bruised.  jolts of pain in feet and legs.   three root canals in a row.   (never had these symptoms before evista)",1
"I have used Evista since 1999 and have not had adverse side effects except sometimes cramps on my feet at night, although it is uncertain that this is caused by Evista. Other than that, I take it on a daily basis without fail and have felt fine.",4
I am 52 and have been using Evista for many years.  My osteoporosis has stablized and I like the added benefit of reducing the risk of breast cancer.  No side effects.  Very satisfied.,4
"Had a hysterectomy in 2006 and after two years of hot flashes, I decided to go on Bio-identical hormones which worked great.  I was recently advised to go off of them.  I have been taking Evista for approximately one month.  I recently began having a hard time sleeping, started getting hot flashes and have gained ten pounds.  I checked WebMd to see what others were saying about this drug and i found that many people seem to be having the same symptoms. I am considering researching to see what other options I have.",3
"I have been taking Evista for 5 years. During the first ten days on Evista I felt as though I had a mild virus, warm, somewhat achey. After that I've had no side effects at all and feel fine on it. Only problem is that while my hip T score improved my spinal T score has gotten worse and I am now have osteoporosis so will have to switch to another medication. Too bad since I liked Evista.",3
"I have been taking Evista for over 5 months after being taken off Tamoxifen.  I take it for osteopenia and breast cancer prevention.  Both drugs have caused severe swelling and pain in my legs and esp knees.  It has traveled to my hips and down to my ankles.  The night cramps are awful and I dream of the pain in my legs.  Terrible pain.  I have osteoartritis and issues with disk degeneration and this med seems to attack those vulnerable areas.  The interesting thing is that my oncologist, breast surgeon, or radiologist believe it is because of these drugs!  Thank you for making me feel heard!! I took myself off of Tamoxifen and felt better in 4 days, went on Evista after my mastectomy and did okay for awhile.  But now I realize I may have done better for a longer period because I had reconstruction 3 months ago and was on mega doses of Celebrex for 2 months.  I think that masked the side effects of Evista.  I have gone off the drug on my own and this is the 4th day.  The leg cramps are better all ready and I am just waiting for better results.  I could hardly walk.  I am 57 and very active.  Walk, lift weights and am in great health.  I had to take the stairs one at a time, walked with a limp and sometimes my legs would give out.  Early on I thought I had MS.  Three nights ago while out with my family, they had to help me to the car!  The drug is not worth losing my quality of life.  I will see my oncologist again, but will not take this drug.  My first oncologist insisted that in 20 years he had never heard of this happening...read the medication guide and the blogs!  Listen to your patients!  I will let you know how I am doing in a few days.  ",1
"I had a hysterectomy at 49 and went on low dose HRT for about 2 1/2 years with no negative side effects.  I weaned myself off of them knowing they no longer advise HRT beyond 5 years.  Two years later I have been diagnosed with osteopenia and osteoporosis.  I have only been on Evista for 6 weeks.  Weight gain, insomnia and severe hot flashes were immediate.  Now a burning in my hips wakes me up when I finally find sleep.  I've already contacted my Doctor asking for another alternative, but have concerns regarding the many significant side effects the others offer as well.  Either way, today was my last day taking Evista.",1
"This drug was not for me.  Took it 3 weeks and was miserable the entire time. Constant flashes, joint pain, malaise, insomnia and depression. I was achy and hot and crying every day. Not happy with my doctor for prescribing this med. I have a family history of strokes. Now have a paid for 3 month supply sitting in my medicine cabinet. Sorry I let Dr. send in the prescription. He should have given me a sample or just do a trial dosage.  My advice is do not take it.",1
"I have had a heart attack 6 yrs ago and recently stopped Plavix. I started the Evista for swollen mammary glands shortly afterwards. The first week was fine, but the second wk I began having a migraine that lasted for a week, so I stopped the Evista and in two days my migraine finally stopped. I may not be a good candidate for this drug, so I  am just taking my vit e and evening primrose oil and D3. I have had cysts several times, but not swollen glands.  ",2
"After taking Evista for 9 months, my right leg suddenly got so weak (and painful) that I couldn't use it to get up from a chair or go up a step.  I quit taking it and most of the strength has returned but I'm not sure it will ever be back to normal.  I've been in good physical condition and take no other drugs.  I took Fosamax for over 4 years before I realized it might be causing severe pains in the calves of both legs.  I quit taking it and the pains disappeared.  These bone meds are scary and I won't be taking any again.",1
"I've been taking evista for about 4 months.  I have no side effects but after reading the comments I'm getting worried.  I'm reasonably healthy, 51 yrs, in menapause for about 5 yrs; I smoke.  I was diagnosed with ""preni"" ostoprosis which is why my gyn put me on this med.  For the past three weeks my left eye has been blood shot although it doesn't bother me (other than appearance).  Today I have an appointment with my general physician and plan to discuss this drug with him.  Thank you for sharing your expriences.",3
I get more hot flashes since I started using this drug.  My face is always red.,3
"After having my Mom diagnosed with Breast Cancer, I spoke to my Gynecologist and she recommended that I take Evista. I didn't have any side effects until recently when I developed joint pain in my right shoulder, right elbow, and right wrist (I'm a lefty). I decided to stop taking the Evista and see if the pain went away. Some of it has and some of it hasn't so I don't know if the pain is related to the Evista or not. I did have some ""warm flushes"" when I first started taking Evista, but, they have gone away. I do stop taking it when I vacation at places where I will be sitting alot, like on the beach, or when I am going to be flying a long distance and won't be able to walk around.  I guess I'd rather take the Evista than risk having Breast Cancer. ",4
"Day 1 - light headed and hot flashes Day 2 - lower back pain, hot flashes and            light headed, lower leg cramps.",1
"I took Evista for 9 months and then suddenly had severe weakness and pain in my rt. leg.  Then my left leg also developed pains.  I quit taking Evista and the weakness and pains soon disappeared. I had previously taken Fosamax for several years and had severe leg pains during most of that time until I eventually figured out that Fosamax was the cause (my Doctors never identified it as being a possible cause of the pains). I refused to take any other bisphosphonates, but Evista did not appear to be a bisphosphonate and I agreed to try it. ",1
"3 days after starting this med I began to develop a rash on both arms, neck and upper chest area. I also noticed ""leg jerks"" which kept me up at night. By day 4 I was in extremem pain with severe burning, pain from the rash which had grown worse and the affected areas were swollen, hot and causing me such pain I could not eat, sleep or go to work. I was reduced to tears. I also began to wonder if I had developed RLS. After an emergency visit to my pcp and dermatologist, I was started on a taper dose of prednisone. Bothe md's said the ""rash"" was a serious allergic reaction to either a food or med. Since evista was the only new med (I only take over the counter vitamins and caltrate) and I had not had a new food item, I think the evista was the culprit. I stopped it and will not restart even to experiment if the drug was the culprit. i never want to experience that nauseating pain again. After 4 days on the prednisone the symptoms are abating.",1
"I was on Evista for about 6 years.  Weight gain started immediately for me right away.  After 6 years the pounds have piled up on me.  My boobs always felt bloated.  And I hated the constant hot flashes.    In the past year I started having nightly leg pain in my thighes, which kept me awake a lot of nights.  I ran out of Evista so I did not take it for a few weeks.  I noticed my legs stopped hurting and I was able to sleep, my boobs didn't feel bloated anymore, and I had no more hot flashes.  --  I got more Evista and took it for another month, and the same symptoms returned.  --  Now I am not taking it anymore, and I feel normal again.",2
"I started Evista about six months ago and about 4 months into the daily use of it my left ankle began swelling and I experienced severe cramping on the bottom of the left foot which caused considerable difficulty in just walking (I was actually limping).  The pain was radiating from the big toe to the ankle which felt like it was broken or cracked and then up the inner calf to the knee cap area.  The pain was so intense, I wondered to myself if I had bone cancer.  It also began to radiate up my inner thigh.  I had no injuries or other things that would explain this.  Finally, when I could no longer take the pain and it seemed to become increasingly worse every day, I went to my doctor.  He thought an EMG of the nerves and muscles in the leg were needed.  Well, the EMG did not show any sign of significant nerve damage, so I mentioned to him again that I had been on Evista and that was the only thing that I could possibly think of that could be causing this. He listened to me and we both concluded to stop taking the Evista for a good ten days and see what would happen.  As soon as I stopped taking the Evista cold turkey, the symptoms began to very gradually go away, every day I was starting to feel better and better.  Now I knew for sure what was causing me all of this pain and suffering and mental anguish!  I still may go back in for testing to make sure that I don't have a deep vein blood clot while I still have some health insurance.  I am telling you think more than twice about taking this Evista, I would not want to go through this again.  Shame on the makers of Evista for releasing such a drug to the public....further testing and findings should be done on it.  It carries too much risk for what it's worth.  I was on Fosamax before Evista but Fosamax had no effect on my bone density. Then the Evista was even worse.  After all of this I am going back to getting more exercise and eating more calcium and vitamin D in my diet..at least I know what I am putting in me.",1
the other meds on the market made all my joints hurt as soon as I took them. THis one does not.,4
I have taken Evista since 2000. I have had no side effects. My bones have not broken since then nor do I have weakness. At 70 I walk 3 miles at least 4 times a week. I enjoy walking with my 80 pound Labradoodle. I recommend this bone strengthening drug.,5
"65 years old, Evista for past 2 years, halted my osteoporosis, proven by DEXA. Failed on all bisphosphonates: extreme flu-like symptoms, body aches. Side effects with Evista: Leg cramps: everynight, horrible, had to use hot soaks to relieve the pain. Found online someone who advised Benadryl 25 mg at bedtime, it worked! No, I didn't have insomnia prior, but relief of painful cramping was amazing. Other questions: I have had bilateral trochanteric bursitis for past 18 months, steroid injections notwithstanding. Currently past 6 weeks with plantar fasciitis in right foot. Never had either of above in past and no precipitating trauma.  Recently read that Evista may contribute to ovarian cancer. Women are between a rock and a hard place with choices for treatment for osteoporosis. Where is the continuing research? We are our own advocates but time is short for those of us needing to prevent the sequelae of untreated or undertreated osteoporosis!",3

Switched from Actonel to Evista due to the horrific leg cramps that the Actonel was causing. I've been on the Evista for three months now with no side effects at all and leg cramps have disappeared. Very satisfied with this medication. ,5
"I don't know the results yet, but after almost one year, I am not happy with the product.  I will stop taking this mediction because I am having hip pain and shortness of breath.  I don't know if Evista is the reason, but I am definitely going off of it to see if the paid stops.  I am a very small woman who is very active and I don't want this pain anymore.  I hope there is some natural solution to this problem.  I am afraid also to take reclast since it is a one year treatment.",1
"I have been on evista for 3 weeks and have gone thru finger pain,leg pain,hip pain. Thought they would go away after on it awhile.But now my back is in so much pain from shoulders to lower back. I can`t stand long,sitting isn`t good either.Last night I almost fell from right hip and leg pain to knee. Back was in spasms (spelling),was really scared.

"After a little over a week, I began to have trouble sleeping which wasn't helped by usual sleep med.  Also increased hot flashes, sweating, and muscle jerks at night. After 3 days without, I am returning to normalcy.",2
"I took it for a period of a year and got an increase of bone mass in my hip area.  I than freaked out and worried about clot risk, went off it for a year and dropped some bone mass.  I have gone back on it for about a year and have yet to have another scan.  I don't seem to have any terrible side effects, but if I travel without room for motion I drop it during that period.",3

I have been taking Evista for about 5 years on and off.  I have been getting painful  severe sinus infections.  I blamed it on the fact that I am an elementary school teacher and I am exposed to constant germs and bacteria working with 5 year olds.   I have had 4 severe and extremely painful sinus infections since November. For one of them I went to the dentist with the pain that was coming from a tooth.  He said it was a sinus infection.  I went to an ENT.  He did a CT scan  when my sinuses were clear and healthy.... and my sinuses are normal .There is nothing abnormal causing this. I just found out sinus irritation is a side effect Of EVISTA!!!!   Does any one else experience any sinus problems on this medication?  ,3
I suffer with cramps in my leg when i take this med it will stop but i notice  some rash on my feet which was not there before.,3

I read the STAR report, I know the stats on how this drug prevents additional breast cancer.  I plan to continue unless side effects worsen and need to revaluate.",2
 I have had breast cancer and am concerned because of the hormone in evista,3
too many adverse side effects,1
"After 11 months of taking Evista, I developed pain in my legs, hips and back so severe that I was afraid I would fall + could not sleep at night. All physical activity was affected.  Physician gave me xrays, MRI and a nuclear bone scan - all negative but said Evista wasn't causing it.  I took myself off of Evista at 18 months due to a air flight I had to take, did not tell my physician.   Thirty-six hours after the last pill, pain in my legs and back  started subsiding and now (10 days later) have had no pain whatsover.   Will call my physician this week and let him know.  Will try again for ten days as a confirmation of Evista causing the pain but if pain comes back, will back off completely. My T-score was only  -1.4 to begin with.   These last ten days have been great - I can exercise again and have regained  my  strength - hopefully I can start running again.  I'm also not in a continual hot flash and I feel so much better.",4

Then I noticed that one of the side effects were leg pain.  I will go off for a few months to see if my legs get better. ",5
"I Developed a BLOOD CLOT in My Lower Right  LEG 2 weeks ago while taking EVISTA! Iwas in the Hospital 5 DAYS & I'm on Cumadine to GET Rid of the BLOOD CLOT!!!!! My Visiting Nurse is the Person who saw a BLACK BOX warning about EVISTA!!! I quit taking it IMMEDIATELY!!!!! My Doctor was alerted & told me to QUIT taking it, as I ALREADY DID!!!! WHY are these Drugs on the MARKET, having such Severe Consequences??????",3
Have been on this drug for 2 years with no additional bone loss.  Only side effect is night sweats (similar to those experienced peri-menopausal.),5
"I was given Evista in 1999, took it for 4 years, developed high blood pressure and I fainted on a daily basis for 1 year. I was totally house bound. In 2009 I had a hysterectomy in order to take estrogen without the risk of cancer. My bone density was not good after a year. So the Doctor upped the estrace and put me back on Evista. I have spent the last few months suffering. I bloated to where I looked 6 months pregnant, constipation and my blood pressure just went wacky. One minute high and the next too low. I was waking up at night with severe leg cramps and my legs would be sore for days afterwards. So by trial and error I went off the Evista and Estrace and my symptoms have completely subsided. I have not been able to tolerate any of the Osteoporosis meds what so ever. I will try taking half of the estrace every other day to see what that will do. I really believe that these Osteoporosis meds are more harmful then good. I think we are being used as guinea pigs. So please beware if you take any of these meds. The minute you have a problem get off them. I have lasting high blood pressure from these meds. My doctor does not feel these meds caused my problems, but I learned they did. Listen to what your body is telling you. If you don't heed the warning signs, no one else will.",1
"I had a vein break on my crotch.  When I called the doctor, I was told this happens for up to six months and then seems to stop.  They left it up to me if I want to continue with the med.  My mother and brother have strokes.  I worry about broken blood vessels.",3
I have had an increase in breast size an overall weight gain.  I can not loose it. When I cut down to 3 pills a week a few pounds came off but still my breasts seem to be getting larger.  I can not take the Fosamax family of drugs as I have long bone and joint pain including jaw pain from these.  Am I alone with this problem?,3
I will have to talk to my doctor for another type of treatment.  I develped severe gasto problems,2
"After taking this for 6 months, started having terrible bruising, even worse leg cramps and gained 10 pounds.  Been on it for about a year, but will now stop (I have my doctor's approval) to see if these problems get better.  Due for another bone scan in 6 months, so we'll see. Don't know if problems were caused by Evista, since I take other meds, but after reading other posts, it's a distinct possibility.   ",3
"Been on Evista for almost 2 years. Fight depression, sleepless nights, terrible hot flashes, weight gain, have been working on getting cholesterol down for almost 3 years and just found out it has gone up, and my tryglcerites have jumped 200 points in  one year! I not taking this anymore. Terrible expensive with no insurance coverage, over $300.00 for 3 months.",3
I have been on Evista not even a month.I developed extreme sweating day and night.But that was not the worst part I developed muscle pain and cramps in my left hip and leg so sever I could hardly walk.There were times I had to wait until the cramps eased somewhat(because they never go away) to try and walk.This medication has been a terrible experience for me. I could not stand to take them any longer.,1
"As Ms. saffron wrote in Dec.2009, she is telling my story. I have been having terrible leg cramps and increased heartburn. But my worst symptoms are my day and night sweats They have been ruining my life for over seven months. I can not function and I hardly leave my house. I don't get to visit people because my sleep schedule is so off. My sweats begin around 3:00pm and are constant until 9:30am the next day. So this gives me a six hour window when I can finally get a few hours sleep. Thank God I am a retiree. But I am getting so depressed by my situation. Last month my dr. lessened my dose of Evista to every other day to see if I could handle the sweats, but the sweats have not subsided. I'm at wits end. Last week I decided to discontinue the medication in hopes of the sweats stopping and to get my life back. I have not seen much change yet. But, I am holding out hope. I am not interested in Boniva or Fosamax for their esophageal side effects are worse. I already have problems in that area. I will have to see what my dr. has to say when I talk to him next month.",2
Entodontist stated Evista was causing tooth infection preventing normal tooth health,3
No problem.  On it for years.  Foot cramps occasionally but not sure that I didn't have those before taking it.,5
Feel better on an energy level vs. once a week meds.,3
The only negative side effect for me is excessive bruising on my hands and arms. My purse strap even left a huge bruise.,5
I have had so many new medical problems from taking this drug from being in the hospital for chest pains to not be able to sleep at night and everthing in between wish that I never had taken this drug . Still trying to get my body back to where it was before taking this   what a big mistake!!,1
I could not take Actonel due to severe jaw and joint pain.  My Dr. put me on Evista.  Right now I am taking 1/2 pill daily of samples she supplied to see if I can tolerate it.  I have noticed some jaw pain and leg problems in bed.  I do not like taking these bone medications.  If this gets worse I will take my chances with exercise and nutrition.  These meds are scary!,1
Used Fosomax & Boniva which both caused and/or increased severity of hyatil hernia.  With sciatica pain couldn't tolerate not taking any medication in the morning for either of the above.  Switched to Evista with no side effects and osteoporosis is gone down to osteopena.,4
"I was not made aware of all the serious side affects either by my doctors or pharm. I am appalled at the severity of side affects and must say since starting this I have been treated for renal blockage of both renal arteries, and severe high blood pressure.",2
"Took briefly for a few weeks, o.k.Skipped few weeks, began taking again 8/30/09 had violent nausea,vomiting and since I was 65 nyears old and had never in my life vomited, I went to dr. 2 times 2 drs. told me this was not a side-effect. Tried again 3 more times on dr's insistance. The last time I was so sick I thought I was going to have to go to e.r. Very costly since I missed work and had a huge doctor bill just to be given wrong information. I will NEVER take this poison pill again. Thank goodness I didn't have a stroke",1
"Since starting this medication I've experienced leg cramps, weight gain and increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  I exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.  Bone scans do not show improvement, may consider alternatives.",2
"Have osteopenia in both hips and borderline osteoperosis in the L5.  Cannot tolerate Actonel.  Took one Estiva yesterday midmorning w/crakers.  20 minutes after, I began to have tightness in the chest, nausea, swelling in the eyes, and overall shakeyness.  Had to tell my boss what I took in case she found me on the floor.  Symptoms continued throughout the day. Also had difficulty eating.  Was awake most of the night with nausea and stomach pains as well as pains in the chest.  Still shakey this morning.  Will not take it again today.  Double doses of milk and calcium  along with exercise will have to be enough.",1
"I have been on Evista for over 5 years and have had minor side effects. Some night sweats and leg cramps but not sure I can say the drug caused them. I have actually lost weight since on the drug. I had breast cancer in 1991 and had an abnormal pap smear at some point and that is when my doctor recommended Evista. I am 5 feet 5 inches, small in frame and haven't had bad side effects and only very minor bone loss in one of my hips. I have discussed the research with my doctor but she felt the drug was helping me. Due to all the different information, I am at a loss as what I should do in the future. ",4
I have been on Actonel for over a year.  Just had a bone density test and results are slighly worse.  Dr put me on Actenel and Evista.  About a month later I experienced nausea and unbalance in the legs (wobbly).  I've stopped Evista for tw weeks now but still have unbalance in legs.  Have read where people have pain but not unbalance symptoms.  ,1
 Depression major symptom.  Weight gain. Recent back pain when standing too long.  Headache and nausea.  Want to stop but worry about future bone fractures.  Can't take Fosomax or Boniva - caused gastritis.,2
"Due to osteopenia and osterporiasis, along with bad bone density tests, I used an estrogen patch for 16 years and because I was fearful of breast cancer if I continued use (even tho none in family) I stopped the patach.  My doctor agreed.  With  Evista I have sweats during the day but my night sweats are unbearable. I have leg cramps at night and last night it was horribly painful.  Thought if I could hang in there for 6 months the side effects would lessen but now am not so sure.  In addition I have Thyroid Disease and take Synthroid for that and Synthroid leaches calcium from the bone. Not sure what to do or what my options are at this point but I do not like these side effects.  ",1
Leg discomfort,3
"I have been on Evista for one year and not due for another bone density scan for another year, so I am not sure of its effectiveness.  I do have some night sweats, but also take another drug that has that side effect. They are not nearly as bad as during peri-menapausal stage. I have begun to have some occasional acid reflux and was researching this site to see if Evista might be the cause since I had not added any other new drugs in the past year.  Sounds like it might be.",4
"The potential benefits of this medication were overshadowed by a progressive stiffness in my knees which became more and more debilitating over the course of the year+ that I took it.  The symptoms disappeared when, at the suggestion of my physician, I discontinued the medication.",3
evista gave me gallstone highbloodpresser and mmy face was swolling,1
"My experience with Evista was not good.  I got  leg cramps, hot flashes and joint pain.  About a month ago I had a Mini Stroke while on Evista.  I think the bad reactions over take the good.",1
"Had osteoporosis (-2.6 T score) until Forteo injections. Score is -1.9 now. Doctor precribed Evista. Does not want me taking any more Fosomax, etc., which I had previously taken with no results. A pharmacist informed me that Evista is an estrogen blocker, so I discontinued it, since I am now taking Estradiol--due to the fact that they discontinued Estratest!  It may not have anything to do with it, but I am less depressed now without as many aches and pains, since I stopped the Evista.  Another doctor is wanting me to begin taking it again, so I have two different opinions.  All in all, the Forteo injections were the only thing that helped my osteoporosis change to osteopenia.",2
I have eregular hearth beath after 4 days of using . Is that related to this medicine?,1
"I found out that Evista is most dangerous drug I ever encountered.   Dr. put me on Evista February 2009 I was on for it 3 months and it gave me so much side effects just like it described, hot flash, sweating, or leg cramps, weight gain, sweating, constipation and bloating, muscle and bone pain, feet & ankle pain &burning, leg cramps, swelling lags, skin rash it never go away, finely high blood pressure. serious side effects occur I took myself off of it.  Since then I have high blood pressure stayed with me permanently till this day so the doctor put me on blood pressure medication.  I was doing some research on bone drugs, any of the bone drugs are bad for the bone, it will make the bone more brittle and break more easily.  I believed Evista is most dangerous drug to woman.    ",1
First I experienced nausea and insomnia. The nausea diminished. Then I had swelling in my leg joints and fingers. Extreme interruption in sleep. I had to go off of it!!!,3
I have only been on for 2 weeks and have constipation and bruising on my legs. I am trying to weigh the risks of the drug with the hopes of it actually preventing estrogen-positive breast cancer. I am stopping it today since the research has not been convincing enough.,2
"My Doctor prescribed Evista for bone loss. I took it for 3 months and was getting uncontrollable leg spasms. My feet would curl up, cramp and turn in and there was no way to get the muscles to relax. I gave it a year- a painful year- and finally took myself off it. If I have complications later from bone loss- so be it, otherwise my daily life was becoming unberably painful. Once off the drug for a month all the cramping symptoms are gone. In my opinion, this is a very dangerous drug.",3
"After reading all the reviews, I am quite concerned about taking this drug! I have taken Evista for 1 month with no serious side affects as yet with the exception of some indigestion. I do have high blood pressure, which I am taking medication for and high cholesterol. My bone density test is not due till the end of the year; at that time if there is no improvement I think I will quit! ",1
I only used this medicine for 3 days!The side effects were so bad I was in tears from the pain in my joints.I could hardly make it through the last day! I would never take this!!! I would rather live life active then in misery!This can't be good! To suffer like this headaches body ache.I couldn't sleep!If you take this be watchful for signs!,1
"I took Evista daily, with or without food, for 3 months with no problem. When I renewed the prescription I became violently nauseous the first time I took it. I waited a few days and tried again, same result. Waited 4 weeks to make sure nothing else was involved and when I took it this morning, was very sick again. Nothing has changed in my health or medications (only take Fosamax). The doctor has no explanation except to stop taking it. Studies, including Lilly's, show vomiting is a very uncommon side effect and I'm known to have a cast-iron stomach. Wanted to report in case someone else experienced this. I'm retuning them to Lilly for evaluation and they are kindly refunding the cost of the pills.",1
"Begin taking Evista 2 months since June 2009. I have hot flashes and night sweats. No leg cramps or additional joint pain. Breathing is starting to become difficult, but maybe due to asthma/allergies. Others commented on weight gain and I have gained about 10lbs, which was not expected since I eat very healthy with lots of raw food consisting of veggies/fruits eaten daily, steel cut oats and whole grains,organic soy/unsweetend yogurt, no red meat or pork, only seafood,fish and organic chicken. Will be following up with doctor in Sept.",4
"I have been taking this drug for 2 yrs. I didn't realize until recently that this very well could be the cause of alot of the problems I am having now. I am 54, diagnosed with osteopenia. I have gained 80 lbs in 2 yrs, and am now going to have total knee replacements. The dr. and I both felt my weight gain was because I quit smoking. I was having serious swelling and pain in my legs and ankles, so I was sent to an orthopedic dr. He says both knees are shot and need total replacement. I ran out of the Evista 1 mth ago and I do mail in, so I didn't get it in time to continue it. I began to notice the swelling gone in my legs and ankles. I am NOT taking this any longer!! ",1
"Took Evista for 2 weeks, on the second day I got  pain on the top of my tongue and glands on both sides of my neck got very sore even down my esphogas. Got worst and had trouble swallowing and one day it was really painful to swallow felt like my throat was closing.  Stopped the medicine now for three days and the pain swallowing is getting less.  I would not recommend this to be taken by anyone.",1
I have been taking Evista about 3 weeks so cannot give an accurate star rating in respect of effectiveness.  I developed osteoporosis probably a few years before the menopause due to weight loss among other things.  I have been experiencing indigestion for two days so I am stopping the medication.  I had gastritis for 5 months after taking alendronic acid for a few years and not recognising the digestive symptoms which I had had for some time.  It was very unpleasant and I have no wish to repeat the experience.  I too get the sharp pain in the chest which is not my heart but a digestive system warning sign not to be ignored.  I have no idea where to go from here.,2
"been taking Evista for 3 months; experiencing hot flashes, general body aches, pain in fingers, stiffness upon awakening, malaise.  Generally feel about 30 years older than I am!  Also weepy and un-motivated.  Thinking of stopping Evista to see if these symptoms are related to drug.",2
"When I started taking evista, I began to have terrible headaches - I could not think straight and aspirin did not help. I also began to have leg cramps in bed at night. I began to have shortness of breath real bad, too. I have weaned myself off the meds, and all of the above problems have gone away. I'm going to just take calcium with vit. D and exercise and let nature take its course! My doctor was even treating my shortness of breath with asthma medicines! Good grief, taking meds to combat the side effects of meds - patient beware. I'm glad I found this Web site and for all the folks who list their experiences. Thank you.",1
"I have been on Evista 2 1/2months I have weight gain 25 pounds,night sweats,legs swell,shortness of breath,very high cholesterol ,,arms itch,severely bloated,blurred vision,can't stand to long pain in legs and back so i can't do my job (hairstylist)also strokes run in my family and they say I have the symptoms now .I'm 44 and was in good shape now I'm lucky to go grocery shopping.I feel disgusted at my doctors. Im going to do it with exercise and nutrition. ",1
"I have had breast cancer and was given this drug as I was taken off HRT -- I took it for about a year and half--weight gain, thumb joint pain which was diagnosed as arthritis - had cortisone shot which helped.  I discussed with my oncologist and I'm going off.  I gained about 15 lbs while I was taking this medication - my doctor said it slows metabolism.  I do not overeat and I exercise but the weight came on anyway.  I will report back after I've been off a while to see how I improve.",3
"I have had no complaints during the year of taking Evista, however the dexa scan shows slowing but continued bone loss.  Not sure where to go next.  Cannot tolerate Boniva or Actonel.",2
"When I was diagnosed with very bad bone loss I was given Evista Oral.  Yes, I have had a few minor symptoms.  But I am extremely active, very young for 59, dancer, work out, live alone, have a great career, and plan on living a long long healthy life.  So, this is what I think, I am NOT going to react to every ""little"" side effect, I am going to PUSH THROUGH, and know that when I have my next dexa scan, it will be improved and the path will be planned for me to be upright and healthy.  ",5
"Since start Evista approx.6 months ago, I have notice quite a few changes. I have RLS (restless leg syndrome) which caused legs to ache, move, tingle or cramp after relaxing in bed at night but couldn't understand why I my feet and ankles started to swell during the day.  Right leg is consistanly aching. I have gained 24lbs. Most of the weight gain has been in the last 3 months. Gain 2 lbs a week for that last month. I usually stick to about 1200 calories a day.  I wasn't associating any of these symptons to Evista until I read the side effects and most of the reviews.  Will stop taking the medicine for a month and see if there is any improvement.  Thanks to everyone that posted their reviews. They have helped me and hopefully many more woman.",1
I have gained 16 pounds over 5 months taking this medicine and I have not changed my eating habits nor exercise level at all,1
"My doctor just prescribed and I am sensitive to meds in general with a lot of allergies and back/leg problems, and was concerned about all the warnings on the label.  The comments here have helped...I don't think I will take this med. It sounds scary. I can't take Boniva or Actonal because of Acid Reflux issues...Don't know what to do...",1
My hot flashes had returned worse than before the use of Evista,2
"After the first few days of using Evista, I had THE worst joint pain in my neck and shoulder areas. I don't know if or how this drug was responsible, but I ruptured a disk in my neck just weeks after using Evista. (Never had that problem before.) Don't use Evista anymore!!!",1
I have been taking Evista for atypical ductal hyperplasia for the past year.  Now I find out I have endometrial hyperplasia.  Can be caused by Tamoxifen but no clinical evidence from Evista. ? ,3
"severe hot flashes,leg pain",3
"Have been on this drug for 1 year and have gained 15 pounds. I have awful hot flashes, worse that when I went off hormone drugs. I'm going to stop taking this drug and see if I can lose this weight.",1
I've been taking Evista at least 8 yrs. and at my age am wondering if I should try some of the alternative calcium remedies as My dad had a stroke and a heart attack and died at the age of 57.  After reading some of the other comments I am wondering if my extreme arthritis in my thumb joints could be related?????????????,3
"If I have any of the side effects listed with this drug, they are also effects that may occur for many other reasons.  Cannot determine if Evista is the cause but I have been on this drug for many years and am now concerned about long term effects.",4
Since taking Evista for four months I have experienced weakness and tingling in my left arm and leg.  Now I am beginning to have tingling sensation in fingers and toes.  At a very cold track meet for my son one finger went complerely numb and had no color(like a cadaver). It took several minutes for the color and feeling to return.  At night I feel as if I am losing it with the tingling and heavy feeling in my arms and legs.Has anyone else experienced tese symproms?  I have stopped taking at my Dr's advice.,1
"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE USE OF THIS DRUG, BUT THE LAST FEW WEEKS ARE MAKING ME WONDER.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED ANNOYING PAIN IN MY RIGHT SHOULDER AND HIP PAIN THAT MAKES SITTING OR SLEEPING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM SLEEPING,  BUT LATELY I CAN'T SLEEP ON EITHER OF MY SIDES.  I'VE BEEN TAKING THIS DRUG FOR ABOUT 3 YRS., BUT NOW I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT AND SEE IF IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.   ",5
"Have been taking evista for roughly 3 months and have had hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain (10 lbs.)and terrible leg cramps in one leg. Called my doctor yesterday and he advised stopping this med. for 7 days and calling him.  I dont plan on going back on this med. at all.  Have osteopenia in both hips and plan on checking into doing weight strengthening exercises and weight bearing exercises instead.  Cant take fosamax or calcium due to kidney stone history.",1
"I am using Evista spray.  Spray upper arm each day,trading off of course, and so far have not had any bad results and think it helps with my hot flashes!",4
"My mother has osteoporosis so I had a dexascan and discovered that I had certain markers for the development of that same condition. My doctor prescribed Evista and I have taken it for over two years. My most recent dexascan showed great improvement and I am very pleased.  I have had absolutely no side effects but, then again, I have not really experienced any issues with menopause.  The additional benefit regarding the effect on breast cancer makes this drug a ""win-win"" in my opinion.  ",5
I'm 58 and stated this medication in Dec 2008 and so far I get horrible hot and cold flashes throughout the day. I've also gain unwanted weight. I plan on discussing with DR. other alternatives.,1
"This medication bothers my stomach, I have nausea after taking this medication that lasts all day into the evening. I even tried taking it before bedtime ---- nausea also.",1
After about 5 months on Evista (and having severe hot flashes) I began experiencing severe pain in my ankle.  Have been off Evista for 2 months and ankle pain is better but still there.  I have had bad side effects from Actonel and Fosamax too but did not realize the drugs were responsible until I stopped the drugs and the pains went away.  ,1
"I took this drug for almost 4 years. For the last 2 years I experienced high blood pressure (which wasn't treated), nausea 24 hours a day and fainting almost on a daily basis. I also experienced shortness of breath. They ran all kinds of test and couldn't find anything wrong with me. What a joke. I was taken off the evista. Then I was fainting on a dailey basis, I did not leave my home for a year. My husband had to do all the shopping. I woke up one morning fainted and had numbness in both arms. We called an ambulance and I went to a different hospital. Thank goodness I did. They kept me there until they found the problem. I now take medication for high blood pressure, for the nausea and for anxiety. They also found that one chamber of my heart beats slower then the other. By all the post I have read in here, I truely believe the evista was the culprit. I now have had to have a hysterectomy in order to take the estrogen I need to stop the bone loss. Cancer runs very highly in my family and it was the only safe way to take estrogen. I would not recommend any osteoporosis medications to anyone. I will never take any again.",1
"After five months on Evista, I developed an inflammed bladder and constant urinary tract distress. Urinalysis, blood work and CT scan revealed nothing. I researched the drug and discovered it can cause these problems. I stopped the drug and gradually I started to get better. After a full month off the drug, I am finally back to normal. The drug insert does document this possibility, but none of my doctors were aware of it. My reaction to Evista was serious and excruciatingly painful. I won't use Evista again.",1
"It works great for my Mom, but, we are looking for something cheaper that basically does the same thing.",5
"Began use of Evista in Aug. 2008 after breast surgery in March.  Had been diagnosed with some bone loss for a few years.  Also have anemia due to surgical loss of portion of small intestine.  Have noticed leg cramps a few times, but really can't say more than usual with the anemia.  Also notice a tiny bit of flushing when being pretty active, but nothing compared with those hot flashes of yesteryear.  My oncologist decided that Evista might be better for me than Tamoxifen.  I hope it continues as well for the next 4 1/2 years.  So far so good!",5
"My mom has been on Evista for about 2 months.  She began having cramping in her right leg.  Now she had a stroke. An MRI was done and the doctors found a blood clot in her right lung. I wen to her house to get her medicattion to give to the doctors and happened to read the side effects of this drug. The side-effects listed were, pain in the legs and possible fatal stroke, among others.  Now that I am reading these reviews I am positive the Evista caused her stroke.",1
Tell me why is drug like Evista make women gain weight,3
"I have been on Evista for 2 months. I have gained lots of weight, joint pain in ankles, knees, elbows. Muscle aches, especially in thighs. Hot flashes, bloated feeling in stomach and shortness of breath. I am very miserable. I dont know whether to coninue taking this drug for next 4 yrs or just quit on my own. How important is it to stay on it?",5
"My wife had double bypass surgery 10 years ago. A recent ""64 slice"" scan was performed and a blood lot found in her left lung.  Doctor order dopler on both legs and a large blood clot found in seft leg.  No history of blood clots, no brusing.  Doctor took her off Evista.  Certainly without proof and based on information contained in this site and literature with drug, we fee strongly about the  possibility that the drug caused the blot clot(s).",1
"I have been taking Evista for two weeks and I am having shoulder, knees and hip pain, horrible headaches, muscle pain all over and my left eye is red, I also have trouble sleeping and have stomach inflamation.  I can't take it any more.  I took Boniva one time(only one pill) a year ago and in less than 24 hours I was taken to emergency with a severe headache and neck muscle so stiff I could not lift my head from a resting position.

I have been taking Evista for five years (mother had breast cancer and half-sister had breast cancer).  I have noted no side effects.,5
" Approximately 30 days without Evista, and now taking again.  I believe I have found the cause of a persistent, serious itching problem. An itch that was so severe I sought treatment and inquired as to it being related to breast augmentation. I truly felt my plastic surgeon had damaged nerves leading to my arms. This itch was solely located on the front of my left arm, just below the shoulder. There was no change in skin color, no obvious reason for this CONSTANT itch.  I had not realized my arm had not been bothering me. About 2 hours after taking this medicine, the itch is back. Same spot same annoying itch",3
"I have been using Evista for years and have had no problems or side effects. I recently am off of it because it is so expensive with my other meds I had to take, but I am ordering it again and going back on it. Since being off of it I haven't noticed any difference in how I feel one way or another. Guess I am lucky. I am glad that it protects from breast cancer too.",5
"I took this medication for two weeks. I started to get pain in my legs that gradually worked into bad leg cramps. I also got ""charlie horses"" in the morning. This drug is not worth the risks.",1
"I WAS happy with Evista, no side effects the first year.  After the second year, I began to have terrible foot pain and insomnia.  Then, to my surprise, through a CT Scan for colon health, it was discovered that I have cysts, enlarging in 3 months, and fibroids.  I NEVER had fibroids or any other problems in the fertile years, I am now 63.  I wonder how many of us have cysts on the ovaries, which now I must have removed.  I believe there is a connection as Evista ""mimics"" estrogen.  Anyone else have this experience?",3
Anyone else had problems with swelling bloodvessels in hands and internally from longterm use of Evista?,4
I took this for seven days and had so much pain in muscles in upper thighs which moved into knees and ankles. stopped taking it after only 7 days. took over 2 weeks for symptoms to ease.This is bad drug in my opinion. I will report this to FDA.,1
severe leg crap,2
I took Evista for 6 months and was experiencing shortness of breath so was taken off of it... shortness of breath went away in less than 10 days... re-started and after one month I'm again experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue.,3
"I have been on Evista for 7-8 years. I have almost died with hotflashes. My sister had breast cancer so my GYN took me off of harmone. I have also had a hyst. I have been on Cymbalta for about 4 years, and recently got off. I have never been so sick from the withdrawls. I was starting to feel better, but still having some hot flashes. I read that was a side effect of Evista so decided to stop it to. I have been off for one week, and I am feeling terrible. NO energy. I have to make myself just get out of bed. My stomach hurts,I feel a little nausiated, and just feel terrible. I don't know if you can have withdrawls from getting off. If any one has had this problem please let me know. My E-Mail is [email protected]",2
"I have taken Evista for 3 years and have severe cramping,swelling and pain in my back and legs.My Dr.says its caused by my diabetes,but after reading these reviews I'm not so sure!I think I'll stop for a couple of weeks and see if there is improvement.Thanks so much to all who have shared your experiences here.",3
I have been taking evista for approximately 10 years.  About 5 years ago I starting developing pains in my legs specifically the knees which was diagnosed as arthritic.  Over the past year my right leg which has very little arthritis bothers me to the point of not being able to walk without pain.  I am very active and do spinning at a club 3x a week.  Heard that evista causes leg problems and stopped taking it 6 weeks ago.  Problems have problems have progressively lessened.  Spoke with GYN and she concurrs.  Hoping for a miracle recovery.,3
"I have been on evista for 2 weeks my stomach is severely bloated,I feel like I'm starting to get depressed,having mood swings,feeling very tired,no energy,I had a hysterectomy at 37 and now have osteoporosis.My grandmother died from severe fractures of the spine due to osteoporosis,I don't want to suffer like she did but don't think I can live with these side affects! I will just have to keep taking calcium with D and get serious about exercise! I'm going to stop taking Evista!",1
"After hysterectomy at age 47, plus later dr. advice to stop hormones due to mother having breast cancer, I was put on Evista after bone scans indicated Osteopenia. The 1st time I tried it, I had to stop taking it due to severe hot flashes.  Took nothing for awhile but was prescribed Evista again a year ago by GYN and Endocrinologist to avoid further bone loss. Have recently developed severe muscle pain in back, neck, and back of legs. After reading some of these reports, I will not have my prescriptiom refilled and see if pain subsides. Have appt. w/GYN soon to discuss this.",1
This medicine caused me to have chest pain with a trip to the emergency room and a night stay in the hospital.  Thinking I was having a heart attack.  Turns out this medicine burned my esophagus and now I have ulcers.  I am being treated for these ulcers now.  This is one of the worst treatments for bone lose.  DO NOT TAKE! ,1
"I am 59 and was advised to take evista due to osteopenia and high risk of breast cancer. I am in physically good shape.   FOUR DAYS after taking evista I HAD A STROKE!!!!   Doctors cannot find a reason for the stroke (my heart is good, etc).    I have been advised to stop taking the evista by my doctors.  I think that others should know about this ""coincidence""(?) and decide how important it is to them.  ",1
"I am 60, BRCA 1 positive and began Evista.  I am post-menopausal and have begun terrible hot flashes again with this med.  I also have multiple sclerosis and am worried about exacerbation due to increased body heat.  Any feedback?",3
"I was put on Evista after my hysterectomy following my breast cancer treatments. Through a Dexa scan I was found to have ostiopinia and was told by both my gyno and oncologist that Evista could help with both conditions. I've been using Evista now for 7 months and I am expericing increased joint pain all over. I will be folowing up with my oncologist to see if Evista may be the cause. However, the good news is I am in full remission now for 18 months.",3
"This is the 2nd time I tried to take this drug.  I am having a lot of pain in both legs. I am trying to find a natural remedy for ""borderline osteoporis"".  Pls advise",1
This medication caused chest pains with the possibility of gall bladder problems.  Have decided that the side effects of this medication are not worth risking my health further.,1
no problems at all.very easy to use once a day my choice.,4
Legs and ankle swelling,3
I noted no side effects after taking this drug for over 5 years.,5

"I started taking the this medicine 6 months ago, I go to all my doctor appointments and check ups, but the last time my cholesterol went up,I started having a lot of hot flashes, inmosonio, headaches, stomachaches, and I used to be a very very healthy person. Then suddenly I star feeling a my arms weird at night, until I have to suspend the medicine because I had a cloth on my arm, very very painful. This has happened to more people I know, so be very  careful and talk with your doctor about the risks.",1
"My doctor gave me this 2years ago.  I had to switch doctors, went to a new doctor (Gyno) I was told I should have never been put on this because of heart attacts and strokes run in my family.  I had to have a electro cartogram.  Part of my heart is beating slower, they dont know why.  I am thinking the Evista.  Does anyone have this problem.  Thanks  Blueyegirl",2
Hot flashes are worse than those associated with menopause.  I also experienced shortness of breath.,1
My Doctor recommended Evista for my osteopenia diagnosis and I have been taking it for 3 years...my latest bone density tests came back with no improvements..and my osteopenia was getting worse...I have just started Boniva 2 weeks ago....we'll see!!,1
"I suspect  blood clot in my eye causing double vision could have been caused by evista. this happened twice since i have been on evista. Doctor advised me to stop taking it. he says evista is not the cause, and to date he does not yet know what the cause is.",2
"since taking this drug, i have had charlie horses in my legs during the night, also bubbly feeling in my legs. ",3
"I have been on this several years had a new bone density, this is not helping.",1
"I have taken Evista for 8 years now and am thinking seriously of going off of it.  I have complained to Dr. about muscle aches,leg cramps for 2 years now.  I went off cholestrol meds because of same reason.  I have to find out what meds are causing this reaction.  Bone density tests in past have been very good. I have had no history of cancer altho my Mom & her sister both had breast cancer and lived 40+ years following surgery.",4
"Evista caused me to have extreme soreness in the muscles in both of my arms and in the tendons of my hands.  I actually tried it three times because my doctor recommended it so highly for prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer after menopause.  After evaluating its effect on my body for the third time, I have decided that I absolutely cannot take Evista. ",1
I AM EXPERIENCING VERY INTENSE PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM AND SHOULDER.  cONSIDERED MAYBE HEART PROBLEMS.  I AM A 47 YR OLD PRE-MENOPAUSAL W/ A FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER.  NOW AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS I AM NOT SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT MY HEART.  LOOKS LIKE THIS DRUG CAUSES MUSCLE PAIN.  I FEEL LIKE I'M HAVING A SEVERE REACTION TO AN INJECTION IN MY LEFT ARM.  HARD TO EVEN LIFT MY ARM.  I'M GOING OFF UNTIL I CAN MEET WITH MY DR.  not:  i've been on this med for 1 week only,1
"Took Evista for several years. Gradually developed gas, dizziness, and severe sudden attacks of nausea. Did not make the connection until I stopped taking it along with everything else and got well. I wonder if some of the other problems I developed during that time that have no known cause, are Evista related.",3
Would taking Evista for a long time cause pain in my knees.,3
"Have  been on Evista for two years following a diagnosis of ostiopaenia. Just had a bone density test and my density has increased, showing no signs of osteopaenia.",5
"Before I started taking Evista, I had very mild arthritis type joint pain in my hands. Since taking Evista, the pain has increased.  I'm going to see if it gets better after stopping Evista.",1
"I have osteopenia. Was on Actonel for 1-1/2 yrs. Had a bone density test. No growth of bone from medicine. Changed to Evista and prempro hormone stopped to prevent risk of breast cancer. (Evista contains bone and hormone medicine). Had another bone density test 1-1/2 yrs. later. More bone loss.  Dr. changed medicine to Fosamax, but it does not contain any hormone and I am Terribly Missing that part of it! Has been a couple of weeks since I stopped taking it and everyone around me IS A BEAR (grrrrr).  Of course, it's not me, it's them.  Need to F/U with doc.",3
I started taking Evista two weeks ago and now have a lot of pain in my knee.  I am going to discontinue use and see if this makes a difference.,1
"My mom took this drug for several years. She had breast cancer 15 years ago. According to doctors it was from premarin, hormone related. She found out last spring she has bone cancer and not long to live. Is Evista a hormone or form of one?",1
I have been taking Evista for three week now. It is now 3 am and I am up due to terrible pain in my knee.  I have had pain in my knees  and hips.  Not sure yet if it is from the evista.  I'm stopping it today and seeing if the pain goes away.,1
"After taking Evista daily for 4 months, I had to stop because body and muscle aches began to impact my daily life.I couldn't go up stairs or get up out of a chair without some serious hip and knee pain. I am not out of shape or overweight.I also experienced shoulder and middle of back pain that felt like it was ""in my bones.""",2
"When I was 27 years old I had to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis.  So I went thru a surgical menopause.  My Dr. did not put me on any meds for prevention of osteoporosis then.  If he had I most likely would not have osteo. so severely now.  My age now is 55.  I am angry that back then my dr. did not do that or recommend that I needed meds.  Now the dr. I am seeing has had me on Evista 60mg. daily for years and recently after my bone density and the other bone test, she decided to put me on Fosomax.  I had tried it before and cannot take it or Actonel due to acid reflux problems I have.  I went back on the Evista and just have to be careful not to stand too long or my back really starts to hurt. It is too bad that Dr's don't prescribe a drug for osteo if they are putting us thru surgical menopause.  They should know better.  Call me mad about what happened to me.",4
Have not started on Evista yet - is it safe to use as I had breast cancer l5 years ago.,1
"I was taking Premarin, my MD changed to Evista for added benefits of reducing cause of breast cancer.",5
"No side effects! I am very sensitive to any medications and must take all in smaller doses than most w/ elevated results. This medication shows no signs of use whatsoever, but, I feel stronger while using it. My bones do not creek as much after 2 weeks of use; I am very happy with this drug; no stomach upset w/ or w/o food. ",4
Had diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis. I have IBS and Actonel and Fosamax gave me severe constipation requiring enemas. I was switched to Evista and have had no side effects. ,4
It has been given to me for postmenopausal use for osteoporosis & post breast cancer treatment. No problems,4
"since I start using this medication, I have a lot of muscular pain.",3
"lobular carcinoma, mastectomy, chemo, peripheral neuropathy in 2006 at age 60. Began Fareston 2007 after 2 other Rx had side effects of painful joints.  Fareston was marginally better by taking 1/2 pill in morning; 1/2 before bed.  April 2012 I was declared cancer-free after 5 years on Fareston. Within 2 weeks my knee pain was better. Vaginal discharge is worse (at age 66!!) Hoping that will improve in coming weeks.",4
"Breast cancer hormone positive no lympnodes.  I have chills, hot flashes of about 8 where 10 would be unbearable.  I do take Calcium & Vit D supplements and an occasional Magnesium.",5
"I am 68yrs. old and have had rheumatoid arthritis for over 30 years and that is now under control, so I was adamant about not taking an aromatase inhibitor. I was given the drug as an antiestrogen for stage 1 breast cancer when I would not take any aromatase inhibitor.   I have been on it for over 3 months and have had no noticeable side effects.  ",5
I had taken several research drugs for a tumor on my chest from breast cancer. Many side effects with them.  My dr decided to do radiation and gave me this pill beforehand.  I took it for 3 weeks before beginning radiation and was amazed at how quickly it started to reduce my tumor. Took the radiation; still on the pill; tumor is gone.  Wonderful results with the drug.,5
"DO NOT USE !!! This will kill your liver! My mom had healthy organs, she took this for one week and suffered from liver damage. Two weeks later we are burying her. Stick with Revilmid and Velcade!!!",1
While I have been using faslodex it has been extremely good in blocking my remaining hormones after having ovaries removed however I have had a lot more pain than usual from fibromyalgia and spondylosis ect. I have noticed every time I have my injection I get a foul smell almost like burning skin around me and my urine is very dark in colour for a week or so after does anyone else experience this? I find it embarrassing as someone commented even though I had sprayed with deodorant and perfume/aftershave.,5
I was on this drug for 9 months and my tumor doubled in size. ,1
"Faslodex saved my life.  I was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast Cancer in July of 2011.  I was on a combination of Faslodex and Aromasin. After six years of great results, I had a bit of progression and replaced Aromasin with Ibrance. This week with be my 86th round of Faslodex.  I don't have any side effects with it and the shots do not bother me at all.  I don't know if I am just tough or that my nurses are just so good at the injections.  I would like to thank AstraZeneca for this amazing drug.  Because of it, I am here watching my grandchildren grow up, spending time with my children and enjoying life with my sweet husband. ",5
"Started treatment 4/20/15.  Tumor makers decreased sharply, but have since gone up slighlty and how now steadied for the last 4 months. Very encouraging. Have had bouts of nausea and times when I am too tired to move, but these pass and the good times outweigh the bad. I remain active, walking the beach in the morning and horseback riding on weekends. Have excellent nurses and have had no ill effects from the injections themselves or issues with the injection sites.",5
Have been on faslodex along with xgeva for almost two years. Hot flashes are horrible I wake up soaking wet most mornings. Insomnia is taken care of with medication. Fatigue and injection site pain. Get headaches. Symptoms vary month to month and I haven't been able to figure out anything that is different each month. Had metastatic cancer in my patella. Not found elsewhere so it's working. ,5
Has anyone travelled overseas with Vaslodex? I need an advise as I am going to be more than 6 hours in an airport before my next flight.,1
"After reading all you reviews I am convinced that my leg and buttocks pain is partly caused from Faslodex.  I have thought for the two years that I have been on Faslodex, that my pain came from Siatica from a herniated disc. Because my pain is mostly on the right side, it must from the disc also. The pain is so severe I really can't stand much more. What makes me mad is that I have been telling my onocology doctor about all this pain and he has never mentioned that it could be partly the faslodex. I have bone cancer right where the hern disc is also!  Thanks for all your comments, They helped me a lot!!!  ",3
"Dx is Stage IV, diagnosed Jan 2015. Started injections 2 x month with Faslodex + Xgeva. Suffering no pain ever at injection site. No side effects from injections either. C.T. Scan this week showed cancer has not spread. I am very satisfied so far; just feeling so very blessed.  No pain at all.",5
"To reduce injection site pain, I take 2 ibuprofen an hour or more before the shots, AND immediately before the injection, I take one dose of the homeopathic remedy arnica montana 30C. (A popular brand is Boiron - comes in a little blue tube. Buy it at a health food store.) Repeat either or both 4-6 hours later if necessary. ",5
"I was first diagnosed in 2005.  Stage 1 arimidex for 5 years, but cancer returned in biopsy tract.  Had mastectomy and chemo, then Tamoxifen.  Breast Cancer returned to my skin in 13 months, so had more surgery and radiation: total of 56 radiation treatments to my left side.  Took Exemestane for 2 years, but cancer returned to my right breast.  Only 1 positive node. Cancer responded well to chemo so I was downgraded/upgraded to Stage 2. A miracle! I have now taken faslodex for 3 doses.  Doing very well.  Have noticed cramping in my toes! Seems to improve with calcium/magnesium supplements.  Overall quality of life very good.  Concentrating on getting my BMI down to below 25 and exercising 150 minutes a week, per Dr recommendation. ",5
"I have been on faslodex Since July 2014. I had the loading doses for the 6 weeks. I will call this ""Breast Cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma Hell Weeks"" Now I am progressed to shots once a month now at the time of posting this by 3 months. These shots are not without side effects. I have battled cancer now 8 times in almost 40 years. I have seen worse treatments in the long run this is somewhat better then chemo or radiation. The injections are very painful. I can honestly tell you I can feel every bump for 2 min. My muscles instantly begin to cramp throughout my entire body. By the time I get home I can barely walk. They give me a low dose injection of morphine before the injections to help manage some of the pain and cramping. This cramping has gotten worse each month. The first shot I was in bed for a couple days now the shots put me in bed at least 10 day to 3 weeks. I have to say so far the body muscle cramping seems to be the worst. I will further explain what I am experiencing. Within a couple hours my whole body begins to shake fairly hard for about an hour or two. It is short lived. The last 2 months I have hives a rash that is now sores it itches terribly. I am having issues with a pressure feeling before I go to the bathroom now. It is almost a pain and it is a rush to make it as I am having issues holding it. Any of you experiencing this? I am kind of young for this to be happening. My legs go numb and almost give out on me at the same time I get really dizzy and almost pass out. I am tired a lot, headache, back pain; muscle pain; loss of appetite, constipation; weakness, feeling tired; cough, hot flashes/chills, use a beach towel to absorb sweat while you sleep and wake up dry. Fluid Retention in my Feet,Bad stomach cramps, fevers, Flu-Like Symptoms, mouth sores inside and outside of mouth. These are the main ones that bother me the most. I was told my last visit I have to stay on treatments now for life. I wish you all luck! ~ Dr Rev Lynn",4
"Original breast cancer in 2005, came back in 2012 started shots 1 year ago and all tumors are shrinking.  The shots need to be warmed up, if not the pain is 2 weeks.  My doctor and nurse are very good and careful to make me comfortable.  Shots are not fun but it is working I have cat scans every 4 months.",5
After the initial 6 doses in 1 month treatment the tangerine sized stage 3 tumor (metastic) has gone but cancer marker remains at 52.  Odd.  Pain at the shot site depends on who gives the shot and where.  I have been receiving 500mg each month.  Do raise the shot leg to relax the glut muscle. Yes I have joint pain but nothing else.  Good luck to us all!!,5
Have been on faslodex for almost a year. Side effects have eased with each dose . Only have soreness at injection site that is better with walking the day of treatment. My markers are almost normal now. Enjoying everyday activities and feeling good! Have been on several cruises and riding my bicycle.,5
"Flasodex has worked well for me except for the aches and pains in legs,ribs and headaches.I had a breast removed 13 years ago and was on 5 years of Femmara. Had the same sid effects with Femara. Had a chest xray 17 months ago and found out I had mets to the bone.",5
"I have heard of so many women having painful reactions to the injection site. Please work with whoever is giving the injection to you...they don't want to hurt you!  Make sure the Faslodex is at room temp,as it is thick when cold.You shuld be given a step up.  Put all your weight on your left foot,relax your right leg for the injection, and ask that it is given far from your psiatic  nerve. Your nurse will do the same with your left leg...please give a heartfelt thank-you, as you will be back in a month.",5
"About 5 years ago diagnosed with Stage 4 Her+ cancerous cells in R breast.  Had a R masectomy; and went thru 6 treatments of TAC; 6 weeks (15 mins. M-F) of radiation and then Arimadex.  In 1/2012 Pap smear showed positive cancer cells.  Went thru 6 more weeks of Radiation to harden womb and cervix, but no operation. Started Faslodex treatment 2 shots (250mg each syringe) in buttocks every 4 weeks.  We are now 8 months into treatment and Oncologist not happy with tumor markings.  Next visit will try a combo of drugs to bring numbers down. ",5
"22 years after first little breast cancer, it came back, now metastatic. Took Faslodex (clinical trial for dosage) which worked for 3.3 years with no side effects. Great stuff! I'm almost 72, now on chemo (5 1/2 years after second diagnosis - cancer characterized as ""indolent"" - but it's stubborn!) and still hanging in there.",4
"vomiting, trips to ER for dehydration, stomach pains and intestional pain, terrible constipation, lost 25 lbs that did not nee dto use bcz could not eat in 4 mos I took this - I decided Q of L not worth it + would have had other problems if continued losing weightI have stage IV ca but can't live like this - will see if there is another Rx - can't take armidex or Femara bcZ of osteoporosis - not good situation",1
"Diagnosed with estrogen-positive breast cancer in 2005.  Had a double mastectomy, chemo, and radiation after surgery.  Took Arimidex to remove estrogen from my system.  Was cancer free for four years before it reoccured with small spots in my liver and sternum.  Again I had chemo and my anti-estrogen treatment was changed from Arimidex to Faslodex.  Few side-effects for me although I may be attributing bone aches and feet problems to aging rather than the meds.  Yes, the Faslodex shots are a ""pain.""  Yes, the nurse can help by gently warming the shots to almost human temp.  BUT the painful knots that sometimes occur along with feeling bruised in the back hip area are still often there.  Try this:  At any store that carries pads that heat up when exposed to air (ThermaCare or Tylenol Precision) and put them onto the shot area IMMEDIATELY after the shot.  Yes, take them with you to the office when you get your shots.  Replace as needed for 24 to 36 hours and you'll find the shots and the aftereffects much more comfortable.   Stay positive and stay well.  Let's all survive and laugh in cancer's face!",5
"Lumpectomy/Radiation in 1987, and was cancer free for 25 years.  Cancer returned in 2008, same breast, same location. Had Mastectomy in March 2012, with complications; returned for surgery 3 weeks later.  Started Faslodex one week ago with bad reactions: Strong body odor-toxic smell, belching, nausea, headaches, swelling and bruising on left hand.  Must do soul searching to see if I should continue this treatment -- may need to research other alternatives.  Between 2008-2012 was taking Arimidex, it worked for a while but cancer markers started increasing in late 2011. God bless all cancer suffers; stay strong.  ",1
"I was DX with metastatic breast cancer to 3 lymph nodes in 12/11 after being cancer free for 4 1/2 years.  I started my first dose of Faslodex, 500 mg with no side effects except soreness at the injection site for a couple of days.  The nurse that administered the drug warmed the drug and I only felt a prick, not the deep injection.  The second dose was 2 weeks later and  I again felt only a prick with soreness later.  But I started having severe diarrhea with stomach cramps; my oncologist prescribed an anti-diarrhea which controlled that problem.  Then I had my next injection two weeks later with the cancer blood markers showing a HUGE drop in the cancer markers, down to the normal level.  It was such good news and gave us a lot of hope.  My diarrhea is gone; I don't have to take the anti-diarrhea anymore.  I now am on a monthly dosing schedule which I think is what has helped with those symptoms plus my buttocks appreciate the monthly schedule!  To relieve the pain from the injection I take Aleve plus I apply a heated pad alternating with an ice pack during the day of the injection.  I have also bought a infra red pad to alleviate the pain, but not sure how much it is helping.   I send positive thoughts to all undergoing treatments and I wish you the very best as you fight this hideous disease. ",5
"I have been on this medication for six years.  I have not had a recurrence of stage VI Metastatic breast cancer.  However, the side effects have gotten worse over the years.  I have joint pain and muscle pain, mainly at night.  I have gained a lot of weight.  I have high blood pressure and taking 4 different blood pressure meds, and I have developd Type II diabetes. I take Metformin for this new disease. I don't want to take this shot anymore.  Now my oncologist want to give me Aromasin.  ",5
"Since beginning faslodex (6 months), my PET scans are showing no activity.  However, my markers are still up.  I have noticed some SE: joint pain, some fatigue and sore, tender feet.  I have found that walking helps a lot.  When I walk in good shoes with gel insoles.  When I hurt, I want to not move, but not moving makes everything much worse.  ",4
"Orig diagnosis of bc 2007.  After lumpectomy etc, unable to tolerate aromatase inhibitors, but for 4 yrs all was well.  Then May 2011 I developed a massive pleural effusion and pneumonia, which put me in the hospital.  After several rounds of testing and draining fluid, finally found this to be the result of metastatic bc - microscopic cells in the pleural lining - so far as we know.  After much reading and research, I began faslodex in October 2011 - the results were virtually immediate.  The fluid around my lungs is nearly gone now, I can breathe again, tumor marker #s are down to below normal.  Yes, there is an odd skin sensation/sensitivity/pain in one hip/leg, but otherwise feel SOOO much better now.  I am wildly pleased with this treatment.  I am snowshoeing again at 10,000 ft altitude.  My family and I are VERY pleased at how well I can tolerate this treatment.  ",5
"Diagnosed with bc in 1999, had 4 chemo treatments, took tamoxiphen for 5 years, then femara for 5 years. A cancerous lymphnode appeared in my neck area in 2011, went through 6 weeks radiation, now on faslodex for the past 4 months, but hate the shots (one in each cheek, once a month). Also, have experienced pain in the hips and legs 1 or 2 weeks after injection. Begged oncologist for oral treatment and she has me on aromasin starting next month. Gosh, I hope it works well for me.",5
"My original diagnoses was 2001. Mastectomey and Arimidex until Metastatic tumor on L4 spine April 2010. Started on zometa and fasladex after radiation in May 2010. One shot per month and now receiving 2 per month. Not really experiencing any side effects. I may have pain at injection site, depending on skill of nurse. Warming the drug to room temperature helps and the injection should be done slowly. Scans are good so far. I am blessed!!",5
"I have had the first 2 injections. My doctor said I only get 2 injections the first month and then start once a month. Your website says I should be getting 2 injections 3 times, not two before starting the monthly program. I have matastatic liver cancer, one 3.5cm, plus 6 other smaller tumors. I had no problem with the 1st set of injections, but should I be getting 3 sets before monthly or 2 sets as my cancer doctor has directed. Thank you.",3
"Only had six treatments since surgery in May 2011.  Injections every 28 days and Herceptin once a month.  Going very well.  Soreness in the chest area up to the throat, slight cough but feeling great.  First pet scan due in Dec!  Breast cancer came back after 13 years on my ovaries, with a complete hysterectomy only a small spot was found.  I feel very blessed, I pray this is working and pray for all our warriors!",3

Just dealing with side effects and living my life!",5
"Took femarra for 2-3 yrs then cancer came back in my colon had resection have been taking faslodex for 2 yrs now.Started on one dose monthly,about this last yr they incresed it to 2 doses.My Dr. informed me that they were doing that to everyone on faslodex. I have had headaches,joint aches,nausea,diarea,kinda like having the flu.Small price to pay as long as it keeps the cancer at bay.This last yr,my tumer markers have been elevated so I have a PET scan every 3mos. my blood is loaded with the nasty little cancer cells they haven't landed yet!!!july2011 dx'd in march 2005",4
I have been on this drug for over five years after I sufferd extreme drug reactions to Femrra and Ariminsen,5
"Was placed on injection meds due to not being able to swallow,this has less side effects than arimidex, arimison and the host of pills I endured before, just requires a monthly visit to drs office(fair trade). Sleep better due to decrease in bone and muscle pain, doing well to control metastases--except for the one on my esophagus which has grown. First diag was in 2007, still fighting.",4
"After a few months on this drug my leg pain is so severe, I will be stopping the injections. Will be seeing my Dr this week. I have tried Femara, Zometa, and now this. Quality of life is severely affected and not worth it. I need help getting up out of a chair, my thighs and calves hurt all the time and after being up for a few hours my feet hurt too.",3
a couple of days I have joint pain and also vertigo-is anyone else experiencing this?,4
I went from hardly being able to walk to being able to drive and accomplish my household tasks with ease. Was able to go on a cruise now that I couldn't take at the start of my illness. Wonderful drug!!!,5
"I have had a double dose of Falsodex 3 times, that's 4 IM injections in the buttocks each month.  I bruise and it is really sore for about a week. I also experience my urine having a strong odor for the first week. I have a bad taste in my mouth too. I also have diarrhea during the first couple of weeks after injections. I feel like the tin man needing an oil can each time I get up after sitting or laying down for 30 minutes. After I get to moving around, I ususally feel better. I am most concerned about the fact that my arms, hands, legs, and feet keep falling asleep on me.  I am also getting Zometa infusion once a month too so I don't know which is causing more pain. I have had some headaches and nausea. I take Vitamin E 400IU BID for the hot flashes. I'm pretty sure that it helps because when I forget it, I notice flashes are much worse. ",3
"Breast cancer ER/PR+ diagnozed Oct 2000.Four Neo-adjuvant chemos before lumpectomy, 4 more infusions post lumpectomy. Six weeks radiation then tamoxifen, arimidex and disease free till March 2007, when metastatic breast cancer moved to ovaries. Full hysterectomy, doing fine till July 2009. Recurrence of breast cancer on small intestine. Re-section of intestine to stomach and clinical trial for one year with Nab-paclitaxcel and Avastin (Bevazumizab) infusions 3 times per month for 1 year. Finished chemo Aug 22, 2010.Feeling ok, hair coming back in again and neuropathy on fingers and feet slowly getting better. Loss of 55 lbs during past 12 months. After capsule endoscopy was notified of small cyst resurgence next to re-section site. Feeling good, went on vacation to Galapagos for 2 weeks. To slow/stop progression, Faslodex was suggested. First injection not pleasant but no major pain. A bit of a rash and itching on stomach. No other adverse reaction to speak of. After the last injection 14 days ago, I have a moderate rash on stomach, buttocks, back and upper arms and shins. Test also showed higher liver enzymes for the very first time. However the itching is absolutely insane. I do not function very well or sleep due to constant scratching. Do not think I can continue with this unless there is a pre-medication solution. To relieve itching/rash have been prescribed predinizone (steroid) and Atarax. Combination works for a while but after six hours, starting to need another dose of Atarax. Hive not going away, but instead moves to ears or head or arms and other parts of body. Am wondering if it will take full 30 days to get out of my body which is the time span Faslodex works through. All in all am a 10 year fighter and look forward to more time here. Just need another alternative to Faslodex that is also an ER/PR inhibitor with a tract record. I am lucky, turned 55, great supporting hubby and friends and great doctor and team. ",3
"Had about 4 injections don't have to take any more. Overall I did well on this drug, that last shot has been the worst, sick stomach, dirreah, joint pain. Just feeling real bad. Cancer free 5 years.",4
"After 8 months on Faslodex my CA153 marker has begun to edge up again.  My doctor and I are going to discuss a clinical trial. Some of the injections have hurt more than others.  I bruise easily, my legs are now very sore (at 8 months) in the calf and thigh area.  I have some trouble walking, and I think one foot is swollen.  I see my doctor tomorrow.  Time for something else.",3
"I have only been on this for 6 wks so far very few side effects. itching at site of shot, . easy to get small discomfort when given.hope it will work for me time will tell",4
"Hip pain, joint pain, nausea, arm pain, back pain. overall body aches everywhere.",4
"I am actually not the one taking this drug but my mother is. last cat scan showed thigns were stable but her markers were up. I dont know how high they werere, she dosent tell us everthing. they increased her injectiosn to 2 a month but at the same time. is this common for them to increase the dosage?",4
"Was on Arimidex for 2 years.  Cancer found in lymph nodes and also appeared on skin.  So, chemo started again, and after 5 months of different regimens that were not improving the breast cancer on my skin, started faslodex which seems to have totally turned the skin involvement around- it has retreated and has now almost completely disappeared.  My Dr. is amazed - wished we had tried it sooner.  Did not work well with Abraxane so now taking xeloda, and lymph nodes are clear once again, and skin still looks good - looks like we made the perfect match, finally (have gone through several drug combinations in the last 11 months).  The shots are miserable despite using yoga breath, especially now that I get two every month.  Other side effects tolerable so far - rec'd 11 doses.  Does massage really help?  I've tried ice packs.  Had some bad days lately - I think I'm worn out from the fight, but I'm hanging in there.  Markers are down - hoping for 2 clear PETs in a row - would be nice for a change though it probably won't change anything about my treatment.  Hope it never stops working.",5
i have just started my treatment with this drug as femara did not work cancer came back to rib.i have only had one injection. i would like to hear from others about thier time on faslodex.,2
Every other month I take the medication it seems to sit under the skin and causes a hard ridge at the injection sight.it itches really bad and seems to effect the entire buttock area.Other then this it seems to be working..I only hope that the medication is working thoses months...,5

"I have noticed general body aches. Arthritic in nature. As I do have arthritis in my spine and some fingers, I feel that the Faslodex has exsaserbated this problem, but I am alive and will cope with these problems gladley.It does not realy hinder my quality of life.I tolerate the injection  well.It is helpful to know others have experienced my symptoms.",5
After Femara and Aromasin which left me confused and forgetful.This seemed to be the perfect drug until the Joint pain became so bad I couldn't function. I will not be continuing hoping to find something else that will work.,3
"10 days past my second injection, after both injections, I have had bone and joint pain.  Most difficult for me to deal with is the uncontollable diarrhea, this month it occured on 2 day after injection, then again on the 5 day and now again on the 10 day. After two months I am ready to stop the injections.   ",1
matastatic bone cancer/ breast cancer stage 3b estrogen receptor positive. tumors on spine and left rib cage. had radiation on spine and ribs and helped very much. lidoderm patches have helped with rib pain and migraine headaches that occur after treatments. joint pain and hot flashes are helped with the use of aspirin.,4
"Severely painful joints in legs and hips, can barely walk some days.  This started about six months after starting the injections and have been using for 13 months.  Looking into other treatment options.  Not worth the pain to me!!!",4
"The pelvic, leg and joint pain is severe. walking is difficult, n/v is continuous. But still alive so that makes it tolerable",4
other than being alive and doing good with stage 4 breast cancer with mets i find that the shot hurts for a week or so but i can take it.I experience leg pain so bad and cramped toes that i some times want to stop the med ..i started taking faslodex 1yr and 2 months ago so if you see my friends im still here...good luck on your own journey and i pray for all of us,3
i had my second shot and the only side effect i have had is nausea for a week after for a few hours each day.,3
other than a sore injection site --no side effects---life with mild pain or no life --easy choice,5
I have just had one treatment so I cannot truly rate the drug as yet.  My first treatment was two weeks ago and so far I do not have any side effects that I know of.,3
"11 months.  Markers down so far.  Warming drug to room temp helps make it less painful.  Had cancerous tumor removed last month.  Long trip 75 miles to have it injected.  Joint pain, sore feet, skin and bones.  As others said I am still here, but the quality of every day makes one wonder if it is worth it.",3
"After a year of treatment, I continue to have a lot of pain at the injection site for a least 3 weeks after each shot.  I also have joint pain, my arthritis has flaired up and I have neuropathy type pain in my feet.",5
sometime injection is painful and lasts for days,3
"I have been using Flasodex for a while and the only compliant I have is having joint pain/aches. I'm only 24yrs old, already in menopause but I have life. Flasodex had helped my tumor markers go down so I'll endure the pain. ""I GUESS""",5
Second month of injection I had mild chest pain which went up to the throat area. This lasted for several days,4
"Treatment #10 - low platelet count. The itchy skin was probably not due to dry winter weather. 3rd week after treatment - easily bruise, slow clotting.",3
side effects,3
"I am in a protocol (Fluvestrant with Taselisib) and will begin Cycle 6 in about 10 days. My doctors tell me the cancer is 'stable,' so that's good, but I want it to disappear. There is a met to the skin, and, though the little tumors are less prominent, I am (still) waiting for them to disappear. I have learned to breathe deeply, focus on relaxing completely and do visualizations during treatment; that has reduced the pain while receiving the injections to almost zero. ",4
"I have only had my second lot of injections  , side effects so far Insomnia, sore throat, I am lucky. I am going to lead as normal a life as I can I will know more on Nv 14th ",4
I have taken this treatment for about 2 years. It is less painful if given slowly and warmed up. After taking it for long periods it became less painful for me. It has stopped my tumor growth and help me feel more healthily. I am glad I use it. I just wish it came in pill form. ,5
Started three days ago. I got itchy hives on my belly area and ankles. ,1
I just started  had my first treatment last week,2
"I received 4 months of chemo (4 treatments) and 4 weeks of radiation,(20 treatments plus a ""blast) after lumpectomy for stage 3 breast cancer. Six positive lumph nodes removed. I was declared cancer free and began femara 4 weeks after radiation. Other than severe hot flashes and night sweats, I have had no side effects from femara. Every day I take a pill  it is comforting to believe it is protecting me.  I am in my third year as a breast cancer survivor.",5
Metastatic Breast Cancer.   Shrunk 3 cm lung tumor.  No side effects.  NED for 6 1/2 years. First and only treatment for MBC.,5
"3 years ago DCIS stage 1, mastectomy on right side. Told I would need to take Letrozole for 5 maybe 10 years so that the cancer would not return.  Since my oncotype score was 9 with low chance of reoccurrence, no chemo. I took Letrozole daily for 3 years and worked through the many side effects. In January of this year they found breast cancer in my left breast, and although caught early, very aggressive IBC. This time the oncotype score is a 40 so I will need chemo in addition to the mastectomy...  ",3
"Have been on Femara (Letraxole) for more than 12 months.  Experiencing hot flushes, hair loss and extreme weight loss, loss of appetite - I am thin anyway so very concerned about this. I have noticed from the comments, no one experienced this. Fortunately no aches or pain. ",5
not sure reason #1 properly described my condition.  I had lumpectomy on my left breast.  the procedure involved  removal of at least 2 lymph nodes from under my left armpit. That was when I was 50 years old. My doctor started chemo and radiation treatment right after my surgery.   I was also put on Tamoxifen initially but it caused me to gain weight.  I then switched to Femara which didn't seem to have the same effect.  I was taken off Femara after about 2-3 years.  And that was 15 years ago :-)) ,5
"I was prescribed Femara to reduce the tumor size before surgery. The side effects were awful. Constant headaches, rotten taste in my mouth, weight loss, joint pain, and diahrrea. Before my surgery the oncologist said he wanted me on this for 5 years. 5 YEARS! I understand long-term side effects also include osteoporosis, which is already a concern in my lower back.   In researching the alternative drugs, they do not appear much better, and in some cases worse. I've already had a double mastectomy and am seriously considering stopping right here and exploring alternative medicine instead.  ",3
"have bc grade 3 in 2014 and have surgen in nov 2015,1 month radiation, take pill since feb 2016. so far not seriouse side effects that will affect my daily life. but do have side effect that i believe came from pill as i do not have these before, like joint pain, leg numb, eye blury, hair lost.so far all these are bearable. but when i read all these report i am kind scaring what will be in future. seems i do not have other choice as bc is hormone positive. ",2
I had a lot of the symptoms Femara can already. Only been on it for three months. I've had some extra bone pain. I've had mostly nausea and tiredness. I think I'm a little more depressed. I also had a joint injection recently for bursitis so it could be masking some side effects. Good luck to all. I wanted to tell the lady that takes NSAIDS can cause heart attacks and strokes...hope she reads this. ,2
Started taking arimidex after total left mastectomy in January for ductal carcinoma. The side effects were so severe that I had to stop. My oncologist changed my Med to femara. Been taking about two weeks and the side effects have started. I am having hand and jaw tremors. Anyone ever have that?  The hot flashes are really bad. It makes working difficult. ,3
"I was on Arimidex, but joint pain was severe.  I was switched to Letrozole.  I was good for about 2 months, then joint pain, fatigue, hot flashes, poor sleep, my cholesterol is up.  I will be speaking to my oncologist again.  I don't want to complain, but my quality of life is suffering.  I will stick it out if need be, in hopes that cancer never returns.",4
"Only on the drug for 4 months following chemo and a mastectomy.  Side effects didn't start for about 6 weeks into taking the drug.  So far I have had interrupted sleep, knee, hand, and foot aches.  Also, what I call malaise, my get up and go has gone.  But, if I keep moving, the pain eases, naps help with the interrupted sleep, and I push myself to do things and get out of the house and the malaise passes.  Good Luck to all on this drug and who are recovering from breast cancer.",4
"I was prescribed this for fertilty. Five days into taking this drug, my nipples began to hurt really bad and were very hard. I developed a lump in each of my breasts. My mammogram came back abnormal,  so the doctor scheduled me for a biopsy. I have never had an abnormal mammogram until now. The biopsy came back benign, but I know it was from this drug. Even with good BCBS insurance, I am out of $750 for this biopsy procedure. I would not recommend using this for fertility issues. ",1
"TWO DIFFERENT CANCERS SAME BREAST! 2008 Diagnosed with Mucinous Carcinoma left breast, ER/PR/Her2+; Lumpectomy, Radiation & Tamoxifen for 5 years. In 2014 new cancer in Left Breast: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER/PR+ Her2-; Bi-lateral Mastectomy, Reconstruction of both breast, started 3 years of Lupron shots and 3 years Femara.  So far, (now October 2015) bone pain, joint pain in wrists, knees and ankles, hot-flashes, and overall not well feeling, shoulder pain, trouble sleeping, short term memory troubles, depression. I am starting a stretching program asap and when I feel a little better (hopefully soon) will start strength training.  Not happy about the side effects or either Tamoxifen or Femara.  Onco says joint pain is from Femara, and the once a month shot of Lupron accentuates those side-effects.  Asked my Onco what treatment I would go on if I couldn't handle these side-effects and he stated there is no other treatment for my cancer. ER/PR+ Her2- JOY!  Will work with this until I can't.  Changing lifestyle big time!  Pink Warrior has shown her face!",4
"I am writing to advise the people who are using generic femara (Letrozole) that it can be purchased at Costco warehouses for $16.39 instead of a whopping $350 - $700.  You do not need a membership to use the pharmacy and even if you did, it would be well worth it.",5
"I have been on Femara for almost two months after I was diagnosed with stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer. I have noticed tissue changes in the lump in my breast which seems to show an improvement. I have had bone aches and pains, nausea, hair loss and I do not know if the drug caused depression or if being told I had stage 4 cancer. I do not like the side effects but am also receiving a shot xgeva for adding calcium which could be part of it. I am still here which is what is important.",4
"Whew! I have completed five years of of estrogen blockers! I am looking forward to getting rid of diarrhea, trigger finger, joint pain, and other side effects. I feel the benefits of this drug outweigh the side effects though. Hang in there! Life is worth the struggle!",3
"I was diagnosed in February 2012 with grade 3 invasive breast cancer. I went thru chemo, complete mastectomy, and 32 rounds of radiation.  I started taking Femara July 2012.  a recent PET scan showed no signs of cancer.  I did have problems with fatigue,  muscle and joint pain.  My doctor told me that exercise would help the fatigue and pain.  It did.   ",5
"I have been taking Femara for 4 months and it has put me through Hell.  I had HER2 receptive breast cancer, lumpectomy, chemo, radiation and Herceptin treatments.  Now on Femara which is worse than all the surgery and treatments following surgery.  I can't sleep at night, have severe pains in the joints of my legs and back, have neck pain and an overall feeling of discomfort.  never wake up in the morning feeling refreshed or invigorated.  I feel like a 100 year old woman, or let me correct, the 100 year old woman probably feels better than I do. I am also experiencing hair  loss.  Wasn't six months of being bald enough.  I swore I would never wear my wig again but who's to say!  When my hair grew back is was thick and curley - I have always had straight hair.  I thought it was wonderful until it started to fall out.  I called Novartis to tell them about my symptoms and they had no advice regarding Femara.  What I don't know is what to do next.  Stop taking Femara or continue and be miserable for the next five years.  I am 67, active, working and just don't know what's in store for me.  Hope you are all doing better than I am.  Good luck and God bless to all of you.",3
"I will complete 5 years January 2015. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis so it is hard to tell what is causing problems. Side effects: bone and muscle pain, tiredness, major hair breakage and loss which started last year, bone loss/osteopenia (get a bone density every year, lift light weights 2-3/week, and take calcium with vitamin D if you can),increased cholesterol- dose increased, and general body aches. I am cancer free so I am willing to put up with side effects. I exercise for 2hrs  3-5/week. ",5
"I just finished 5 years of femara treatment.  Diagnosed with stage one, received lumpectomy and brachi radiation.  Am currently cancer free.  Big hugs to all my sisters out there wrestling with side effect vs quality of life choices.  I can tell you it wasn't easy at the beginning because of the side effects, but they did lessen for me over the years.  Of course now it all seems worth it.  Remain patient, and be comfortable with the decisions you make.  Gos bless.",5
"Mine was Stage IIA breast cancer, I had a lumpectomy, followed by chemo, then radiation.  Immediately following, was put on this drug.  I have experienced intense hot flashes, severe insomnia, forgetfulness/fuzzy brain and bone pain. Feels almost like the bone pain I experienced after a Neulesta shot following each chemo infusion.  Feels like the flu, have to remind myself it is from taking this drug.  The insomnia is all over the place, trouble falling to sleep, then staying asleep or waking up too early, have tried about everything except sleeping pills which I really don't want to get started on.  After about a week of this, I usually get a night or two of rest, guess it's from sheer exhaustion.  Hard to work though on 4-5 hrs sleep a night.  3 1/2 more years and hopefully, will not have to ever take this drug again.  Just looks like someone could come out with a drug without so many side effects.",3
"I was diagnosed with Stage 1 node negative breast cancer in 2004 and put on Femara. I took it for 15 months even after the side effects had made life miserable. I still have the side effects, including being dependent on a Rollator to get around. I had a long talk with my internist and decided to go off it. I am a ten year survivor and without medications. My oncologist soft pedaled the side effects and that undermined my trust in her judgement. I warn new BC patients who are put on it that you may have to grill your doctor about the problems. All they can see is the prospect of no recurring BC. This is all well and good but you have to live with your decision -- hopefully that will be a long time -- and you cannot ignore quality of life issues.",3
"After having BC Er+ DCIS right breast removed, Stage 3a, 6 months chemo, steroids, day after shot, 2 months radiation, tamoxifin for 2 years, now doctor put me on Letrozole 2.5mg. Have taken for 2 days, horrible side effects, rash, hand & leg swelling, bone pain, feel like I am on chemo again with the day after shot :( small headache, rash, aches & pains, dizziness, blurry vision and small heart palpitations. After reading all the comments and horrible side effects I will not continue this medication. I would rather have quality of life than endure this. I am 46 years young. ",2
"I have been taking Femara for over 7 years.  I had recurrent stage 2 breast cancer because of mistreatment and diagnosis (first 2004, then same cancer after chemo 2007).  Initially diagnosed as non estrogen was really estrogen receptive.  Some bone loss, some aches and sleep disruption.  I have never felt depressed or anxious, actually have felt this drug has evened out my mood through the elimination of estrogen spikes.  My doctor believes I should stay on drug as long as I can tolerate and I agree.  Exercise helps deal with any aches.  Overall, I have not felt or dealt with any truly negative side effects, and would highly recommend this drug as adjuvent therapy.  Also some sleep disruption but don't know if it is the drug or my age!",5
"Am serious 60 year old athlete.  Have foot pain,shoulder pain.  Stiff upon rising from chair.  Also have hot flashes,but had them before.  Negative dreams, depression, may be from just dealing with having stage 4 cancer.  Cancer free for now.  I can put up with side effects unless hair goes.  Am OK right now. Could not handle being an ugly gargoyle again.  I think I read Femara gives us a 37 percent better chance of survival.  Guess it is worth it for now.  My advice-keep moving.  I run or hit the gym every day.  I refuse to let anything stop me.  Keep the attitude girls..  I am pulling for all of us.",4
"I suffer from a lot of joint pain, dizziness and weight gain",3
"When I first started taking Femara, I had joint pain - bad! But my body slowly adjusted and I had to accept that it was going to be uncomfortable at times. Keep active - even when you don't think you can move. Four years into it, and I'm doing good. Take it! You will never be the same as before you had cancer, but it will be something you can LIVE with.",5
"ALL YOU LADIES OUT THERE WITH THE PAIN AND MEMORY LOSS AND ALL THE OTHER TERRIBLE AFTER EFFECTS FROM FEMARA.  TELL YOUR DOCTOR YOU WANT TO SWITCH TO EXAMESTANE (AROMASIN)IMMEDIATELY...  IT IS ONE OF THE OTHER TWO ESTROGEN INHIBITORS THAT STOP THE ESTROGEN FROM BEING PRODUCED BUT DOES NOT I REPEAT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE TERRIBLE AFTER EFFECTS.......I AM A FOUR YEAR SURVIVOR AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PAIN, THE MEMORY LOSS, THE NUMBNESS, YOU NAME IT AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THAT WITH EXAMESTANE......I TOOK FEMARA FOR SIX MONTHS AND MY QUALITY OF LIFE WAS TERRIBLE AND NOW FOR THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS I HAVE BEEN ON EXAMESTANE AND HAVE NONE.

"November 2008 diagnosed with Stage 2B breast cancer. Hormone receptor positive and HERS 2 positive.  Opted for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy. Received chemo, radiation and Herceptin therapy.  First 2.5 years was taking Tamoxifen then switched to Letrozole (Femara).  Last visit to oncologist stated I am cancer free and will be able to stop medication in May 2014.  Side effects have been joint and muscle pain with fatigue. Have been working out 1.5 hrs. 3x per week.  This has helped with most of side effects.  I take the medication at night and believe this has helped also.  I am determined to finish the 5 years and look forward to not taking this medication.  Has not been easy but do not want a reoccurrence of breast cancer.  Going through the breast cancer treatments were worse than the side effects of Tamoxifen and Letrozole.",5
It has caused me to have two crown replacements from bone loss.,1
extreme fatique,5
"Quality of life on Femara is a bit depressing but the alternative is deadly. I met someone who is on Norspan patches for joint and muscle pain so my doctor put me on 20g It stopped the hot flushes by 90% but still have a bit of pain, insomnia depression etc. It is 3 years now and I will continue to take Femara as I want to live. Simple as that.",4
"I guees it is working as I have had no recurrence 4 years after diagnosis.  I had 6 rounds of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation, continued on Herceptin for a year, then started Femara. I feel pretty fortunate after reading the other reviews.  I did have severe joint pain, but couldn't take prescription pain medicine because it made me even sleepier than I already was.  After 18 months my oncologist recommended Osteobiflex and I swear by that stuff.  I also take Effexor, woman's one a day, B12, Vitamin E, Vitamin D-3, and 4 Aleve a day. Hopefully, I'll still have a liver when then is over.  Also stool softeners because Femara has plugged me up. I run 10 to 20 miles a week and it seems like the more I move, the better the joint pain.  My brain definitely is not functioning like it did before.  I'm glad I read the other reviews and saw 'brain fuzziness' several times.  That gives me hope that I'll go back to normal when I get off this stuff. I have a lot of fatigue and also have the vaginal dryness. My husband is amazing and my boss doesn't fire me for taking naps at work and my Savior, Jesus Christ, lifts me up each day. I am on my 37th month of taking this drug and won't take it one extra day past 5 years.  Every time I empty a bottle, it's a celebration.  Good luck to all you fellow sufferers and 'run the race with patience', as it says in Hebrews 12: 1-3.",4

"6 months into a 5year sentence. Joint and muscle pain. Sleeplessness, I take over the counter sleep meds and alieve. Glucosamine and CQ10 help the joints. Sam-ee helps the depression and joints as well. I am trying to figure out a fix for the edema. My rings and shoes don't fit. I bought more shoes, but I miss my rings, and it can't be good for me to be doing this to my body. get my generic femara from Costco and pay $18. For a 3month supply. You can order online and have it delivered if you don't have a store nearby. I hope everything goes back to normal when I am done with this drug.",1
I really didn't have much side effects. The first 1-2 days a very slight headache and very little muscle ache. After that smooth sailing.,5
"Diagnosed with BC 12/28/12; Unilateral left breast mastectomy;4 rds chemo; 25 rds. radiation; Tried Arimedex for 3 weeks thought I was dying. Had every single side effect and then some. Was switched to Femara; Now its instant joint pain I hips, knuckles, ankles; have developed a huge hunger, I was worried I was getting diabetes from the hunger side effect, can't sleep, can't stop sweating, so tired that I can't go to work. Seeing the doc tomorrow, I had Osteopenia going into this, was just diagnosed with Osteoporosis, so I don't know what he's going to recommend. My mom had osteoporosis, I can't go there. Her bones were literally turning to liquid. I had a score of 19 on the Genomic test, so I have a 12% chance of this coming back.  I only had a 1.7% chance of getting cancer and I got it so these statistics are guidelines that drive me crazy.  The real problem was the hormone replacement therapy.  That's why I got breast cancer.  They have been lying to us for years.",3
"I have been on Femara for 4 months.   Felt great for the first two months and then the side effects set in.   Major depression (had to be put on an anti depressant), total loss of libido and terrible pain in feet.",4

I'm a marathon runner used to aching joints but this drug made my hip, knees, ankles and feet hurt so much I could barely stand up after a meal let alone run.  My doctor told me to hang on for another month when the symptoms should plateau..plateau?? to what state of awful? I told him that if the symptoms got any worse, I wouldn't be able to get out of bed.

"I had lobular breast cancer in my left breast and had a mastectomy in early 2010 and have since had a reconstruction. I have been on Femara since April 2010 with limited side effects although I do have some aches and pains. Am keeping a careful watch on my cholesterol levels and have joint and muscle stiffness but regular pilates and walks really help and has made it very manageable, I treat hot flushes with the odd acupuncture session which has been scientifically proven to help.  Overall, I exercise regularly, watch what I eat and try and stay positive, I have 1,5 years more to go on Femara and am already worried about coming off it as I do feel it helps prevent recurrance.  I have a wonderful Oncologist who is very supportive and kind.",4
I have experience tightness and pain on my shoulder and back,4
"I have been on Femara for 1.5 years so am not sure at this point how effective it is.  I did not have chemo or radiation.  The biggest side effect I have had from this drug is terrible insomnia.  I sleep approximately 3-4 hours a night and am extremely exhausted during the day.  Fortunately I am not working outside of the home since I would not be able to function in a job with the lack of sleep.  I do exercise a couple of hours every day which I think has helped with preventing major joint pain, although I do have some stiffness getting up in the mornings or out of a chair.  Also, despite a vegetarian and low fat diet my cholesterol has sky rocketed.  Have also had some hair loss.  I am afraid of the long term effects of this drug but my oncologist says it is the best thing available at this time. I really do hope the side effects are worth it  in the end.",4
"After 4 years taking this drug, my hips, knees and ankles ache.    I would love to be able to stop the pain",5
"I had stage 2 breast cancer, a right breast mastectomy (surgeron in November, 2011), CHT Chemotheraphy, and 35 days of radiation. I've been on the generic form of Femara for 5 months. At first, I ""only"" had joint pain in my knees. This last month that has increased to joint pain in my knees and hips,fluid build up (I can rarely wear my wedding ring), weight gain (despite really watching what I eat and exercising), and I have insomnia. My doctor chose Femara for me, because he said that, among his patients, it has the fewest side effects. Prior to cancer, I was healthy, and was not on any medication except for a daily vitamin. I am trying to stay active, and to not let this drug rule my life. I think it would be a mistake to stop this drug, despite the side effects.",3
"I am a 2x breast cancer survivor, diagnosed with the second 2 1/2 years after the 1st cancer all the while taking Femara.  I had a lumpectomy and 30 rounds of radiation after the first cancer.  I did not have chemo because I had the Oncotype DX breast cancer multigene expression test that determined my chance of ever getting breast cancer again in my lifetime was very low, wrong!  I have now been on Femara for 4 years and I don't believe I have suffered any side effects that don't come with being postmenopausal anyway.  Talk to any postmenopausal woman to see how they suffer.  I will continue the Femara as long as my Oncologist recommends for she is the expert.  My best advice is to join a gym and take some group exercise classes, you will feel better and be happier! ",1
"I've been on Femera since July 2009 and this is what I have been experiencing; hot flashes, severe muscle and joint pain, headaches, depression, insomnia, decreased vision, weight gain, acid reflux, nausea, and sex drive is nonexistent along with vaginal dryness.  I was diagnosed at 48 and I'm now 52 and feel 82. I have 8 months left and I'm considering stoping this medication.  I'd like to know if these side effects are permanent and if not how long will it take to feel like myself again.",3
"Have been taking it for a year now. Having slight joint pain shooting down to big toe occasionally at night, having sleep problems the last few months and more hair loss in the last month or 2.

"I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer (Stage 2b) in 1999 at age 42 with 7 of 14 nodes positive.   I expressed 4+ heur2neu and had a very aggressive grade of cancer.  I had a bilateral mesectomy (prophactic on the right, modified radical on the left) two rounds of Chemo and 26 radiation treatments. After radiation, I was placed on tamoxifen for 4.5 years and then was switched to Femara due to abnormal pap smears and bleeding. I am still on Femara 8 years later.  Both my mom and aunt died of Breast CA-all of us diagnosed in our early 40's.  This drug was not around for them, among drugs that have been approved since they passed away.  I have had osteopenia from this drug, but took calcium supplements, was placed on Fosamax and walked like a fiend and have improved my bone density, so have stopped the Fosamax.  My bones and muscles and the everyday walking helps the aching and controls the weight gain.  I take the drug at night, which helps a ton.  I take Aspirin or Aleve for the joint pain which helps, too.  The best part is that I am 14 years from my diagnosis and wouldn't be here without this drug.   I watched my mom battle this disease for 19 years without all of the options we have today.  Recurrence is NOT better than being on this drug.  Eat better, walk at least 30 minutes 5 times per week and know that while there are rough days...at least you're around to have them be rough.  I have traveled the tough road and know how hard it can be, but have also watched first hand what happens when you're out of options and the road ends.  Hang in there-it does get better-life is so sweet!",5
"With Stage 1 and zero (small lump, caught early) breast cancer, thought I was golden...until they found cancer growing into blood vessels of my lump. PAMF oncologists tried bullying me into chemo..until the ""Onco-type DX"" (cancer genetic test) showed only a 1% increase in protection. So now 6 weeks or radiation, and the ""no-brainer"" 5 years of a little pill. This was supposed to be the easy part.  Arimidex first.  No libido, spitting constant cotton balls...swelling of inside of mouth and tongue (kept biting tongue and cheeks.)  Constantly ill with bladder infections that morphed into chronic urethritis.  Also bright red, very hot hives on face, neck and hands.  So Dr. moved me to Femara. I purposely did not read side effects so I wouldn't be influenced.  Also since it took 2 months to rid my body of its hyper-sensitivity to nearly everything at that point...I was skeptical.  6 weeks ago started 1/2 Femara pill three times a week. After reading these posts, I now know why my 20-year old carpal tunnel surgery is now failing me.  Extreme hand pain and fingers popping in and out of place with yelps from me at every painful pop. Feet look like balloons, hives are back, but expanded to whole body. But the most frightening effect, not heretofore mentioned, is my sudden feeling or RAGE.  I drive home from work gripping steering wheel and roaring with it.   Its all I can do to control it when I'm not alone. God allowed my cancer for a reason...I was able to find a remedy for radiation burns.  If he allows it again, there will be another reason.  But if it took my body 2 months to recover from 2 months of these drugs, how long will it take to recover from 5 years of it.  The ""gift"" of urethritis will no doubt still be with me...I'm not giving it any more chances to ruin the health I have left. I had already decided to stop taking this awful pill, and intend to tell my oncologist that tomorrow.  I came to this site looking for validation...and found it.  Thank you all.    ",1

" Sept 2012 a little nodule in my lower lung was found that was growing  12 years after having a double mastectomy and stage 4 BC in 2000. This is my 3rd recurrance of BC.    The cancer came back in my HEEL BONE 2002. Surgery, radiation and tamoxifen worked well with very little side effects.  They do not seem to want to give Tamoxifen now, it gave me cataracts and I had them fixed. I have had 10 years of health, now at 68 this new stage 1 BC in my lung. I have estrogen pos CA.  I used estrace, it contains estrogen.  Is there a connection? I have taken Femera for 8 months, it, like all its classmates is terrible for the side effects.  Joint pain in my knees so bad I had to take a wheel chair to get on the airplane this Christmas. I had horrible fatigue, night sweats and most of the other side effects.  It is not worth taking Femara,we do not even know if it will cause the BC to go into remission and stay that way.  No quality of life with Femara . Another year wasted to a cancer drug.  I will take radiation instead or take my chances. Good luck with decision making!  For my part Femara is not worth the pain and suffering it causes you and your loved ones.",5
I am very unhappy with the side effects that I am experiencing with Femara: 1) extreme fatigue 2) joint pain 3) brain fog 4) interferes with sleep 5) mouth sores 6) weight gain. Are all these symptoms from Femara? I do not know.,5

"I ended up in the ER and needed surgery because of Femara.  I am pissed.  Femara caused many symptoms, including: dizziness, rapid pulse, vaginal bleeding, hair loss, blurred vision, bone and joint pain, and uterine polyps (which I needed surgically removed because they were symptomatic).  I regret taking Femara.  I filed an adverse advent report with the FDA and I'm pissed at my doctor for giving me this drug with no warning and then when I did experience side effects he said there was ""no way"" it was the Femara.  Surprise.  Surprise.  The side effects I listed are all over the web.  What a jerk.  Femara was a nightmare.  It cost me a lot in time, pain, and money for surgery.",1

When I switched to Letrozole- pink tablets from Mylan labs - no additional side effects. Then I was given Letrozole from accord labs- a yellow pill and within 3 weeks started to get very bad knee pain. I switched back to the pink pill, knee pain went away. I few weeks ago my prescription was filled with the yellow pills again ( didn't realize til I opened it)- and again after 3 weeks knee pain is back.  If anyone else has had a similar reaction, I'd love to hear about it. Seems odd, but I'm very convinced.",4

After sitting at work, pain in feet when getting up to walk.  Oncologist suggested trying Arimidex.  After one month, it was worse than Femara.  Dizziness, headache and still severe joint pain and inability to sleep.  I think I am going to discontinue all of these types of drugs and take my chances.  My quality of life is terrible with this drug.  Even excercising does not help enough.  Cancer is hell but so is this drug.  I don't think I can do it for five years.

Swimming and walking helps me keep going.  Hoping I don't have to take anything else after this but I'll worry if I get the ca again.  I'll just have to try thinking positively.  My husband is in great shape and acts like a man of 40 and I act like a person of 100.  I should go on the ""cancer"" diet which works, I just need self discipline...no sugar, no caffeine, no white products, no red meat, no dairy but eat organicly and do some juicing with fresh organics.  I did that 10 years ago when I got diagnosed after lumpectomy and radiation and lost 50 lbs just trying to eat healthy, not trying to lose weight, but that was before Letrozole.  Wishing everyone great health and to be cancer free!!!",5

I chose not to have radiation   Six months after my second surgery I started the chemo and have been on Femara since.  I found that if I take it before bed, my symptoms are less noticable.  If I take it earlier, I am so sore and achy that I can hardly move.  I also take a powdered vitamin which seems to help.  I try to work out on a treadmill or exercise bike daily. I have spent time hiking and mountain climbing.  The more active I am the better I feel.  I will not let the side effects of this medication rule my life,  I will find whatever it takes to beat it.

"I had stage 2 breast cancer and had a partial mastectomy in Aug. 2010. Went through chemotherapy and radiation therapy until Feb. 2011 and has been on Femara since then. In the first 6 months, the side effects were bearable. Then I began to feel depressed. My family doctor prescribed me with ""Sertima"" which helped a lot. Then the bone pain got worse, insomia, frizzy mind and bad memory. I tried to exercise but could not last and I lost interest in doing many things because I couldn't focus. I began to gain weight. My knees, neck and shoulders pain got worse especially in the morning when I got up. I went to Thailand for vacation with my family last month and found that I had just about the same energy as my 85 years old dad who is 30 years older than me. I took 1,200mg calcium with D3 and  Gluocosamie with no improvement. I was desperate and wondered how I could continue the pill for another 4 years. Then a friend who is also a breast cancer survivor told me to try taking ""Magnesium"". She said calcium has stiffen our blood artery and joints while magnesium can help to soften it. It should be taken in 2:1 ratio with Calcium. I tried to take two 250mg magnesium. In just one day, I felt the knees and shoulder pain lessen by 40%. I checked out ""magnesium"" on WebMD and found that it can help with insomnia, constipation, leg cramps, headache...etc. Now I have more energy, less bone pain and sleep better. My doctor said as long as it helps me, it doesn't hurt to take it. I hope this information can help others. I went for my annual examination last week and I am cleared of cancer.      ",3

"I was diag 4/08 w/stage II hormone receptor positive breast cancer; I had a lumpectomy, followed by 6 months of 3 different chemos and 37 days of radiation. 2/1/09 My Dr. prescribed Aromasin, extreme joint pain; then Aromostat, joint pain no better and after 4 months my Dr switched me to Femara. The joint pain was there but not as severe. The neuropathy is very bad and getting worse and I've been blaming it on the Taxol (the 3rd chemo)however, after reading other reviews it may be the Femara. I have many side effects - can't sleep, weight gain, ache in every joint, thin hair, etc.  The soles of the feet hurt and I cannot walk very far before my hips and legs ache very badly. I'm going to try the generic of Femara (Letrozole) this week, only because I can no longer afford the Femara. My insurance carrier doubled the cost of my co-pay this year (several hundred dollars for a 90 day supply). If I cannot tolerate the generic (only $21. for a 90 day supply) then I will stop using the drug. I was ""told"" that Letrozole (Femara generic) is exactly the same; but some reviews say otherwise.

I developed hyperthyroidism & a year ago ablated my thyroid so now am taking synthroid(another medication that I believe is making me gain weight).  Femara is very expensive - I have noticed aches/pains, back pain, high & low back, is the worst.  I find myself not being able to finish my dishes at the sink at one time.  I have to stop & bend/stretch out my back.. sit down & rest until the pain subsides, then go back to it.  My eyes have blurred I believe since starting this med, also.  There for awhile, it was affecting my fingers being painful - I type for a living, so that was a no go.  My Dr. took me off briefly & then put me on something else but I couldn't take that. .so back on Femara.  I have 1 yr to go - hoping I get back what I feel I have lost - including energy & some kind of sexual desire..  I have NONE and I'm exhausted very easily.  I am 54 & feel 74 or 80 ..  tired out.. no oomph.  I guess if it does the main job, it's worth the angst but I will be glad to get off the stuff & see how I feel then.  ",4
I had previously been on Tamoxifen for 5 years and no problems. My doctor switched me to Arimedex as he thought it was more effective but I had severe joint pain to the point I could hardly walk and when taken off it I had an allergic reaction. I have been on Femara for 5 years and until recently no problems. I thought my insomnia was just me and not the drug. I recently had a dizzy spell and could not walk for a day as I could not put any weight on my knees. The doctor told me to stop the drug and I already feel better. Do not know what I can do next.,4

Please check with your doctor if you are taking fermara and see what he tells you.  The info on fermara tells you it can cause cancer but not which types.  The worst experience of my lift.  Worse then being toid I had cancer.  Joint pain, hot flashes, insomnia (sometimes awake for up to 36 hours), vision trouble (some days I couldn't drive to work), shakes, axiety attachs.  Side effects do not start till I was on fermara for a while, just kept getting worse.  Some days I could not get out of bed without feeling pain.  ",1
"Side effects are numerous, horrific and unbearable.  The side effects have caused me to have numerous unneeded tests to rule out actual medical problems that actually were only severe Femara side effects.  I quit taking it after 2 years because the pain and other side effects outweighed any benefit.  Side effects linger on long after you stop taking it.  Good luck and be prepared for the worst.  Breast cancer is easier to deal with than Femara.",1

Dr put me on Gabapentin to help with skin burning from sweating so much. It has help with the buning, but not sweats. Don't sleep well, maybe 3-4 hrs. How one ""LITTLE"" pill can cause so much!! It seems like I gain weight from breathing air. I walk, ride my bike everyday. Watch my diet. Nothing works. Don't know if I can take femara for 5 yrs?? I'm so misrable.

"After unilateral mastectomy, no radiation, no chemo, I am on Femara and calcium & vitamin D. When I stand up after sitting awhile, my right hip and both feet-especially the bottoms of my feet--hurt; also don't sleep well, decreased libido, but all of this is tolerable for a 27% decreased chance of BC recurrence! I recently changed to taking Femara in the evening, that seems to be helping with the joint pain. Now that it is generic, I'm paying $20 for a 90-day supply. Ladies with negative experiences are probably more likely to comment, so I just wanted to say the really bad side effects don't happen to everybody.",5
"I was diagnosed in November 2008. Bottom line was Stage 2, mastectomy and chemo. I started on Tamoxifen in May 2009. A little over a year later my oncologist switched me to Femara. Sleep issues, hot flashes, weight gain, and joint pain, minor, at first. Have been on it almost a year and a half. The last few months have been horrible. Not able to sleep without medication, terrible joint pain first thing in the morning and after any sitting or laying down, frequent hot flashes, and weight gain in spite of increased exercise. A couple of weeks ago I heard about someone 70 years old who went off Femara and the side effects were mostly gone after a couple of weeks. I called my doctor, he allowed me to go off the meds for a month and then we're going to try one of the other aromatase inhibitors. After only one week my joint pain is easing up, hot flashes have diminished. No weight loss yet but I'm working out and trying to eat better. Still not sleeping at night without meds. But hoping that will change over time.   I'm hoping that the next drug won't be so bad.      ",2
"Was diagnoised with stage 1 Mucinious Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Aug. of 2009.  Had a lumpectomy followed by 6 1/2 weeks of radiation.  The Oncotype DX test was done and now I take Femara (or now the generic). The following Feb( 2010) I had a complete hysterectomy.  I have had problems with joint pain, sleeplessness, hot flashes, and fatigue.  It has been relieved somewhat by adding Cymbalta to my treatment along with recently a low dose blood pressure med at night to help ease the hot flashes.  I work out and eat mostly healthly except for the diet cokes (my only vice) and now I seem to be craving sweets!  I cannot lose weight and I feel I am losing more hair that normal. The other problem I have had is all of my rings have become too tight and I have had to have some stretched and some reset.  I feel very fortunate and blessed to have the medication to take and feel guilty about complaining.  I have no sex drive and my husband has been so understanding, but I hate what it is doing to my life. I used to work in the yard and my house was perfect.  Now it take forever to acomplish the things I want to do. ",3
"I had early stage 1 breast cancer with a lumpectomy and radiation.  I have taken Femara over 2 years and the negative effects started to develope in 3 months.  I have horrible joint pain along with numerous other side effects, dizziness, insomnia, genital fisures, etc.  According to the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) 94.4% of patients taking Femara suffer side effects.  I have 15 of the 20 or more negative effects listed.  My quality of life is gone.  I would rather take the very small chance of return of cancer than live without any quality.  I have endured numerous unneeded medical tests to rule out medical cause for my disabilities but every one found no possible explanation but Femara.  The PDR lists other cancers types resulting in patients taking Femara.  I have increased bone loss of over 10% in a 17 month period and now have serious osteoporosis.  Femara isn't a cure - it's a curse that's extremely expensive.",1
"Not sure if the medicine is effective. I havent had a reoccurance so I guess it is.  I have gained some weight, makes my joints hurt, my vision has diminished and after setting it takes a couple of seconds to get going.",4
"I have stage 3 Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  MRM right breast, radical left breast.   From the beginning, I have had a lot of joint pain.  I am 63 and wish I could feel as good as I used to.  I work full time and, after sitting for long periods of time, I notice how my lower back and hips hurt when I get up to walk, plus I have been falling more in the last 6 months, but not sure if this is causing that or not.  I have been taking Femara (Letrozole) for 1 year and was told I would need to take it for 5 years.  IBC is very aggressive so anything that will help me to continue with living, I'm up for.  ",3
I have just finished taking the generic version of Femara.. I would say I had mild side effects compared to those mentioned above.I took tamoxifen for 5 yrs which affected my rectum terribly. Femara 5yrs. I have been off about a mth. I have to admit of having more energy.Less hip pain. I exercise regularly.Massage.If can't sleep I take 1/4 of Valium it works well I don't feel groggy the next day. I feel positive. I was given 30% chance of survival. So hang in there. Be positive stop thinking about it & go on with life,5
"I had a lumpectomy and radiation for stage 0 cancer in June of 2010 and instructed to take femera for 5 years.  It has been so helpful to read others reviews.  I have mostly felt fatigue and an inability to sleep.  In the beginning I felt dizzy so my doctor told me to take the pill in the evening, which I do.  Some of my joint pains and ""sore feet"" I have attributed to ""old age"" (I'm in my 60s) but now I'm questioning if it is a side effect of femera.  I am not a pill taker (other than vitamins) and would love to stop taking the pill--but am too fearful of the consequences.  The doctor says 5 years so I have 4 more to go.  Thanks you good ladies for your input.",2
"I have very sore joints and muscle pain, extremely tired and nausea. Been on Femara for about 5 months. If I bump into anything or stub my toe the pain is terrible. Has anyone else taken this for ovarian cancer? I was diagnosed at Stage 3C in October 2011 but my body could not tolerate the chemotherapy (Taxol and carboplatin. Was thrown for a loop when they put me on the Femara. The tumor has shrunk and the CA125 has reduced but the side effects are very hard to take.",3
"I have stage IV breast cancer that is in ny bones. After several months of taking Femara, the CT scans have shown no progression and my tumor markers continue to come down every month. The side effects are hard to deal with. Hot flashes, hair loss, bone and joint pain but it may be from the cancer and I have lost a tremendous amount of weight rather than gain it. That could also be from other meds. Some fatigue but not bad when taking vitamins. You should make sure your calcium and vitamin D intake is good. I can deal with the side effects if it keeps me alive!  I do wish they could find a way to decrease the side effects, it would make quality of life better but it's not intolerable. For those women that wonder if they should stop , don't!  You do not want to find you have metastasis because you didn't want to deal with side effects. It's not worth the risk!  The side effects from the 5 years of tamoxifen were worse for me.  Also, there is no reason you should have to live with the pain. Talk to your Dr, they should prescribe you something for it. If they don't, find another Dr. It's bad enough going through breast cancer, you shouldn't have pain as well. Find a good support group like breastcancer.org where women of all stages support one another and they have professionals there to answer questions. It's wonderful. Good luck ladies, God bless ",4
severe depression,1
"severe depression, same as menopause symptoms, maybe even worse. Considering not taking it anymore but dread telling oncologist",1
"I just started taking Femara yesterday, so I can't really comment on the side effects, etc.  I went through 6 weeks of radiation after having a lumpectomy (Stage 1 cancer). I'm an active person, eat healthy, and work out.  I'm glad I found this on WEB MD where ACTUAL USERS of the drug can rate it.  Keeping my fingers crossed, and good luck to all the rest of you beautiful ladies. I'm hoping to continue enjoying life and having lots of energy.  I've got lots more living to do!  ",3
Cause cancer in my left breast.,1
"Diagnosed Dec 2007, .08 cm invasive, NO lymph node involvement, No Chemo or Radiation, Did have a Bi-lateral mastectomy Feb 08.    Began Femara March 2008.  Initial side effect was massive hair loss.  Oncologist said was not a side effect, yeah right, I would brush and wash my hair and handfuls would come out.  Finally he said ""it IS a chemo class drug"" and when my body adjusts to the medicine it would stop.  It has.    I do not know how effective it is, I'm cancer free to my knowledge.  My Oncologist does NOT do any blood testing or scans, says Oncology Society does not recommend... Hmmm.    I have no hot flashes, never did, I DO have joint and bone pain, some days it's unbearable but I soldier through it.  What else is there to do?    I have not experienced any of the other side effects others talk about.  I've never really attributed the joint and bone pain to the med.  Maybe I should.    There is NOW a GENERIC form of Femara.  I refilled last week and was given it.  I have not used it yet, I hope it is as effective as Femara itself.    I am curious is there anyone out there that has completed the five year course and if so, how are you doing now?  Still cancer free?    My Oncologist says he will take me off at five years and there is nothing else to follow up with it.    Don't worry about it now, but when the five year day comes, I will be concerned.    Positive attitude and a supportive husband has helped tremendously.  Never MISSES an appointment with me.  I traveled this journey never alone and I am blessed.",4
"This has been next to one of the worst drugs I have taken.I have joint pain, dry mouth diarrhea 24/7, vagina dryness all of which my doctor pushes aside. i will be trying to switch to something different as I just got out of the hospital after 6 days with pancreatitis which I blame on all of the meds I take.",1
"extreme joint pain, espcially in middle two fingers of right hand...they lock in place.  Shoulder pain, extreme fatigue, some depression, weight gain.  Very, very, stiff first thing in the morning.  Hair is thinning.  I think that I will stop this drug.",1
"I hate the side effects of this medication.  From the lack of sleeping properly, the loss of hair, the dry skin, the sagging breast, etc. - it may help reoccurences, but at what cost.  Is this the best there is?  Does anybody know the % rate for taking the drugs vs. taking nothing after lumpectomy + radiation?  Thank you for advice.",1
"i happy to be here to write about this pill ! it's the only  pill i could take  . but i do have a lot of side effect .that make me mad but i,m still alive 3 years later !",3
"I have been on Femara (letrisole)for three months now. It is the only treatment I am receiving for the estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer I was diagnosed with following gall bladder surgery.  So far it has reduced my tumor markers from 284 to 84 is just 3 months.  The side effects make me feel 10 years older. I have joint pain in my knees, ankles and wrists.  I am very stiff and achy if I sit too long (30 minutes) and I have severe fatigue.  My oncologist says it is not caused by the Femara, but after reading all the posts on side effects, I disagree.  I did not feel this way prior to taking this drug.  I would not even know I have breast cancer if it were not for the biopsy taken during my gall bladder surgery. Thank you ladies for posting your experiences it has helped my a lot.",4
"Diagnosed with early stage bc April 2010. Two lumpectomies and radiation, then began Femara eight months ago. Primary issue is breast pain which I do not see in other posts. Pain began after about six months. Med onc suggested I go off for several weeks - pain went away. With what I know of Tamoxifen, Arimadex, etc, what do I do now? Four more years+ to go with all the additional side effects? Is there any organization that truly cares what happens to women who have cancer?",2
Hot flashes eased after a few months.  Been taking it for 4 years.  I will continue to take it forever if it keeps my cancer from returning and/or spreading.,5
"I know the medication is working as I have not had anymore problems since surgery and radiation.  However I have been takin Med. for approx. 18 months.  I have had bone and joint pain as well as muscle pain, hot flashes, weight gain,and stay tired all the time.  Will be glad when don't have to take it anymore but will continue as would rather have these side effects than the cancer coming back.  ",5
"I went through a lumpectomy, than chemo and radiation for stage 2 breast cancer.  Did 4 1/2 years on Tomoxifin prior to going on Femara.  Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, achy joints, some tingling in hands, weight gain.  Not much fun.  Considering discontinuing use.",5
"After surgery, chemo, and radiation, I took Tamoxifen for one year with no side effects. Just over six months ago, my oncologist switched me to Femara. The joint pain in my hips and knees is constant and sometimes extremely severe. The fatigue is also constant. If it were not for my two year old grandson who lives with us and needs me desperately, I would NOT take this drug anymore, yet I have over four years to go. My oncologist assures me that my chances for a recurrence will increase greatly when I go off of the Femara. My pharmacist tells me that there is now a generic version of the drug which will decrease our costs and I'm hoping the side effects may decrease as well. Is this drug effective for any of us? Who knows? Ibuprophen helps the pain, but it doesn't eliminate it. I have found swimming to be the best exercise for it, although walking helps, too. However, standing for any length of time is next to impossible. Like my sister survivors, I am trying to live with my new normal.",3
Very bad side effects and I got cancer in my left breast while taking femara.  New doctor told me the cancer in my left breast was caused by femara.,1
"This drug gave me Raynaud's,Neuopathy, Arthritis, inflammed my entire body including the cognitive damage to my brain. I had nothing but misery for 3 yrs. It ruined my body. I quit takeing it and I will never take anything the FDA has to offer.",1
"I was diagnosed in 2002 w/early BC.Lumpectomy & radiation followed by 5 yrs tamoxifan & am now on femara for 3 1/2 yrs.After 2yrs thinning hair & the last 3 months right leg & hip pain,particularly after sitting or driving as well as bone loss.My oncologist brushed off my concerns.Thankfully I read these comments & know now these are common side effects.Exercise & stretching have helped me.When I really need to take the edge off I take 2 advil.I was told to take 3 cod liver oil capsules at dinner to help w/pain.My oncologist now wants me on boniva for oesteopinia, but I am doing alternate methods my nutritionist recommends.Who needs side effects from 2 drugs?I guess I'll stay on femara for another 1 1/2?Also if you check the study of femara, it was never completed? Thank you ladies for your honesty.It is comforting to know we are not alone!",5
"I have been taking Femara for two years for Endometriosis. I am only 24yrs old and have been battling Endo since I was 18yrs old. This drug has saved me life compared to all the pain and misery I was in. I take this along with Norethindrone on a daily basis. I have always had an ""over heating"" issue since I was born. Consistent hot flashes whether I'm asleep or just sitting in class. Do to my over heating I have to be careful not to over exert myself, then my blood sugar drops and I get weak. I can tolerate the hot flashes with out a problem but they are bad for those not used to them. I have gotten the dizzy spells from getting out of bed to the point where i felt like my heart was about to stop. It only happened once but definitely put me in a panic. Compared to the misery the Endometriosis has put me through, I will take these side effects any day. The Endo has taken over my whole abdominal cavity and I have a massive amount of infected tissue removed including a large part of my bladder. Being that I am only 24, I cant find a doctor that will do a Hysterectomy. All I wonder is what are these drugs going to do to me in the time it takes for a Hysterectomy. This drug has definitely given me my quality of life back to an extent.  ",5
I've been taken this drug for approx. one month with no side effects.,5
"i cried the other night i was in so much pain,until then i was just achy with a concent headache, my quality of life is practally zero and i have just lain on my bed for the past 2 days which cant be good,but my legs just wont let me do what i would like to do,i had my mastcomy last june followed by 8 blocks of chemo and 30 days of radiotherapy,yes the chemo was`nt nice but i knew it would be over in november, but femara is a curse that i would not wish on any woman and i`m supposed to take it for another four and a half years!! my sex drive is gone and even though i will be 60 next week i miss it, (sex is not just for you young people)i am having a mammagram in june and if things are good i will be talking to my doctor about quitting the femara and taking my chances as i`m not living i`m just exsisting, my thoughts are with all you brave women out there, God bless you all",4
"I have many side effects from taking this medication including Chronic Eye Inflammation, Severe Hair Loss, Diarrehea, Sleep issues (I sleep 2 to 4 hours & am wide awakfor 3 to 4 hours) so I never feel rested.  I also have depression, severe dry skin problems, severe vaginal dryness.  I have been taking this medication for 3 years & am trying to take it for the recommended 5 years. but the longer I take it, the side effects seem to become more severe.  My concern, is that I have been told that this medication ONLY reduces my chances of recurrence by 6%.  I am not sure that all of these side effects are worth going through for only a 6% reduction in my overall Breast Cancer recurrence.  I was told that this article regarding the only 6% Breast Cancer Recurrence reduction was in the Harvard Medical News Letter recently. ",3
"After surgery and treatment in 2009, my doctor put me on Femara. After two years, my arthritis has gotten increasingly painful, to the point where I can hardly use my thumb.  All my finger joints are now knobby and stiff, my spine cracks and pops when I walk, and my knees and feet hurt continuously. But my blood tests show the cancer is gone, so do I assume it's the excellent radiologist's treatment, the Femara, or the combination?  CANNOT WAIT to off of this stuff, however, I fear the damage is already done to my joints. ",4
"Diagnosed March of 05 at age 43.  Stage 3B.  I started taking Femara in November of 10.  After three months I started having aches and swelling in every joint of my body from my toes to my finger tips.  Took Prednisone for 10 days recently and all the aches and swelling went away. Now on a three week ""vacation"" from Femara.  Not sure I will start using it again.  My grandmother is 92 and she moves around better than I do.  Trying to stay limber with Zumba classes, which I love to do.",4
I have been cancer free for 2 1/2 years,5
"I rated Femara effective simply because   thus far I have had no signs of return of my breast cancer for three years now. Whether the reason for that has been because of Femara, I will never know.  Femera is, beyond any doubt, the worst medication I have EVER taken. Much worse than Chemo or  radiation.  Only recently, much to my embarassment (but great relief), have I realized all my agonizing pains (muscles, joints), my exeedingly extreme dehydration (dry mouth, chapped lips, terribly painful splits in my tongue), numb legs, and frightening, never ending exhaustion upon physical activity, have been caused by that small yellow pill, Femera. All my suffering has resulted in deep depression, having not only severely effected the quality of my life, but also that of my concerned famiy.  Now that I know why I've suffered so, deep in my heart, I want to discontinue Femera, so I can become normal again, but am afraid to because of the possible results.  Now that I'm aware of why I have suffered so, I intend to plan for what will be difficult days ahead, but will try to manage my activities and pain with my new knowledge and new attitude.  I'm grateful to finally understand why my body is in this crumpled condition, but live for the day when I will not have to take it anymore. ",5
"I have the hot flashes, aching joints, especially in my hands, and all-over tiredness.  But, all in all, I feel that using Femara is better than not having anything else at all. ",4
I have pain in my upper back since I started using this a year ago. There is some indication that Femara effects bones.  Several docs have reserved statements telling me to stop.... what's the real story?,1
"I have had ovarian cancer for 11 years.  I was originally diagnosed with stage 2-3 in 1999.  The first 7 years I had several reoccurances (actually, I don't think I was ever entirely in remission) which required four surgeries and 35 plus rounds of chemotherapy.  4 years ago, after another 8 rounds of chemo, the cancer was still there and spreading.  The doctor put me on Fermara and so far so good.  My PET scans have been clear.  I do have the bone and joint pain, but I also have arthritis and severe neuropathy (from the chemo), so it's hard to say what exactly it's caused from...it could be both, I guess.  In fact, all the problems I have today, i.e., bone/joint pain, neuropathy, sleep apenia, severe fatigue, weight gain, swollen ankles and feet, hair loss, etc, I had within 1-2 years of the cancer diagnosis, so all I can say is that the Fermara has probably intensified the pain in some cases but the orignal cancer treatment..(again the chemo) was where these symptoms originated.  I have learned to live with it as it beats the alternative.  Fermara appears to work and I will take it and these side effects for the rest of my life if necessary as long as I never have cancer or have to take chemotherapy again.  I am now 64 years old and hope to be around for a few more years.  ",5
"No problems and have been on it for five years. The past three I have taken a reclast infusion as well and my bone density has been imporving as well, post chemo. ",5
I've been on Femara for 3 months.  I have joint pain in my hands and thinning hair.  If my symptoms level off where they are now I will continue taking (5 years).  I've heard it will become generic in June!  This should reduce the ridiculously high cost,3
so far my only complaint is tendon and joint pain,5
"the manufacturer of femara has discount for this med. look it up on the web. u print it, i pay only$10. instead of $50. i do have med ins. i got heart palpitations after taking med. my blood pressure and choles is already high to start with. my oncotype dx is only 11 so maybe i will stop med. ",3
"Stage IV invasive ductal breast cancer HER2+ and Estrogen+.  Been on the drug since April of 08.  Hot flashes are the same as being in menapause (thought I was done with that), moderate bone pain, more significant if overtired.  Small price to pay if I can live longer.",5
I HAVE EXPERIENCE ARM OR SHOULDER PAIN AND LOWER CALF PAIN,3
"I took the medicine for fertility issues, the first month I took it I got pregnant. Im about 14 weeks and everything is looking healthy. I also had a friend that the the medicine for fertility, she is in her mid 40's and did get pregnant, but had a miscarriage.",5
I have been taking Femara for 3 months now and I have had none of the listed side effects at all. I am post menopausal and was having very few hot flashes before taking this medication and they have not increased at all. ,5
"Femara website has A card get the script for $10, did it for my grand mom saved her $675",3
"After ignoring the side effects for two years, a prescription mixup caused me to go w/o it for two weeks. Now I have resumed usage for five days and I can't stand the pain. I had built up a tolerance for it but I can no longer ignore it.  I will talk to oncologist about making a change and I am discontinuing it again today.",4
"I just went off femara after 5 years, I was one of the first to start it. Was consistently a bit achy but biggest effect was hair loss - a lot, it started the third year.  Everything was manageable, and I'm great at ""comb-overs"", and the main thing, I am  alive with no sign of cancer.  -- and folks, that's what it's all about.  Good Luck!",5
"after 1.5 years of use I regret not being better informed! stop its use I finally recovered from, lack libido, vaginal dryness, pain in joints, headache, blurry vision, HOT-HOT flashes! Not worth even when reviewing guarantees, statistics considering ALL its side effects! not worth it.",1

"I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Bi-lateral Breast Cancer in July 2008.  I also had multicentric disease, which required double mastectomy followed by 8 rounds of chemo.  NONE OF THAT WAS NEARLY AS PAINFUL AS THIS FEMARA, but if it keeps the cancer away I will endure it.  As others have said, I am 48 years old but if you see me get up out of a chair and start walking you would think I'm 98 instead.",5
"side affects are hard to live with. Body pain, hair/thin, slight weight gain, foot pain, more so when trying to walk after sleeping, foot/leg cramps, tired",3
"Initially had severe stomach cramps so stopped taking the drug for 6 weeks. Went back on it and got severe joint pain, mainly during the night so could not sleep. Dr prescribed anti-inflammatories and drug to stop reflux.  Joint pain diminished and I started getting hot flushes, so further diminished sleep as the flushes seem more severe at night. I have always loved hot weather, hot showers etc, not I can't stand the hot weather and have tepid showers etc. My knees ache constantly and I can't sit for long periods of time as my knees seize up.  I have put on weight and I get angry and depressed.  I have been on this drug for 2 years and hate it!",4

I have been taking Femara since September 2010 after surgery for early stage breast cancer.  It is too soon to say if it is effective but I feel fine.  I had previously taken another medication and had a never ending headache.  This is a big improvement. ,3
"I had a lumpectomy in Jan. 07 for early stage breast cancer; no lymph node involvement.  Had six rounds of chemo and 32 radiation treatments.  My hands went numb and have been in pain since my first radiation treatment.  They are very stiff and can't make a fist.  Have been to numerous specialists, no arthritis or nerve damage - they are baffled.  They have gotten worse on Femara.  Recently my hair started falling out, especially around the hairline.  I've been on Femara for about 2 years and on Tamoxifin for 1 year and had no problems.  Can't sleep, hands are almost non-functioning and now this latest devastating problem - severe hair loss.  I have always had twice the hair of most people and am beside myself.  I don't know what to do.  Should I continue Femara or end up bald and crippled?  It seems the Femara would have caused hair loss earlier than this.  I've been on it for two years and my hair was extremely thick and healthy. Have any of you experienced severe hair loss after two years of Femara?  I went to the doctor today for blood work to see if it's a thyroid problem.  Any advice or comments would be helpful.  I am very distraught.  Bless us all going through this treatment.",3
"I have taken femara for 4 months.  The only side effect is hot flashes.  My doctor prescribed Effexor, an antidepressant, which has greatly diminished hot flashes.",3

My blood pressure, cholesterol,and weight (20 pounds in 1 year)are up. My bone density is worse even with exercise, calcium and Vitamin D. I have difficulty with stairs. I can't take NSAIDS due to ulcers. The only thing that has improved my quality of life is an antidepresant, massage therapy, and accupuncture for the nerve pain.",5

"I started taking this Femara after a round of radiation and lumpectomy. After one week I felt depressed and fatigued. The doctor had me go off of it for a month and within two weeks I felt great. We eased into a half dose over one month, which created some fatigue, but it was manageable. After one month, I went on a full dose and within 10 days am back to being very depressed, negative and fatigued. At this point, I'm considering in going off it. I can't function effectively and I'm not able to actually do all the healthy activities that would benefit my health. I'm also experiencing some shortness of breath. ",2

"Been taking it for @ 7 months.  My feet feel pretty swollen every day.  Have some joint pain in hands also.  Having trouble sleeping.  I'm tired all the time.  I take it, though, because I'm afraid of having a recurrence.  Try to  keep busy and not think of the side effects. Have a positive attitude. Would rather take a pill a day than go through chemo and radiation again.",4
"I did have a lot of bone and joint pain for the first 1 1/2 years, I stuck it out.  I do still have some of the mild side effects.  I will be done with the medication in November of 2010. I have the night sweats, constipation and some other mild side effects.  I can't wait to see if these go away. I am cancer free. Hope to stay that way.",5
"I was diagnosed with early stage BC in July, 2006.  After a lumpectomy and 9 weeks of radiation treatments I started on Femara.  After 4 years I made the decision to quit taking the drug because I just didn't want to go on anymore.  The side effects are horrific!   My mind was gone; I couldn't even remember what day it was.  And I was and still am exhausted from lack of sleep. Between the night sweats and waking up every 1 to 2 hours with severe pain what sleep I get is restless at best. I immediately gained weight and my hair started to thin overnight.   BUT THE WORST BY FAR IS THE JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN.  I am now 62 and like others have said, I feel like 100.  Hot and cold flashes are with me day and night.  They make me crazy. I have no energy at all. There are days I don’t want to get out of bed.   This last year I have experienced blurry vision and dry eyes.  I have been diagnosed with savior depression. The list of side effects just go on and on.  I have been off the femara for 4 months but the side effects are still with me.  Does anyone know if the pain will ever go away?  Please help……",3
"I have taken Femara for one year. I have depression, joint pain, especially my fingers, fatigue, Found taking SAM-e REALLY helps, Omega fish oils too. Taking Femara is a JOB!! Four more years to go!  Have to MAKE myself exercise, as fulltime work is about all I have in me. Just turned 60 and want more birhtdays, so I am going to continue..its not the drug ladies, its the lack of estrogen. Oncologist said sam=e is ok, so try it..get health food store formula, not the cheapy one. I felt better after the third day.  It is a metabalite of an amimo acid that is supposed to be for joint mobility,comfort and support.  It also has an effect of creating a sense of well-being.  I did a test and stopped it for awhile and got worse.  It assists neurotransmitters, and there are some drugs listed on the box that can't be mixed with it. Also should not be taken by bipolar people. With sam-e, I CAN COPE.  Good luck to all of us survivors. Caroljean",5

"I am in my third month taking Femara, and have few side effects to report.  At this point I do not know the efficacy of the drug, as I haven't taken it long enough. I wish I hadn't read the negative reviews.  I'm determined to live my best life during this treatment. I think that if I believe I will have side effects or am frightened of having them, I will have them.  I'm just saying ""yes"" to life.",3
"So far after lumpectomy and no lymph node involvement I have taken had only radiation and been on Femara for almost two years and have had few side effects that I can't live with.  I feel great on a general basis and live a full and happy life despite vaginal dryness, brain fuzziness, slight joint pain and daily thoughts of having cancer. Opted for the genetic testing at MD Anderson and fell directly in the midline so made the choice to gamble and am so far winning.  I truly believe positive thinking and carrying on with doing those things you truly enjoy(I've not given up anything I previously enjoyed) have a great impact on survival.  God is in charge here, and with a supportive loving husband who tries his best to make me happy I'm willing to gamble on being around until it's my time. I'd rather live a fulfilling life now than grow old and depend on my son to be my caregiver as I have experienced with both my deceased parents.  Every day is a new one in which to enjoy and spend living and loving those things and people you truly enjoy--so be it if I'm not around to wither away and lose my faculties!  Life is too precious to worry about what could happen....enjoy what it is and love your family, friends, and pets(my dog is my joy)--who, by the way, definitely makes life much more fulfilling and enjoyable as well as giving me great pleasure.  My Dad always told me ""you gotta have someone to love, something to do, and something to look forward to"" to be truly happy.  He was right.  Find those things and it makes you and those around you much easier to live with. If I pass tomorrow I will have truly lived a life full of smelling the roses and having a drink or two when I wish.  And I will be ready to go with no regrets.     ",5
"I do have trouble sleeping once thru the night, but other side effects such as hot flashes, etc are nothing compared to cancer.  They got all the cancer and I am very happy I don't have to take chemo or radiation.  Also feel so much better since the cancer is gone!!!  Thank the Lord!!!!!! I have been having chills a lot lately, but I don't know that it is related to the femara.",5
"Like many others, I have had terrible arthritis from this drug -- same problem as described of hardly being able to stand after sitting for a few minutes and upon waking up. My feet are heavy and swollen when I first get up. My fingers are painful and all my joints are affected. I can hardly believe that my legs actually work enough to allow me to walk on a treadmill. I have been on Femara for about 2 months, at first one tablet every other day and now everyday. I guess it's also causing weight gain and another awful thing: age spots on my face (had a near-perfect complexion before). The night sweats and hot flashes are difficult, and I wake up about every 2 hours. Isn't there anything else to take that doesn't cause equally bad side effects? I can't imagine living this way for years.",1
"Have no major problem with Femara except the cost. I take blood pressure meds, lipitor and an inhaler so by June of this year I was in the hole, Femara costs me almost $450.00 a month and I know there are cheaper drugs that are just as effective.",4
"Diagnosed at age 73; lumpectomy, no lymph node involvement; Femara after radiation; cancer free at 4 1/2 years, only 6 months to go on this pill. Many users talk about being unable to get up after sitting for a while. Yes! Plus, I'm very sweaty, always too warm, (when I'm not freezing! The internal thermostat must be shot!) achy all over, not sleeping well, fatigued, no libido whatever and wondering which of these symptoms will ameliorate after I'm finished with the Femara.  On the plus side, I'm cancer free now, and grateful things are no worse. But, I have significant osteoporosis, my skin has aged, and I'm much more wrinkled than I was. I had spine surgery a year ago for spinal stenosis and sciatica; hard to know what the effect of the Femara is as opposed to just plain aging,  but I'm hoping I'll feel a bit more like my old self when I finish this medication.",5
"I'm just glad to be alive! Have been taking Femara for about 1 year, after 6 mos of chemo, a double mastectomy, and 5 weeks of radiation 2x a day. I think my leg aches are worse than before, but I have arthritis, which is, of course, progressive, so who knows? My hands are stiffer and ache sometimes. Sweats have been minimal. But--my PET scan was clear and I feel great generally. I work out 3x a week. Keep moving!! It helps. I get lots of sleep and take Celexa.",4
"Was on tamoxifen for two years. Have been on Femara since last November.  After reading the side effects, I called my doctor to tell them of my aches in my feet and ankles with more swelling as time goes on.  I was told to stop taking in for two weeks to see if things improve.  I have been off of it for two days and am already feeling better.",4
"Early breast cancer, with lymph nodes affected and removed. BRAC1 history. Need to do what's available. Side effects are not much worse than arthritis and menopause...at least it cuts the odds of reoccurance, so what more can I ask for...I want at least another 20-25 yrs if I can get them.",4
"diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at age of 47. lumpectomy and all lymph nodes on right side removed.  8 months of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation. 5 years on tomoxifen and now 3 years on femara.  side effects are minimal, occasional trouble sleeping and some fatigue, nothing life altering.  8 years cancer free, so I would say results are good.",4
"Foot and hand pain especially bad.  Hot flashes, anxiety, can't sleep.  Was surprised when I read the actual statistics of the study that they advise women to take it without a lot of discussion.  Actual deaths from all causes in both groups pretty much the same.  Could be that as many people are hurt by this drug as helped, though they didn't study that.  Half as many who took the drug had a recurrence as those who didn't.  If you have severe side effects, consider your quality of life.",1
Have been feeling tired. Fall asleep whenever I sit down and rest.  Have no energy. Also finding it painful to stand up and walk. Have been taking Femara since November 2009.  Had no problems with Tamoxifen.  Really beginning to wonder if it is worth it.  I have two more years left.  The cost is also OUTRAGEOUS.    ,3
"I first had breast cancer at age 37. I had a mastectomy and chemo., also took tamoxifin.  5 years later, the cancer metastasized to a lymph node in my trachea.  It was stage 3b.  I was then given 1 year of Herceptin and have been on Femara 5 years.  Just went into  remission.  Dr. says I have to stay on Femara forever, or until it stops working.  I hate the drug.  Severe hot flashes, many times per day, severe sweating, no sex drive, severe vaginal dryness, very blurry vision.  I do not have the arthritis pain that so many others have.  I am 49 and feel like 79.  My bones are getting thinner.  I have broken 2 ribs, one by leaning forward in a chair, the other by vacuuming!  Scared of the long term effects that are not yet known, as I am going on 5 plus years of taking Femara.  I am a guinea pig.  Plus tons of wt. gain.  I am currently 2 X my previous size.  Part is do to no exercise and depression.  ",5
"I am not too satisified with this ""stuff"" but I'm taking  it to spend a longer time with my loved ones. HOT FLASHES are bad but staying busy seems to help me more than any thing. One hits in the day I get up, wave my hands, jump up and down, and laugh at the thoughts my family must be hiding--""THE OLD GAL HAS FINALLY LOST IT.  Seriously, we are doing something positive for our selves not just sitting and waiting for the what comes.  I have mood swings, horrible headaches, some memory loss but things could be worse.  The main thread with any medication is the fact that each of us are reacting differently to femera.  Read all you can find but take every thing with ""a grain of salt"".  Blessings to you all.",3
"Second renewal was 7/26/10.  No side effects except possible cause of excessive fatigue. Will report later after monitoring of bones, etc. etc.. I take it most people responding are the negatives.  I hope.",4
"I previously had non-hodgkins lymphoma in 1980 with 21/2 years of chemo - 1 week on 1 week off.  In Jan 2007 on a routine mamo 2 lumps were found in my left  breast.  Since so far apart, I had a left masectomy.  4 rounds of chemo then Femara.  I really do not have joint pain (since I have had 3 sets of hip replacements) but I do have excessive perspiring.  I can't do anything without my chest and back sweating and getting me dretched. In the morning, after my shower, I turn on the fan and try to cool my  body down and get dry.  If this is a side effect - it is very annoying.  Otherwise I am fine!!!!!  Except painful sexual relations - grr",3
Within 3 months I had severe pain in my joints especially my thumbs and hips. When I stopped taking it it took several weeks before I was pain free.,1
This medicine gives me much pain in the joints and bones,2
"I have been taking Femara for 1 1/5 years with absolutely no ill side effects (other than hot flashes early in the treatment).  I have been told by both my oncologist and my radiation oncologist that there is NED (""no evidence of disease"").  ",5
"I had breast cancer in 2008, had a double masectomy,no lymph involement. The oncogist put me on Femara after 8 months I had so much body pain I decided I had no quality of life so I stopped  the oncogist could not say what to do so i decided I would take my chances. It is now 2010 and I still have the same body pain and can not get any answers...they tell me there is not an anadote for femara  has anyone else had this problem? I am still cancer free...Thanks",2
"I do have some muscle aches which I didn't have before this drug.  I am very stiff when I get up from sitting.  Also, my hair is still thin and I was told that Femara can keep the hair from growing.",4
"I had no problem,Im now at the end of the 5 years,my Dr. told me Im done,and I am worried as no other is to take its place.I has stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer",5
"I have been on Femara for 10 months. The 1st 3-4 months were fine or maybe I just didn't realize what I was feeling was related to the drug. Since then I have suffered with increasing joint pain starting with my ankle, then my knee and hip.  Worst is my hands.  I wake up in the morning and my hands feel swollen.  They're not but feel that way.  I can not make a fist or even hold my toothbrush for about 15 minutes until I am able to get the fingers going.  During the day they stiffen up if I haven't used them recently.  Another side effect that I realized this morning is diarrhea.  It has been awful for approximately 6 months.  I was actually taken to the ER in January with excruciating stomach pains and diarrhea.  I never put 2 and 2 together until this morning and neither did several doctors.  I've been under the care of a GI doctor and I'm actually scheduled for a colonoscopy next week to try to figure out what the problem is.  Today I decided to research more side effects of Femara.  Guess what I found as a side effect.......diarrhea!!!  Isn't the job of the doctors to find this???    Anyway, I have an appointment with my oncologist in August then I'm coming off this drug!  I will have been on it 1 year at that point.  I can tough it out until then and keep treating the symptoms but it won't be easy!",2
Musculoskeletal and joint pain so severe somedays it is difficult to move. Sexual libido is non-existent. Frequent headaches Quality of life is greatly effected because of severity of side effects,3
hot flashes and night sweats are a bit much,5
"I HAD BREAST CANCER IN OCT, 07 WITH MYSTECTOMY LEFT AND 1 NODE INVOLVEMENT. STAGE N1.  TWO TUMORS WAS LESS THAN 1/2 CENTIMETER EACH BUT I CHOSE MYSTECTOMY OVER LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID FUTURE RECURRENCE.  I HAD 4 ROUNDS CHEMO, FOLLOWED BY TAMOXIFEN FOR 2 1/2 YEARS.  I WAS PUT ON FEMARA IN FEB OF THIS YEAR (2010). I HAD THE ACHING BONES AND MUSCLES BUT DISCOVERED IT WAS THE VITAMIN D I HAD BEEN TAKING.  I WORK OUTDOORS AND WAS OBVIOUSLY GETTING ENOUGH VITAMIN D FROM THE SUN.  DOCTORS LIKE WOMEN OVER 50 ON D, BUT IN MY CASE, AFTER STOPPING THE VIT D, THE FEMARA HAS BEEN FINE.  THE ACHES AND PAINS HAVE GONE COMPLETELY AWAY.  I'LL BE 54 IN AUGUST AND SO FAR CANCER FREE.  THE CA27/29 FLUCTUATES FROM 32.2 TO 48.5 SO GETTING SCANS.  IT GOES BACK AND FORTH.  NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT UNTIL I HAVE TO!!",5
This is a small pill and easy to take but it's very expensive when you get to the end of your prescription benefits.  I wonder when this product will come in a generic form.,5
"Is the pill Femara 2.5 my doctor said to take it once a day. However, is this have side effects for losing your hair. I don't want to take this pill if this happens again to my hair. I rather go without another pill than lose my hair again. Let me know if this happened to anyone who took it. I need to know if this medicine it will be alright to take without any hair lose. If not this can stay in the medicine cabinet then I will not take it if it will have my hair fall out. No Thanks! ",1
"I'm 53 years old and feel like 80 on Femara.  I had previously taken Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years and was switched to Femara in Feb.  My bones, ankles, feet and fingers ache like arthritis would ache.  My friend went on it in Feb also, and she feels the same way.  Also have another friend that has been on it over 5 years and still has the aching.  I can't wait to get off it but have another 2 years to go.  When I sit for a while and get up I can barely move.  Everything tightens up.  The mornings are worse after sleeping all night.  I just hope and pray it's doing what it's suppose to do because the side effects suck...excuse the expression.  I almost had my oncologist schedule a bone scan to rule out bone mets.  Then, after speaking to others on Femara, and reading the comments on here, I see I am not alone.",3
I am 45 years old. After a lumpectomy and 31 radiation treatments I get a shot once a month to throw me into menopuase.  I have been on Femara for 8 months.  I am not happy at all. My hands have nasty arthritis. My hair is thinning. My bones ache and my right foot is numb and tingly.  I asked the Dr. to take me off for three weeks. The foot problem is better. My hair is a bit thicker and the bone pain is gone.  I think that this medicine is overkill.  My tumor was small and confined.  No lymph nodes affected.,3
"I am like a lot of these women I have read about. I started taking femara 5 months ago. For the first 2 months I felt fine, now it is almost embarrassing when I get up. I am 53 years old and when I stand after sitting I look like a 80 year old. My legs hurt all over until I get going good. My feet hurt a lot also. Is there any one out there that is through taking femara and have the pains went away? I sure hope this will stop after finishing the drug therapy. It will be worth it if it keeps me cancer free. ",3
"I took Arimadex for about two and one half years and had some leg pain.  Then it was recommended that I change to Femara.  After a few weeks I started having increased leg pain.  It got so bad that I could not stand it so I've been off of it for about two months.  I'm continuing to have the pain but hope the effects will lessen with time.  My doctors can't explain my leg pain that sometimes moves to my hip, ankle, thigh, and calf but I really feel that it may still be the side effects of the hormone blocker.  My doctor has me off of it on a three month trial.  I have no plan to ever take it again. Please think carefully before taking this drug.",1
"Hot flashes, fatigue, insomnia have been present since beginning this drug.",5
"Thank you for having these posts - very helpful!  Wasn't sure if half of my symptoms were imagined.  Took tamoxifen for 2.5 years (was premenopausal at time of diagnosis), switched to Femara 3 months ago when uterine lining was discovered to be growing (thank goodness nothing wrong!).  Great first month, then terrible joint pain, esp in legs and feet (toes already have neuopathy from chemo), BUT bad pain is generally only once a week; also swollen ankles and feet (ugh!); hard to lose weight - noticed a gain of 5 lbs; increased tinutus; harder to sleep thru night.  Work out every day, eat extremely well, drink lots of water, walk, meditate, and will get thru this!!",5
"I have taken Femara for 7 months and have experienced bad hot flashes especially in my head.  But the worst of all is my hair loss. It started out slowly and increased to where ""gobbs"" came out daily. This was very disstressing.  My doctor has prescribed a different medication for me to try.",4
"31 y/o female, been taking Femara with Norethindrone and Calcium with Vitamin D for treatment of severe endometriosis for 5.5 months of a 6 month recommended treatment. My debilitating endometrial pain has stopped and I don't even need pain meds. I was very scared of the side effects I read about with alternative treatments, but have experienced few noticeable symptoms. Some fatigue, back is more achey than usual, had some initial problems with irregular vaginal bleeding. Overall feel much better and my quality of life has greatly improved. Highly recommended for treatment of endometriosis!",5
"I have taken this drug for 3 years after being on Tamoxifen and Aromasin 2 years before that. All 3 drugs have made me miserable and I will be glad to stop taking them even though I am a 3-time cancer survivor. I ache all over, especially my joints and muscles. I have infrequent but severe headaches. Chronic fatigue so much so that I am unable to do much of anything. Overall I feel bad all the time and cannot sleep at night for more than 4 hours. I will stick it out with this drug to the end but it is miserable while I am on it. ",4
"I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer though was on the pill so no one sure if I was menopausal or not.  Went through chemo and radiation.  Now post-menopausal...obviously no longer on the pill.  Have been on Femara for 6 months and minor joint pain in one wrist which advil works fine.  Having trouble losing the weight from the steroids in chemo, but definately not gaining weight.  Go to the gym 3 x  week which gets feels great!   I really feel that the move you can possibly move; even if it's a little bit; you will feel better.   I want to do whatever I can to get better and stay healthy and if my oncologist feels this is the best form and I'm satisfied so far, then I'll continue.",5
My experience has been great with Femara. I have been taking it for 4 and half years. Haven't had any side effects from taking it. I think it is a very good medicine.,5
"I was diagnosed with lobular carcanoma, 4c tumor. Rather than mystectomy, my Dr sought to reduce the tumor first.  After 3 months on Femara, the tumor is  completely gone!I'll stay on Femara and have another MRI in 3 months. Will probably be on the drug for 5 years. But No surgery necessary.   Amazing results, Amazing drug.   Only side effects are increased hot flashes. I can live with that! ",5
"Actually I have been very fortunate to not experience any side effect's from Femera. I have been on the drug since Sept. 2008. I was diagnosed with hormone related breast cancer in Dec 2007. I had 8 chemo treatment's and a bilateral mastectomy on July 24/2008. So far, all is well and I am doing great....",5
its getting there since december of 2009 after my surgery to remove my utersis and both of my overis now have stage 4.2005 had to remove my left breast that was stage 3 lots of hot flashes,3
Femoral makes me very dizzy and drowsy.,3
"I had stage 2 breast cancer with one lymph node positive.  Was on Femara and terrible feet, legs, and back aching.  Felt like I was 90 when getting up from sitting or lying down.  Changed to Aromasin after 3 months, but had same side effects.  My hair has come back real thin and baby fine, can see scalp all through it.  Stayed on Aromasin for 3 mos. and now on Tamoxifen.  The aches are better now, but still no hair after 2 mos. on Tamoxifen.    For me, tamoxifen is the better choice as of now.  Would not want to go back on Femara or Aromasin again!  My best to all on this journey.",1
"Ten years after original diagnosis my breast cancer was found to have metastasized. After radiation and a year of taking Femara, the cancer was found to have spread widely through my spine and other bones in my back. I have recently started chemotherapy to attempt to stop the spread of the cancer.",2
I have been on femara for 3 years Iwant to know if this drug can cause heart problems I need to know thank you,5
I would like to know what is the standard length of time to take this medication? Do I have to take it for the rest of my life?,5
"I was diagnosed in 2005 with stage 3 ovarian cancer, had surgery followed by three months of aggressive chemo. The chemo left me with severe neuropathy in my feet and fingertips. The cancer returned, more surgery and this time started me on tamoxifen. When this didn't work, Femara was started and slowly the cancer started to decrease. For me, the side effects are terrible.  The joint pain keeps me awake at night, the neuropathy keeps me awake, the Femara itself keeps me awake.  In three days, I have had about six hours of sleep. There are days when I consider stopping the Femara because the pain is so great, but I realize it is what is keeping me alive.  ",5
"My wife had Stage 3 BC and a double mast.. She has been on this med. and she cant stand it. Her attitude has changed, with no patience at all. We have 2 young girls. She flashes all the time.",2
"I had breast cancer.  Had a mastectomy, 12 weeks of dense dose chemo and 32 treatements of radiation.  Then Femera.  My biggest problem is the pain in my fingers.  I thought it was arthirtis util I read these posts.  I have about 2 hot flashes a day but can deal with that, they come in the evening.  It is very, very expensive and puts me into the medicare gap by June.  I haven't gained weight but have a hard time retaining my current weight as it has a tendency to go down.  I do get lightheaded but thought that was because I needed to eat something.  I hate this drug but will continue to take it if it keeps me cancer free.  I would do anything on this earth to keep from taking chemo again.  It almost killed me.  Lost 45 pounds and was sicker than I have ever been in my life.",4
"I always had problems with my legs; mainly it has been with my left leg.  I have varicose veins and being over the age of 65 they have become a real trouble for me. In taking Femara the swelling of my feet and leg became unbearable; specially again the left foot and leg. Could not stand or walk, burning, aching and I could see the skin stretching and the deformity of my ankle and upper foot increase by the minute. After 7 months of suffering, I discontinue taking my medication and within days I was back to my troubled normal but not to the excessive distortion of my limbs. I try to go back to Tamoxifen which I still had on hand from when I was switched to Femara last May.  I was switched to it after 6 months of taking the Tamoxifen because it too was bothering my legs; BUT not to the extent of the Femara! Unfortunately my experiment failed; I had to stop taking the Tamoxifen because after 48 hours I was beginning to balloon up and hurting again. So I am now taking NOTHING. I was supposed to have vein intervention, but I am skeptical that my varicose veins are the total culprits of my problem, so I postponed doing anything with them.  All my life I have had swelling of the left leg and foot when taking ANY medication, even over the counter medications, so I am at the point in which I don’t know what to do; I refused chemotherapy so I REALY must take something!! I had posted this once before but it did not get posted, trying again.",1

"Stage 4 ovarian cancer was cause for complete hysterectomy as well as my rectum. Femera was prescribed for the remaining spots still visable in the scans and they are shrinking. It works, but the pain in all of my joints is horible. Constant pain causes depression. Now I have a prescription for Pxil. Exercise helps tremendously. Yoga twice a week and a 3 mile jog on the other days. I have had tremendous bone loss says the dentist. Will be addressing on my next trip to MDA.",5

After chemo (8 rounds) my hair came back beautifully, but now due to femara I have a receiding hair line. No desire for sex whatsover, I'd rather watch Law & Order. Sometimes feel as if I'm having a major meltdown. I've got another 2 1/2 years, don't know how I'm going to make it. I take lunesta & neurontin so I can sleep at night, & effexor for the hot flashes during the day. I feel as if I coming apart as the seams.",3
Have been taking for a little over 5years and no serious side effects. No sign of cancer for almost 7 years.,5
After 12 years my breast cancer came back & I underwent a mastectomy & chemo. I've been on  Femara 4 months & the worst has been the hot flashes. I've found that taking the medication in the early pm lessens the flashes during the day. This has really made a difference in daily functioning. I hope all you ladies find this info helpful in your daily battles...stay strong!,4
Stage 3 BC. Started FEMERA® 10 months ago. Developed blood clots in leg recently. one broke away & traveled to the lung. Was in hospital & am now on Coumidan® therapy for at least a year. Am off Femera® now.,3
I have been taking this for 6 months' I've just noticed Iam having some problems with my wrist hurting.,4
"side effects are bad, I had a headache everyday. i started taking the pill at bedtime and only half of it so i feel better.",1
I have experienced some aches in bones/muscles. Especially notice that my feet hurt when standing for awhile at work. I was wondering about that until I read some other posts. Also some lightheadedness once in a while. All symptoms are bearable.,4
Had to stop taking Arimidex because of severe bone pain.I have been taking Femara for 5 weeks. FATIGUE!!!! NAUSEA!!!!! Will it end? Is it worth it?,3
This medication has thrown me into depression,1
"I have been on Femara for over a year and the pain in the joints is over-whelming.  I feel like an 90 year old woman.  If I sit down, it takes me forever to get up.  I hate feeling this.  My doctor says that it only affects the hands and feet but my joints hurt all over.  My hair is thinning and it is hard to sleep at night.  I am always tired and my vision and memory are also affected.",3
"Just completed 3 years of femara.  Before that I was on tamoxifon.  Last week my oncologist released me.  Hallelujah! If I was experiencing side effects (other than the vag dryness, etc., I was unaware of it.  Glad I didn't discover this website while taking the femara! My imagination might have gotten the better of me.",5
It's too early to tell if treatment works.However I cannot continue on it as 30 days worth is just less than $500.00. Ridiculous my Plavix is almost $200. for a month's supply.     Think I will take my chances!!!,1
No problems at all,5
"I have no idea if this drug is effective.  I have taken it for 10 months after completing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy + herceptin for 1 year.  I have gained weight (10 lbs above pre-cancer weight), have joint pain, and I have higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels than before taking drug. Herceptin can cause joint pain and numbness side effects, so I am unsure which drug caused these conditions in me. ",3
i am taking Femara 2.5mg from 7-6-09 hormon theraphy post operative treatment.no side effect faced.,2
"I have had many of the side effects, especially nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath.",4
"Absolutely no side effects for the first 2-3 months which delighted me as I had read about horrible side effects.  Then--suddenly I was having bone pain in legs (felt like someone took a 2x4 and whacked me across the leg bones)--joint pain in shoulders, knees, ankles, feet, and fingers.  Also--hair thinning badly--and gained 15 pounds in about 2 months.  Cholesterol has remained ok--too early to tell about bone loss.  While I am 65 years old, I move like my Mom did when she was in her 80s--difficult to stand up after sitting for more than 20 minutes--and it takes forever to get everything moving once I do get up.  Insomnia is my constant companion these days--along with depression.  HOWEVER--I had my 6 month checkup and was cancer-free.  Guess it's kind of a crap shoot--don't take it and take a chance on cancer returning--or take it and put up with the side effects.  Good luck to all of us who struggle with this.",5
I have been taking Femara for about four months now.  I have not had any significant side effects.  ,4
"After lumpectomy surgery and radiation I started taking Femara (with hesitation) 8 months ago.  Only mild symptoms of pain in finger and toe joints.  Nearly unnoticeable.  Vaginal dryness, painful intercourse and frequent UTI's very noticable.  Dr wants to put me on Vagifem but then I will be taking 1 drug to counteract the effects of another drug.  I do not like that.  I also have lung changes due to radiation.  Maybe the cure is as bad as the cause?",3
"I had stage I breast cancer.  Had a lumpectomy. Completed 4 chemo sessions and 6 weeks of radiation.  Started femara after chemo.  Felt fine for a few months then developed blood clots in leg and 6 cent. clot in breast.  I now have terrible leg and feet pain, can't sleep have to take warfarin for clots.  Some vision problems.  I am starting to think this is all caused by femara.  Since dr.s feel like they removed all the cancer (none in lymph nodes).  Do I really need to take femara.  Seems like overkill.  ",1
I do have joint pain and hot flashes.  ,5
"I'm 57, feel like 97.  I've been on Femara for about 5 weeks, and the joint pain is almost unbearable, shoulders, back, hips, knees, elbows.  I feel like I've been beat with a baseball bat.  I hope it's worth it.",4
tried all the time,3
good,4
"I have been on it since June 2009 (5 months) and don't notice many side effects.  I am also on Zoladex which DOES cause many side effects, so it may be difficult to distinguish which medicine is causing what side effect.  All in all, I think Femera will work for me.",2
"Very Achy Joints and muscles. Some neasuea, no energy and severe heart burn after taking medicine. I too Hate this medicine. I was started on Tomoxifen and became allergic to it and switched to Femara.  UGH!!!",3
"The first two months on Fermara were fine, no side effects, but oh, that third month!!! severe joint pain in both thumbs which has turned into arthritis and trigger ""thumbs"" very painful,knee aches, etc. Feel like I have aged 10 years...will never never take it again!!! I stopped after the third month...five years of feeling like this, no way...will go to see my gp and see if he can save my thumbs with a steroid shot.",1
"very tired,need a lot more sleep, hands and feet hurt",3
"I have been taking Femera for almost 4 years. I have no energy, bones ache terribly and am losing my body hair. Sex is very uncomfortable and really have no want for it.",4
I have been taking femara a little over 2 years.  I just started seeing a side affect which is hair loss.  I lose hair every day.  It is starting to effect me emotionally. ,4
"Have been on this drug for 7 Months. After 3 years on Tamoxfin. I have knee pain, night sweats,high chlostorol,and blurred vision!! UGH! Going to talk to Dr. next visit and find out % of breast cancer returning without it!  HATE IT!",4
I was on tamoxifen for 5 years and then put on this med. I have no energy what so ever. Joint pain and no energy is so depressing I feel like I need to stop taking it. I had no real problems with tamoxifen but this drug has been terrible so far. Can't wait for my next Dr. appt. ,5
"MY HANDS,FEET,LEGS ALL HURT ALL THE TIME..I HAVE GAINED 9 POUNDS IN 3 MONTHES AND I WATCH WHAT I EAT.I HAVE DAY AND NIGHT SWEATS.OR HOT FLASHES ALOT..MY MOOD DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AFFECTED TO MUCH..HAVE MY MOMENTS ",1
"Refusing pills after 1st BC, The cancer  returned again  4 years later in the same area.  Stage 3a and so onto Femara.  1st year no problems so prevalent, but upon second year can hardly walk, spinal stenosis in neck and just ready to go off of it in month 24.  I have had enough.  This is not quality life, pain killers frequently and not able to stand for 5 minutes.  Get UTI's when going in a pool, so that exercise that I love, swimming is out for now.  I will write back to let you know when the pain is gone after the 24 month period.  It is now month 22.  it took me so long to realize it was this med, thought I had arthritis everywhere, and yes i feel 90 and I just turned 60.  My daughter the PA student, told me to read the reviews. I wish everyone best, as I know your suffering.",3
"I was put on this medication following diagnosis of breast cancer.  I began experiencing night sweats, severe headaches, weight gain, rash on legs, and horrible joint pain.  After surgery and completing radiation treatment, I began questioning the use of Femara.  After much discussion with all my doctors, I have refused further treatment with Femara.  I wish I had researched Femara more thoroughly before agreeing to take it.  I would have just said NO!!",1
"I am a 55 yr old woman who was diagnosed with BC in May of 2008. After surgery and radiation treatments I have been on Femara since Oct 2008. The first 3 months were fine, then everything changed. Every joint in my body started hurting when I tried to get up or sit down. I can no longer think about having a sex life due to the dryness even with the vagifem my doctor has prescribed. And now i have found that there is a new study that may cause doctors to keep patients on this drug for longer than the original 5 years, I'll find out more on my next visit. I'm afraid I wont be able to walk by then. (oh, and sleeping is a thing of the past). I'm happy the surgery had a good outcome but I wish there were better drugs. ",3
I started taking Femara after I found a considerable lump in my right breast which turned out to be breast cancer. I decided to have my right breast removed. Almost all of the female side of my family have had breast cancer. I could not have radiation or the regular chemo treatment due to having COPD from years of smoking. (I no longer smoke). My Dr. started me on this medication 6 months ago. My joints and bones are so painful some times I can't stand it. I am having hot flashes again.  I am 62 and feel like I am 92 and I have no energy at all. I just hope it gets better.,4
I was taking Femara for 15 days and developed a signs of a heart attack and had very difficult breathing. I told my doctor about and he said it wasn't the femara. I am very allergic to medicine. I went to the hospital with heart attack symtoms. So I took myself off the femara and now am doing fine.,1
"Lumpectomy, hysterectomy, chemo, radiation.  I had increased hot flashes and joint pain (all joints) especially in the morning.  They have subsided considerably.  Dry skin and hair, vaginal dryness.  Most of the symptoms associated with menopause.  My energy level has increased in the last year.  I will do what I can to beat the cancer.",5
"I have been on Femara for about 10 months -I am 68 and have arthritis so it didn't occur to me that the horrible back pains, etc were anything except arthritis until recently when I noticed my hair is thinning rapidly. I then read reviews of Femara and realized my new problems are drug related. Having also had colon cancer, I truly believe I can endure anything if it works. I can only hope Femara is effective. My sister recently passed away from breast cancer.",5
"I was diagnosed with stage III BC in 2003. After chemo, bilateral mastectomy and radiation, I have been on Femara for almost five years. Yes, I have developed osteopenia, but am trying to battle that through exercise and diet and will probably stay on Femara some more time. I have never experienced side effects. It has kept me free of cancer and just had all body scans and everything came out great, except some bone loss, which my physician says may well reverse itself after treatment.I was very surprised to see so many women had many side effects.",5
I haven`t had any unusual side effects.`,3
" I had breast cancer 17 years ago and had a bilateral mastectomy at that time. On June 8th I found out I had it again and it was hormone receptor positive, which is a good thing. This time they found it in my gallbladder and it had spread to the bones, a place in the skull and one ovary. I am very thankful that I was the one diagnosed with cancer and not my girls or husband.  I survived it once and am going to give it my best shot this time also. I was started on a daily dose of Femara June 11 and an IV injection of Zometa once a month.  I have not had any side effects except for hot flashes and some sleeplessness. When there are other aches and pains they are not severe and I hesitate to blame the medicine.  I am just glad it was found and is treatable.  I was 40 the first time and had Chemo so when I found out this time I could just take Femara and Zometa I was thrilled not to be taking Chemo. I would take Femara any day over Chemo.  I have had very good results.  My tumor markers were in the high 60s when I started, the 2nd month in the 40s and this last time they were 32.5, almost in the normal range.  I am thrilled with the results.  I will have a bone scan and CT scan in December to see how things are going. ",5

"i am only 34 years old, breast cancer came back a second time and spread to the lungs, my cancer was estrogin postive and after eight month chemo, now on this drug for the past month, the hot flashes got worse, joint pain is intense and coughing alot along with not being able to sleep is horrible. i was on tamoxifan and it was not as bad as this",4
"I had a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation for early stage breast cancer five years ago. I had previously always enjoyed excellent health.  I took Tamoxifen for about four years and have been on Femara now almost a year. Since I have been taking the Femara,  I have a lot of mild joint pain, I am very tired all the time and have extreme hot flashes.  I am so uncomfortable, it is making me depressed, I have never before had this problem, and prevously felt very youthful and positive.  I have lost that feeling; I now feel like my body is ""rusting out from the inside.""  I work out on a treadmill about five hours a week, I am still able to, but on occassion, I have to start slowly until the pain goes away.  I dislike this medication so much that I sometimes think it is better to risk getting cancer again than continue taking it.",3
"I am 50 and was diagnosed 6/08 with an early stage breast cancer.  Chose to have a double mastectomy followed by Femara.  After using femara for 6 weeks had terrible bone and joint pain and could not sleep. Continued using femara hoping the pains would go away.  The doctor checked my liver enzymes and they were elevated so I had to stop the drug.  It has been four months and I still have joint pain and my liver tests have not gone back to normal yet.  My dr. is watching me, hoping this will resolove.  Anyone else with this side effect? Contacted manufacturer, they have no data.",1
"On Femara for 8 months.  Horrible joint pain in hands (almost crippling), frequent numbness in hands and feet, difficulty standing after sitting due to joint pain in back and hips, insomnia, low libido, feel 90, I'm 58.  Had lumpectomy Jan. 2007 with chemo and radiation.  Took Tamoxifin for 1 year and now Femara for 8 months.  So far cancer free, but I hate this medication and radiation.  My hands went numb during my first radiation treatment of 32 treatments.  The doc said ""it's nothing we're doing"".  I don't believe it.  Good luck and God Bless to all the cancer thrivers out there.  I want to stop taking Femara, but am afraid cancer will return.",3
"     It's impossible to say if this drug is working, but the side effects(I hope) will be worth it when after 3 more years I will still be cancer free. One month in, it was like taking a sugar pill-the next month, my body felt like it had aged 20 years in the joints, mostly my feet. Once moving it's ok but getting started is awkward. I will prevail!! With yoga,swimming biking, hiking, running, and weight training. It is critical to be VERY WELL hydrated as this helps protect the joints and tendons! ALSO, being strictly a 2 glass of wine person, my tolerance is EXTREMELY REDUCED!!!! I get tipsy quickly and with the cranky joints it can be quite undignified! Peace to all, may you endure no suffering and always dwell in your heart. Be happy!!",3

I have been on this drug for about 10 months.  I had a lumpectomy & mammosite radiation in 2006. Dr. put me on Femara after hysterectomy last year. Pain started in my elbows & moved to my shoulders & now my lower back & hips.  I cannot stand in one place for more than 5 min. or my back locks up.  I do find that walking and regular workouts at Curves do help.  I also take Prozac which seems to help a bit with the hot flashes & night sweats.  Advil or Aleve sometimes help with the pain at night.  Now I have new insurance which is going to cause me to have to pay nearly full price for this.  Not happy about that!  Did I say Healthcare Reform NOW??,4
"Had strong joint pain in 3rd month. Doctor suggested 200 mg alpha lipoic acid and 200 mg hyaluronic acid to reduce inflammation. Now back to whatever joint pain from arthritis I had before Femara. Also do tai chi, water aerobics and strength training. Only missed one tai chi class after surgery, which helped arm immensely. Also really helped by strength training. Now do not feel affected by Femara.",5
I have been on Femara for about 9 months and have had a very painful wrist - got a steroid shot - now very stiff and painful forefinger - can hardly use. I'm going to dr. tomorrow - suspicious lump in breast that received lumpectomy and 5 day Mammosite radiation. I'm 60 yrs. old.,2
"Fortunately, I only have experienced some fatigue in the evening.  I am taking Femara for 1 1/2 years now & find it very easy to use.",5
I've been taking Femara for 4 months. My level of physcial fitness has definitely declined but not to the point where I am unable to function.  I have joint pain just about everywhere but I absolutely refused to give in to it.  I now do Yoga every day and lift weights.  I power walk 5 days/week at least 2 miles. I am 72 years old and live by the rule that 'Attitude is Survival'.    ,3
"Have been on arimidex, which gave me stomach aches, aromicen which gave me migraines. Now on femara. I  to have knee pain and very tired but I guess this is better then the last 2 ",4
Since on Femara have had Joint nodules on both pinkies.Arthritis ruled out by Rheumatologist and then knee pain and generalized joint stiffness.Oncologist reluctant to switch to tamoxifin.Have others had this experience?I feel that the quality of my life is compromised by this med and even though tamoxifin is not as effective perhaps I would do better on it given that I am a very active 82yr old and not to concerned re mortality rates,4
I too have had joint pain taking this....all in the knees.  My oncologist said this probably was not from femara as it is usually in the hands.  As I have just read from all the posts...we DO have it in the knees.  I am going to an osteosurgeon to have the knees checked out now. I too feel like I am 95 and I am only 58.  Very debilitating and frustrating.  The cancer never felt this bad.  ,3
"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. I am now 58 yrs old,but feel older since being on femara since 3/07. But if taking this med will help assure no reaccurance than i would rather deal with some of the side effects. My feet,back,legs,have been really aching and sore. I have been very tired. I also gained weight,which i tend to have that problem anyway. But I'm here to tell you that you can lose weight taking Femara. I thought i wouldn't be able to but that is not true. I have lost weight since June 09 and still losing. That was part of my depression, having the weight gain,which plays alot on my self esteem. So I will continue to take Femara,because the side effects out weigh the chances of cancer re-accuring.  ",4
"I have had night sweats, aching joints, headach and dizzy spells",4
"I have been taking Femara for over a year because I had breast cancer, a lumpectomy, 7 months of chemo and radiation. I feel worse now than I did with chemo. I ache constantly, mostly in my joints; elbows, knees, ankles, neck, etc. I get horrible hot flashes, and it doesn't help that I live in Las Vegas, where it is already HOT!  I have a hard time walking for long periods of time, I can't sleep at night because of the pain. I have to take half a vidocin each morning to get moving, and when I ask the doctor for a refill, they make me feel like I'm a drug addict. But the pain is horrific, and nothing else will help. The worst part is my lack of libido and vaginal dryness, which leads to yeast infections. Depression and just plain feeling like crap is bad too. I try to stay positive and watch a lot of funny movies, and try to keep my self in check. I thought I could control the pain myself through positive energy, herbal supplements, etc, but sometimes you just have to take a pill. Good luck to all you cancer survivors out there. I guess the long-term permanent benefits outweigh the temporary pain. I am looking forward to being DONE with the horrible drug!",5
"Have been on Femara for two years.  The pain in both legs are getting worse as time goes on.  Can hardly stand after sitting for a few minutes.  Have taken calcium, vitamin D, glucosamine chondritin, and celebrex but nothing has helped even a little.  I am trying to stay on it but don't know how long I can put up with the pain and work at a full time job.",4
I have been taking this drug for 6 months.  It is worse now than in the beginning.  I am in pain everyday.  The hot flashes I can handle.  I also feel like 100 and I am 56.  I just found out I now have osteopenia and will have a bone scan next week to see the extent of damage.,3
"I have been taking Femara for two months. I have joint pain and stiffness from my hips to my feet, especially my lower back, knees and ankles.  When I sit for along time it's difficult for me to get up and move. I'm sick to my stomach most everyday, all day. I'm very emotionaly. Hot fashes and night sweats. Vaginal dryness and painful sex. I'm 56 years ol and I know that things could be alot worst but I feel terrible. I think my 85 year old mother is in better shape than me. I'll just keep going because anything is that gives me a better chance is better than not having one.",4
"I've been on Femara for two months now.  I am experiencing pain from my feet to my hips. Really bad in my ankles,knees and lower back. I also feel sick to my stomach most everyday all day. Have hot flashes and night sweats. Vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex. Very emotional too. I'm 56 and feel like I'm 86 or older. I just hope things get better instead of worst.  I know things could be worst so I just try to deal with it as it comes.",4
"I have been taking Femara for 3 months after a partial mastectomy and chemotherapy. Since taking Femara, I have had muscle pain, stiffness, and weakness in my hands (especially in the morning) and weakness in my legs. I slowly move and stretch to eleviate this, but it is painful. I am 57 and do not have arthritis.",4
"I had 3 cycles of chemo and surgery for BC. Doc recommended Femara but I'm adverse to putting meds in my body.  Hot flashes, insomnia, blurry vision, extreme fatigue, aches and pains I've never experienced before. I WAS a young 61!  I'm discontinuing this med TODAY!  Good luck to those that can tolerate it.",1
"I was diagnosed in 1999 at age 56. Lumpectomy followed by 7 1/2 weeks of radiation and 5 years on Tamoxifen. In 2004 I began another five years of Femara and will be finished in September 2009. My only complaint about this drug is the continuing joint and muscle pain. I had no side effects for the first 3 years but sometime into year 4 I started to just feel achy all over with joint pain in hips,  knees and fingers.  I have seen my oncologist every six months since 1999 and we both agree that being cancer free is well worth these inconvenient side effects.  So, even though some days I feel crummy, I plan to tough it out,not quit and give thanks everyday for being cancer free. However, I have a good friend who was diagnosed at the same time I was..same treatments, same doctor.  She quit Femara during year 2 with the same side effects. She says that in about a month all he aches and pains were gone and she felt 100% better.  I, however, am just going for it and hope that I have the same results. ",5
"At 59, I switched drugs because of severe joint paint. I am now taking Femara. I will take my last does today. I have decided the pain, weight gain, night sweats and mood swings are not worth the risk. I want a quality of life for the next five years. ",3
"My experience thus far does not coincide with the experience of many others.  I have no joint pain.  I have minor hot flashes and night sweats but nothing to interfere with my life style.  I have had a lumpectomy, intensive radiation for five days and femara.  The biggest draw back is the cost.  I am counting on Femara to keep me disease free.  ",5
"I had a lumpectomy and was cancer free for 10 1/2 years until diagnosed in August of 2008, breast metastatic bone cancer. I have taken femara everyday since and zometa by infusion every 4 weeks to strengthen bones. I have had intermittent traveling pain from neck to hips and feet. I lost 7 pounds and use Tylenol once in a while and exercise. I have also had some intestional issues in the past which have caused me to be more careful about my diet now. My 6 month progress report was ""encouraging"", as my oncologist stated with a smile. Femara is a walk in the park compared to taking tamoxifen. I take melatonin once in a while at night to sleep. It is not habit forming and works for me. New studies show some connection between zometa and its bone building properties and positive effects in helping to fight cancer. It will be interesting to see results of further studies. I am grateful to put up with the aches in exchange for life, as well as my hair and eyebrows.",5
"After only 3 months on Femara,the 5th finger on both hands(pinkie) became deformed at joint closest to the nail.Saw a Rheumatologist and arthritis was ruled out.Caused by Femara",3
"I have been on Femara for 6 mos. I am taking it in follow up to my breast cancer. I have fibromyalgia, and the muscle pain is almost unbearable.  The side effects of the femara makes treatment of the FM impossible.  I am at my wits end, I am only 51 and feel like I am 100. Not sure of the solution.",3
"I was diagnosed with early hormone poss breast cancer in 09/02(pre-menopuase)After surgery, chemo (docetaxol) I took tamoxifen for 5 years, with (1 year on arimidex which caused terrible joint pain.)I have been taking Femara for 8 months and the joint pain is back, I can't sleep, hip and back pain are constant and sitting is uncomfortable. I feel like an 90 year old. I'm 50. But if it keeps the cancer away, I'm happy to have to cope with the pain.",4
I have not noticed any side effects while using Femara for 5 years.,5
This med makes me feel like an old lady with a very bad lower back ache.,2
"I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in spring of '06 and began taking femara in the fall of that year.  I have experienced the joint/bone/muscle pain the other posts refer to; however, my review will be mostly positive.  I deal with the joint pain by taking OsteoBiflex twice a day and exercising with walking/swimming/weights and it helps a great deal.  I also take aroniaberries which can be found at www.superberries.com and they are wonderful.  You should read the testimonials from this outstanding fruit. I am also dealing with having to pay over $300 a month for this drug having entered that ""gap"" where no assistance is available.  My checkups have been wonderful. I feel great.  Meditation helps me too.  I just keep going!",5
"I have had muscle/bone pain in knees, hands and back, but is better now that I have started exercising regularly.  My most recent encounter has been with muscle spasms in the legs at night.  Mostly in the calf & feet areas, but occasionally in the thigh area which is really painful.  I am not sure this is caused by Femara, but didn't have much trouble with this before taking it.  I could not take aromacin (allergic reaction), so Femara was the next best thing and I really want what is best for me to fight this cancer, so if it means putting up with a few aches and pains then SO BE IT!!!!  I am a Fighter and I am going to Beat this Cancer.  With GOD anything is possible!!!!!",5
"Since I have been on this medication, I have suffered from hot flashes multiple times a day.  My feet and bones hurt almost constantly. Trying to walk up or down the steps, I feel like a really old person and to get up after sitting is terrible.  My feet hurt so bad. I stand for my work, so I thought it was from the standing, but after readying some of the other post, I now feel it must be the medicine.  My oncology dr. said I was cancer free at this time and so far I feel I can endure the side effects to keep me cancer free. ",3
"I have been dizzy, a little loss of memory and terrible joint pain, in my feet, legs and my fingers.  I also have a rash on the area that I had radiation.  FYI, you can try www.needymeds.com for great support with med costs.  Great rebates or just free meds.  I have actually gotten money back for my Lupron treatments!",3
"I'm 55 and I feel like I'm 90. I've had BC with radiation treatments and started Femara in 10/08. I'm not sleeping, my left knee and my lower back ache terribly all the time. It's difficult for me to stand up once I've been sitting for any lenght of time. My migraines are daily where they used to be a couple a month. My hair has started thinning. I am trying to tough this out because I'm very happy that the BC is in remission but it's getting more difficult every day.",3
"Femara was given to me because I could not tolerate tamoxifen.  It was 10 times worse than tamoxifen in its side effects.  I hurt so badly I could barely get out of bed or walk down the halls at work.  My feet hurt horribly.  I had aches and pains, depression, weight gain, terrible mood swings.  This was supposed to be better but it was certainly worse, when the oncologist insisted that I take it, I had a 2nd opinion with another one.  After reviewing my history, he said I should have quit after the tamoxifen.  I had already decided that I wasn't taking either one of them and he agreed with me.  I did manage about 2 1/2 years of therapy although it made my hmoe and work life horrible.  I was never questioned if I had a history of depression in my family or if I had it myself.  Thank goodness I went to another oncologist.  The first one never offered me any kind of support like counseling or medication monitoring.  The second one has me see a nurse practioner who monitors my cymbalta.  I feel like I am coping, although I have had a few bad days since.  I have been threatened at work with termination, was told that ""having cancer was not as bad as getting a divorce"".  If I didn't need insurance I would have been out of there.  I feel like a leper some days.  Some people hardly speak to me after 3 years.  Guess thay think it is catching!  Hope they never find out what it is like.  Was told by Human Resources manager to stop thinking about it.  How can you not?  Some people need to get a clue.  ",1
I have been very blessed and have no known side affects.,5
"Joint pain, especially the fingers.  Had terrible hot flashes, but my GP put me on Clonidine before bed.  Dramatically reduced the flashes, which I found to be the worst side effect.  Some dizziness.  Debating whether to change meds, but something else may be worse. Has not affected my weight or cholestoral.",4
"I AM GOING ON MY FIFTH YEAR AND HAVE BEEN PUT ON FEMARA, WITH LITTLE OR NO SIDE EFFECTS.  I JUST SAW MY ONCOLOGIST AND SHE SAID THAT I SHOULD JUST KEEP TAKING IT, THAT NEW STUDIES SHOW THAT IT IS STILL EFFECTIVE AFTER FIVE YEARS.",5
Have only been on medication since March 3 09 so above questions are NA,4
"I have been on Femara for 6 years following stage 1 breast cancer. Tumor was not estrogen related so I will be on Femara permanently.  I had pre-existing osteoarthritis and this drug really exacerbated the pain.  Also bone density issues and had to go to Injected Boniva. It does seem to make sleep difficult either due to the drug or the additional joint pain it causes. It is not fun but, I guess, beats the possibility of cancer returning.  Cost is terrible and I hope a generic is in the near future.",5
"I am taking Femara for 5 months after 5 yrs of tamoxifin. I had depression at first, but don't think it was the drug because I'm fine now.  However, now I have joint pain in my knees and pain in my feet, which is very painful and makes me feel old.  I had a back condition before and it does not seem worse in pain, but seems more stiff than before. I'm sleeping well but feel bloated and do not have a great appetite as in the past, nor can I eat as much.  Will be making an appointment with my doctor after reading all comments. It does beat breast cancer, but quality of life is also important.  I'm grateful but concerned.",4
have been on femara for 5 years and have been very happly with the result. No surgery or radation or cemo.  have had times that I have been tired but a vits helped out.  Hot flash every now and then. Very happy with the results of the drug.,5
Lots of joint pain - swelling - hot flashes - rash - very tired - vaginal dryness - split finger nails - cry a lot - all around not good,2
the only side effect i have had is hot flashes but they are very short,5
I have been given femara to treat infertility. After two months on it I still was not pregnant. Back in 2006 it had a new study that femara can get you pregnant. It did not for me. If anyone else is out there and took femara and got pregnant let me know. ,1
"Coming into my 2nd year taking this very expensive drug, I now pay $347.00 a month.  I have joint pain, muscle pain, lack of libido, vaginal dryness, very tired, hands hurt and feel numb sometimes, memory a little off....I wonder what else is going wrong on the inside. Just had my 6 month breast check...good. I play tennis 3 times a week to get the endorphins to my brain. After several years of insomnia I've discovered wearing a mask to shut out all light, helps keep me a sleep. I use a vaginal moisturizer to relieve the dryness and fake it with my husband to get myself into the mood...most of the time it works. My husband has been wonderful and has stood by me....sometimes a very grumpy girl!!! He deserves whatever it takes from me to make him happy. Hot baths help the joint and limb pain. Oh, also lavender soaks help with sleep. I really can't get over how great that mask helps with sleep... my college daughter turned me on to it...I think they're very popular at the dorms!!! I would love to be brave and go off the drug...to be without pain would be wonderful...so every once in a while when I just can't take it any more....I take a pain killer...get my senses back...and move on. If taking the drug will help our sisters down the road...we need to think of them....when we  just don't feel like we can do it any longer....just think of the women before us...hell, 20 years ago..they wouldn't have been able to complain...they, would have had to say goodbye to their husbands.  Good luck to us all. ",3
"After taking Tamoxifen for 5 years, I was put on Femara.  But it was not ""necessary"" - option was left to me.  Within 6 weeks, I developed lymphedema.  Then began the sore joints.  I put up with this for 2 1/2 years.  I quit taking the Femara in Nov '08 & feel like a new person!!!  ",3
"On Femara for two years. Minor hair loss at first, no weight gain. But there's no getting around the seriousness of libido loss and vaginal dryness, a real sad deal for us and those of us who have supportive husbands/partners. Having read others' experiences with cholesterol and loss of bone density, will know to have those checked. The best to all who fight this battle, armed with a drug with such mixed benefits.",4
I am 67 yrs. old and had a mastectomy in 1994 for invasive ductal carcinoma and was on Tamoxifin for 7 yrs.  In 2003 my BC returned in my lungs with a tumor in my head with 80% loss of sight in 1 eye. I took Femara for 5 yrs until the BC recurred in 2008.  I had some night sweats and bone pain for the first 6 months only.  The tumor was gone in 11 months and the BC went into remission.  CT scan showed BC had returned in August 2008 and my Oncologist  stopped the Femara.  I am now on Arimidex and have severe joint & bone pain.  I hope it is worth it because my quality of life is really bad.,4
"Don't know how effective femara will be, as I am just finishing my first year of treatment, subsequent to lumpectomy and radiation. So far, only very minor side effects: occasional hot flashes and weight gain (@ 15 lbs.)...small price to pay if it keeps me in remission.",5
I have been on Femara for a year now.  I have hot flashes now and then. The weight gain has been terrible.  I weigh more now then I did 9 months pregnant. Joint pain is bad in my legs when I stand up to walk.  It almost feels like the bottoms of my feet hurt.  The pain goes away within a minute or so of walking. I do have pain in my right shin.  It comes and goes daily.  Sometimes it wakes me up at night it's so bad.  My real concern is I have had incredible swelling in my face especially around my mouth for no reason.  It has happened at least 6 times already.  My neurologist thought it was nerves and finally ruled that as well as a food allergy out.  I just picked up my new femara perscription and noticed that under Very serious side effects is swelling: especially of the Face/tongue/throat/neck  HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM?,4
I have been on Femara for 1 year.  So far so good.  I accept that my muscles and joints hurt and that nearly every side effect is experienced in some degree.  It so beats how I felt on chemo and look forward to enjoying everyday as quality of life is OK.,4
"Have been on Femara for 5 years No other drugs previously, just radiation following a lumpectomy.  Have joint pain but still in remission. Started hair loss when I first began Femara.  Hair became very brittle and broke off and/or fell out.  Thought I too would be bald.  Solution for me was to switch shampoos and conditioners.  Went to the very creamy (almost greasy) formulas and it solved my hair problems.  My hair is in great  shape now. Possible that the Femara was more of a drying agent for my hair.  People might want to try switching to the thick, creamy shampoos  and conditioners and see what happens. I  have a rather wide selection of products that I rotate thru.  Keeps the ""build up"" down to a roar. This worked for me and hopefully will for others",5
"Femara was prescribed by Dr. Aye for my 12 year old son because he was just below my wife's height.  Dr. Aye insisted there was clinical evidence showing it was safe for children, although I don't understand why the FDA is unaware of this (their website says dangerous to embryos and no established pediatric safety).  Since I believe my son's short stature is genetic, and neither UCSF doctors or the internet indicates it was even safe, I discontinued treatment.",1
"I am 56 years old, diagnosed DCIS in July of 2006. Started femara at diagnosis, as per my oncologist. Two lumpectomies, one awful staph infection at site, 6 wks radiation.   Hot flashes were bad, but have gotten so constant, day/night several an hour, that I'm crazed. I got a terrible rash about 3 months ago-GP unable to find cause. Waiting for derm app't.  I think femara is affecting me psychologically-depression, anxiety (at times severe) I don't want go off it on my own-tho' if this gets any worse, maybe. I am seeing my doctor, who tends to brush these things off, this month.  Good luck-be healthy! ",3
"I'am not at all happy with this drug. It has caused depression,and I have noticed a behavior change with myself which I;am not pleased with. I have since dropped the RX until I speak with mr Dr. This has occured on a weekend when I could not reach the Dr and decided to discontinue the RX until further word.Why does this RX have so many unpleasant side affects? A response would be appreciated. Thanks, Carol Walters                         [email protected]",1
I HAVE BEEN PUT ON FEMARA AFTER TAKING TAMOXIFEN FOR 10 YEARS. I HAVE LESS SEVERE ADVERSE SYMPTOMS WITH FEMARA THAN I DID WI6TH TAMOXIFEN. I WILL BE ON FEMARA UNTILL 2010.,4
"have new skin allergy to shell fish, fatigue,weight gain,what's next? all after 8 months of treatment.",4
"Stage 1 BC in 1998, lumpectomy, radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen. Thought I was done.Had pain in my left leg this year. x-ray showed it spread to my femur. Had a femoral rod inserted to prevent bone breakage. Good news, so far, no other cancer seen. More radiation, but have not had chemo yet. They are just watching closely. I got another opinion on this and both oncologists agreed. Has anyone else gone thru radiation only? Been on Femara for 6 months. This drug is tearing me in a different direction every day. I'm getting used to the muscle/joint pain but am always worried that it's not from the drug but another spot of cancer.I've learned to live with night sweats, although these are getting better. What really gets to me is the mood swings. I'm either laughing or crying, but, as long as it's doing the job, I really try not to complain. In the meantime, it's regular bone, cat and PET scans and a lot of prayer. I don't mind all the tests, it's the results I fear.",4
you may have hot flashes,5
"after 7 rounds of chemo, I was put on Femara, only to find the intense hot flashes and joint pain with bone pain too much to handle.  After calling my Drs office to discuss my options (twice) with no returned call, I elected to take myself off the Femara.  I know this is risky, but can't imagine 5 years of living like this.  ",1
"Was put on Femara after 5 yrs. of Tamoxifen and Arimidex. Most intense side effects are hot flashes/night sweats and insomnia. These are more intense with Femara. My doctor has prescribed a sleep aid which has helped tremendously! I take it every night along with a low-dose generic form of neurontin and an herbal non-drug supplement for flashes and problems with sleep. No major problems with weight-gain, slight joint/muscle pain. I try to exercise every day and do weight training which helps w/the pain. I know this drug is necessary for my cancer diagnosis but I look forward to the day I no longer need it. I've been dealing w/these side-effects for 5+ years and probably have another 5 to go on the Femara, but you do what you have to do. I just thank God that these drugs and treatments are available for us. ",4
I have been taking Femara for four years and one month.  In the last two years my bone density results are getting worse.   At the time I started Femara    I had about -2.5 in the lower spine area. I am now at -3.4 in lower spine and around -1.7 in both hips.  In a few weeks I will get my second (annual) Reclast treatment - that's on top of Fosamax and the 1200 ml of calcium daily.,3
I have taken myself off Femara after only one month.  At age 51 to feel like this just isn't worth it.  The joint/bone pain and endless hot flashes were enough. I didn't take it long enough to see if there was weight gain or hair thinning.  I'm still waiting for my hair to come in after chemo.  ,1
"side effects of confusion, anxiety, memory loss.",4
"I have Stage 4 BC, cancer was in right breast and had spread to the bone. I had double mastectomy and lymph nodes removed from right arm, & both ovaries removed. (Left mastectomy was voluntary for peace of mind). I take Zometa once a month for bone builder and after 11 mo's after diagnosis, I found a tumor on my neck and my Dr started me on Femara. I've been on it almost 9 mo's. I was already experiencing muscle & joint pain from the Zometa, and hotflashes from the loss of ovaries, but I have constant joint pain in my knee, left pelvic area and lower back. The pain travels and is never constant. Does anyone else experience this?  Also night sweats are terrible! But it beats the alternative. The tumor on the neck dissolved in about 2 mo's thanks to Femara! Just finished reconstruction, I got the new ""gummy bear"" silicone gel implants. I would recommend them highly! Also I had about 3 weeks of a lot of hair loss but it has stopped now. ",5
"Diagnosed 9/01 with stage III, this was a five year treatment after surgery and chemo and radiation.  I am still in remission after 7 years.  Slight bone pain not many other side effects.",5
I have been on Femera for 1 1/2 years so far. I am triple positive.46 year old that has had ooph to be able to take femera. Without this and Herceptin it could be worst. Have all the aches and pains hot sweats and mood swings but life is good. Thank you!,5
"I have been using Femara for nearly a year and do experience some aches and pains, but then I did before treatment also.  They do not interfere much with my lifestyle.  What I am unhappy with is excessive thinning of my hair, which was not evident before taking Femara (excluding, of course, the baldness from the chemo). If the cancer stays away, it is worth it.",4
"I've been on Femara for about 2 years.  I have very bad hot flashes/night sweats, some fatigue and joint pain (mainly the lower back area).  At first, I was on another drug (I can't remember which one) but the side effects were much worse. I just had a bone density test and while I'm still in the normal range, there is a slight problem starting.",5
"i am trusting that this drug femara is keeping me from getting cancer again.but its not easy being on femara. i have alot of joint pain,hotflashes,night sweats.mood swings,and sometimes depression.all i can say is god grant me the serenity.",4
"I have been on Femara for 4 months, I have dizzy spells, patches of rash, joint pain, mood swings, some stomach pain and my hair is getting thinner by the day. Has anyone else experienced any hair loss?",3
The side effects are farely mild and as described in the medication packet so at this point of time (3 yrs. out) very tolerable.,5
"I started taking femar, after a mascectompy and lympnode(sp) removal,  so far it has been working well, doctors two months ago, and cancer is is remission.  Also take anti-depressant with this, it tends to make me blue.",5
"I have been on femara for 3 years with 2 to go after being on tamoxifen for 5 years. I've been in remission for 9 years.I have joint pain, muscle weakness, slighlty blurred vision and mild headaches. I guess the side effects outweigh the alternative. Can't wait till I'm done. ",5
"This Drug has put me in remission for 3yrs now, I make sure I take it at the same every day, I have night sweats,pain in my knees, and ankle or foot pain, but no recur yet, which is what My Doctor and I are striving for. After 5 yrs my plan is to stop taking this drug.",5
"I have been on femara since May of this year after being on tamoxifen for 5 years.  So far I have experienced  severe hot flashes, leg and knee pain, insomnia, and lower back and hip pain. Recently I have begun to bleed vaginally. Talked to my Dr. about this and he recommends a hysterectomy. After having no periods for 8 years, I am not happy about the bleeding. Has anyone else experienced this?",4
"I can't really judge its effectivness since after two months of it I had to discontinue it. The side effects were horrible! My mind was fuzzy and I was exhausted from lack of sleep. Between the night sweats and waking up every 1-2 hours with severe hip pain what sleep I got was fitful at best. I immediately gained weight had joint and muscle pain that nothing could ease. Hot and cold flashes were plaguing me day and night as if my internal thermostat was bad. The list of side effects is quite long so I will give you the abridged version. To name a few: breast pain, headache, backache, blurry vision, shortness of breath, nausea, stomach pains, etc. The final straw was when I got up from bed, about two steps toward the bathroom, I went blind. It was like someone flipped a switch! There was no lightheadedness, just no vision! After a few seconds and lots of blinking my vision returned. My MD says that the Femara probably caused my blood pressure to fall very low while I was asleep, causing the blindness. If it dropped that low, I would think I am lucky not to have had a heart attack or stroke. I give up. I now intend to try through diet and exercise to keep the cancer at bay. Make sure you are monitored very closely when taking this medication!!! I can't stress that enough. Arimadex was just as awful for me and I had to quit that one, too. I have been on these drugs since around April of this year, but no more!!!!",1
"I took this medicine 3 different times to help with Infertility. It didn't work and caused  joint pain, nasuea, vomiting, depression, infections, etc. It was awful.",1
"I have had severe joint pain which led to a total knee replacement 2 years ago.I've been on femara for 4.5 years and had lower back pain,heavy sweating, insomnia, blurred vision, and weight gain.I am tired a lot and have mood swings. The good thing is my cancer is in remission.",4
"I have taken femara for one month for infertility. I have experienced night sweats, achy muscles, weight gain, swelling and fatigue.  I am hoping it is worth it.",3
I have had no apparent side effects and best of all as far as I know my breast and lymph node involved parts have not sent cancer on to other parts of my body-- Hurray for now ! ! ,5
"I experienced hot flashes, joint pain, insomnia, night sweats, and hot burning in my hands which caused me the most pain. The loss of libido and vaginal dryness did not help me. I also became a very angry person. I am now finished with the drug, and it was worth it!!",5
Have been on the Femara for 2 months now after being on Tamoxifen for 5 years.  Have been experiencing more hot flashes than on the tamoxifen.  Also have joint and muscle pain especially in the legs and lower back and hips.  But the Dr. says the benefits outway the side effects.  Hope he is right cause the side effects are starting to get to me!,5
"I was diagnosed at stage IV with multiple mets to my spine.  Chemo and radiation showed no effect on the tumors and my first doc told me to enjoy my last few months with my family.  Second opinion doc put me immediately on Femara.  After 12 mos. of stable tumors, hourly hot flashes and aching hands and feet seem like a small price to pay for life.  Guess it's all in your perspective.",5
does this medicine cause mind or mood effects,4
"I am so excited my Dr.said to quit taking femara for 1 month-then to try aromasin instead.Femara caused over 15 hot flashes per 24 hours-vitamins B6+E didn't help.It also gives me severe back,hip+leg pain.I am only 45 but feel 90.To help control weight gain I do Leslie Sansone exercise videos.This also gives an overall sense of well being.Exercise helps with depression and fatigue.Hopefully aromasin will agree with me better.Good luck to everyone and hang in there.",1
Recently began FEMARA following radical mastectomy (right)Stage One. Today I experienced vision distortion. Overly sensitive to sunlight; circles in center of view with extensive colors on periphery. Almost psychedelic with flashes of color and pattern. I am in 3rd week of ingesting Femara. Stage one;29 lymph nodes removed. Good path report. Good bone density. Has anyone experienced this? I feel like Gollum - sensitive to sunlight or bright light. Just happened this am. No joint pain;slight dizziness; slight tiredness but I attribute that to recovery. But really serious perspiring after small amount of outdoor phsyical activity. Have you experienced this and if so how have you coped?,2
"started 7 months ago - aches and pains all over and dry vagina - now have shoulder problems - want to try and stop taking it for a while and see if any change - if so, will need to decide quality of life against staying on it for another 4 years and suffering continual pain - wan't to play golf - which I miss so much",1
"I have been on Femara for 4 years, after BC at 36. Ovaries removed, left the rest.  I can't say I like the side effects, vaginal dryness (lots of fun), achy arms and no sleep. But, I am here to complain, so I believe it is worth it. ",5
"I have had no problem taking this drug. It would help, if it wasn't so expensive.",5
"I've never been more miserable, my doctor gives me a depo shot to control the hot flashes but I still have them, I hurt all over and my cholestrol has gone up...I feel dizzy and not myself at work, sometimes light headed...I hate this drug, wish I had an alternative..my doctor just told me I was on it indefinitely...I'm not sure I can do this indefinitely..my cancer hasn't returned but I don't know if that is due to this drug or not, I was on Tomaxifen for 5 years, now Femara for 5 years....",3
I have been very happy.,5
muscle and joint pain has increased Some dizziness as well.,4
"I had premenopausal BC. Could not tolerate the Tamoxifen which prompted ovarian removal. Could not tolerate Aromasin - terrible foot pain.  Presently on Femara  for more than a year - had to cut back to 2x/wk  and the joint pain became intolerable. Now on 1x/wk.  and still getting increasing joint pain, insomnia, headaches, memory loss,weight gain, vaginal dryness , high cholesterol and now , even my fingernails are breaking down to the quick.  Sometimes several breaks a day!   I have no idea if it's Femara related - but my nails used to be very strong.   I feel incredibly old - not what I think I should be feeling at 50.   I need help getting up  from any position where I have to bend my knees.   I'm taking yoga and  weight training at the gym to keep up my strength - but it's hugely challenging.  I'm 4 years beyond my original diagnosis  and CAN""T WAIT till I can stop taking this stuff and feel normal again. Really counting the days! ",2
"My doctor has prescribed Femara for me in an attempt to reduce the amount of peritoneal fluid produced by my body because it is not being reabsorbed or secreted. I have had 1 liter of fluid aspirated from abdomin and then another 200 ml taken out transvaginally. I am only 38, no cancer so I'm a little nervous about taking this. Has anyone heard of this drug being used in for this reason? I used Arimidex for 2 wks and couldn't stand the headaches but have only taken Femara for 2 days so no side affects yet.",3
"After 18 months on this drug,I feel like I have aged about 20 years,gained weight,very sore muscles,especially legs,bottom of feet hurt alot,walking downstairs is tough,standing up after sitting for awhile is hard,thumbs are not functioning,trigger fingers,blood pressure is very high now,no energy,pill knocks me out for about 3 or 4 hours,so I have to take at night only,depression ,fatigue, is affecting liver and kidney functions. At this point,I don't know if I want to continue taking this.I think part of the problem is that you have to take the one dosage or nothing.I think the same dosage for someone weighing 150 pounds as someone weighing 250 pounds is not right.I am very sensitive to drugs and always have to take a lesser dosage of drugs.There needs to be differant strengths of these drugs, one size does not fit all.I really feel this has alot to do with all the bad side effects women are having.If Novartis reads these opinions,I hope they take my opinion seriously and try making a lesser strength pill for women who are having severe side effects, but are afraid to stop taking this drug.I think you would find this to be true. I notice your competitors have released differant strengths and one even has a liquid form, which I would be interested in because I have a problem with my esophagus not being very wide.Supposedly, it is not a good idea to cut the pill in half,so if it is dissolved in the liver , than a less potent pill needs to be available to women.You would see more women willing to stay on this drug if the strength was decreased,and probably the most severe side effects lessened.",2
I have been on this drug for about two and a half years. the drug has worked great for me. it put me in remission.,5
"I have been on Femara now for 3 years and now 5 years out with IBC I can't complain. Yes, there are the bone aches and some days much better than others. But, I'm still here and that's what counts and I'm learning to live with it!",5
"I've never taken Tamoxifen or any cancer drug until this.  I've been on Femara for 8 weeks and have joint/muscle pain. Don't want to get out of bed sometimes. So far it isn't working to shrink the cancer under my arm.  Doctors say it needs more time. Taking calcium, Vit. D, Fish Oil supplements. Getting depressed. I need to see some good results for all the pain involved.",2
"I was prescribed Femara for infertility. After 2 years of trying and two months on Clomid my doctor prescribed one dose of Femara. That month I had two large, robust eggs from which to try to conceive.  I now have a beautiful 3 month old baby girl. I had no side effects and she is perfect and a picture of health. It's worth trying if you have poor egg quality such as i did.",5
"The only obvious effect of the drug that I have experienced is vaginal dryness and lack of libido. I have aches and pains, but cannot attribute it to the Femera. At nearly 60 I still work and exercise, that may help reduce the effect. I have taken it for almost 2 years now and experienced no dramatic effects. If it keeps me cancer free I will give it kudos for effectiveness. I initially had a lumpectomy which was followed by radiation. I have never taken tomoxifin or received radiation.  So, if I remain cancer free it can only be attributed to the Femara. I'll let you know if I make it 4 more years.",4
"my only complaint is a raised cholesterol level.  Before starting femara I had a cholesterol around 150-160.  Now it creeps up every year and is over 204.  I eat a very low fat, low cholesterol diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and very little red meat but lots of chicken and fish.  What can I do to reverse this?  I do not want to have to take cholesterol medicine.",4
"I have experienced severe bone and muscle pain to the point that I find it difficult to walk up and down stairs. Vaginal dryness and itching, some discharge, hands hurt and feel numb sometimes.  I am 57 years old and feel like a hundred.  I normally work-out, treadmill and weight training.  I do feel better when I work out and take a few NSAIDs but I don't want to take those everyday for the next 5 years.  I was on  Arimidex first and that cause bone pain too but I think Femara has been worse.  Both cause hot flashes which I can live with.  Doctor put me on Tamoxifen today to see how it works.  If things don't get better, I think I am going to go off mediation and take my chances.  My quality of life is just as important as quantity.  I feel like such an old woman.  Good luck ladies",2
I have  only been taking Femara for aboutamonth.  So fsr I havehad no problems with that I am awaren of,3
"I have arthritis, bone pain, joint pain,hot flashes, night sweats, can't sleep,blurred vision, inflamed eyes, never feel good, always tried, I worry I will end up in wheel chair, This has be be one of the worst drugs I've ever taken, to stop cancer they kill the rest of you, what kind of life do I really have? And still this cancer can come still come back, what the Hell, maybe better off taking my chances without this drug. My menory is going and what else do we have?",3
"I hate this drug, I feel worst on this then I did when I went thur Chemo",1

"Have much joint and muscle pain- take aspirins 2-3 times a day; also have hot flashes, cholesterol went up so now on Lipitor and hair has thinned a lot. Bone density shows close to osteoperosis.

"After 5 years pm Tamoxifen, I have been on Femara for 2 and a half years.  I have slight hot flashes.  I had aches and pains before so do not know if the med is causing them.  And I have been losing weight through dieting. Good experience and cancer free!",4
"Ihave only been on this 3 months and had to stop yesterday with severe hand and hip pain. Also, very week as cannot open up a bottle of mouth wash along with weight gain. A couple months ago was surgically put into menapause as I was on Tamoxifin and had to stop that after 2 and half years as the side effects became to much including degenerative changes in my eyes. I will find out next week what I will try next. Good luck and God bless everyone.",2
"I have taken this drug for 3 years. I have lost 20 pounds in the past 6 months and I am still the young 44 year old that I should be. I have hot flashes, some insomnia and get muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet, but they are not major problems. As for sleep, I just wear myself out (working or shopping) and then I can get a good nights sleep.",4

"increased hotflashes, made me extremely edgy and grumpy - so much so that it almost got me fired from my job, increased weight gain. Had to switch to another medication.",3
I have been taking Femara for almost 1-1/2 yrs....the hot flashes and night sweats have deceased significantly for me.  Joint pain is worse than in the beginning. Still get tired but it is better than the first year.  Fell older than I am...56,4
"foBecause I've suffered from Fibromyalgia for years, I thought my aches and pains were due to that until I began reading about other women who have negative experiences with this drug. I now know and realize that all the pain I'm feeling is due to Femara and realize there's a difference in the two types of pain of these two conditions. I feel 100 yrs. old!!",3
"As many have written this drug has horrible side effects.  Much like my exp w/taxol chemo.  Bone, joint, muscle pain. Weakness, headaches, low back ache, hot flashes which I already had have been worse, anxious, suicidal, wake up in the middle of the night in pain, anger, there are not enough words...other than I hope it is working and protecting me from addl breast cancer.  My cancer was rare, Ductal, invasive, tubular Br Cancer with mets to the lymph nodes.   I hear you ladies!! One drug seems to be as bad as the other, but we're still here and can only hope it works!! My dr says the effects do not get better...I'm on pain killers and anxiety meds also, which helps a lot!",2
"Tamoxifen was a breeze for 4 years. Then, at 40 I had a total hysterectomy, so now I am postmenapausal and have been on Femara for 6 months. Intense hot flashes, anxiety has increased, I have had crying episodes with joint and bone pain.  I get down on the floor to play with my 5 yr old and I can not get back up by myself. I feel like I am 70+ years old.  Everything is so sore, like I exercised for 5 hours in a row!!   My oncologist is going to switch me to Aromasin tomorrow. Hopefully, relief is on the way!",2
"Started this after 3 and a half years on tamoxifen (no picnic but tolerable), then 6 months of Arimidex with swollen, tingly and painful hands and feet, puffy face, joint aches, interrupted sleep, crazy moodiness. Switched to Femara for 2 months hoping to diminish side effects (which didn't happen) and night sweats and coordination worsened. Fell twice in two days, with bad bruising, and decided to stop the medication.  Oncologist told me to take a break and then start Aromasin after I recovered, but it has now been 5 weeks and the pain and swelling are still present. It seems the effects of the medications have been cumulative over 4 years.  Has anyone out there experienced this and recovered, or is the damage permanent?  Oncologist said he sees maybe 3 or 4 patients a year (out of hundreds treated) who have this kind of reaction to aromatase inhibitors, but judging by the ratings here it appears more common.",3
"I had pre-menopausal estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in 2006.  Had Chemo, radiation, and hysterectomy at age 40.  So I'm never sure which medication or treatment is causing which side effects.  I'm experiencing the joint problems and hot and cold flashes and insomnia.  Joint problems seem to flare up only at irregular times which I don't understand.  Feels like I hung on the monkey bars for hours and now my shoulders, mostly hands, and elbows etc. would feel after you let go from hanging your body weight for a long period of time.  I welcome emails from those with similar [email protected]  did not rate this drug correctly because how am I to know what it's done for me yet?",3
severe hotflashses/sleeplessness/aching joints/muscles/inceased weight gain/a bit of dizziness and frequent nausea and tiredness,1
"I am 1 year post diagnosis, 6 months taking Femara. I have increased sweats and significant joint pain. Also began taking anti-depressant, but doesn't help with insomnia. But, if I can stay cancer -free, its worth it",3
"Just been taking for two months, but only slight side effects that others have mentioned. Nausea, unable to sleep for long periods- no more than 4-5 hours, and diminished libido. That one hurts the most! :-)",3
concerned about rise in chlestorel,4
"Some episodes of nausea, fatigue, deep depression, crying, feelings of suicide, sometimes severe joint and bone pain, headaches.",3
"It may have been one more factor that has  killed my sex life, I have wrist tendonitis for past 4 mos, which may be linked to use of this drug.  But hey, I am NED after 10 years!  ",5
I am expirencing joint pain,5
"no reoccurance of cancer, but experiencing hair loss/ not as bad as with chemo.",4
Have experienced an increase in hot flashes.,4
"Been on this for going on 4 years, have much muscle $ joint pain in my legs, also have osteoperious, but still feel it's better than breast cancer!",5
"I am having joint pain and also causing osteoporasis,,,A bad bone loss....Just don't feel well.Also dizziness very bad",3
I have had to stop taking this medication after taking it for 3 years. Insomnia was ruining my life. It's hard to be a grumpy old woman when you're only in your 40s. I was diagnosed with a recurrence in 2004 after 5 years from my first diagnosis. Quality vs quantity...,5
I had hot flashes the 1st 2 wks.,4
"I have been using 3 yrs w/continued remission.  I have not noticed side effects unless weight gain I have had of 30 pounds is result of medication.  I do have some back pain, but that was present before taking Femara.  I also have other aches and pains, but I am 66 and I just count them as part of getting older.  Right or wrong?  Doesn't matter---what does is the remission.",5
"FEMARA works for me there are side effects but minimal since the cancer is in remission.  Side effects are bone and joint pain but controlled by naproxen, weight gain hard to manage most likely due to the hormone imbalance.",5
"Since starting on Femara 1 year ago, I seem to have begun having cylical symptoms, i.e., night sweats, excessive sweating with exersion, mood swings, sleeplessness, increased anxiety, and other PMS type things.  I had been post-menapause for 5 years before the breast cancer was diagnosed.  I am also continuing to fight the fatigue. ",3
"Excessive ""sweats"". Miserable most all the time. I hope the side effects from this drug are producing a positive end result",3
"Horrible bone, joint, and muscle aching. Already had to have a total knee replacement and now the other knee is a problem.  I never had any problem before I started chemo and this drug nor did anyone in my family.  I don' think I can stand this another 3 years or I won't have any joints left.  I also have sore shoulders and hips.  I tried Arimidex first, and it was horrible too so I doubt that aromasyn will be any different.  I had a ER neg. tumor and only a mild PR positive tumor.  Will it really do me any good in the long run?",3
"Aches, pains, minor arthritis type symptoms.",3
"I have been on Letrozole for approx 2 3/4 yrs with varying side effects (depending on lot number), but the constant side effect has been the destruction of my joints, connective tissue, and mobility!  A recent bone scan has indicated the same.  It's progressively worse ",3
Started taking Letrozole in May 2018.  I have been getting many migraine visual auras which make me feel weird and out of it--I hate it. I have  mild shoulder and hip pain that I can tolerate.  I have an irregular heartbeat which I am fairly sure the drug is making worse.  I have stopped taking it to see if my pulse slows down to a more normal rate. Has anyone else experienced an increase in heart rate?,2
"This medication created a life in 2 months on oxygen, pain to breath and corotid artery disease.  I never had high cholesterol, fact is my colesterol was excellent.  Letrozole created a plaque in a few days that clogged my artery.  Surgeon never saw anything like the goop he pulled out with no signs of this disease in the artery.  This was in 2014, I am allergic anastozol and had to research other meds. I could bearly walk and couldn't hold anything in my hands. I have recently met 6 people over the last 4 months with similar issues and results reported get ignored.  ",1
"I started taking this medicine in June.  I am currently experiencing most of the unpleasant side effects.  Worst being joint aches, fatigue, hot flashes, mood swings and hair thinning.  Thankfully, I am not gaining weight.  Without yoga and acupuncture, I do not know if I could tolerate this medicine.   Good luck to anyone out there taking it!",2
"I have been taking this for 2 years now and everything was good until lately.  I have a lot of the same things going on as the others. Mostly muscle soreness, joints, tired, trigger finger on both hands, hard to walk when I first stand up until my legs relax.  I will continue to take it because I don't want my cancer to come back. ",5
"I have been on letrolzole oral for 13 months now. At first I didn't really have any problems, but the more I take it the more problems I have. I started out with severe loss of appetite. I've lost around 40 pounds since starting it. Right after I hit the year mark, I've started having severe insomnia. My doctor has tried everything to help me sleep but nothing has worked. I don't know how much longer I can take it. My diagnoses was lobular carcinoma insitu with microinvation, which was 7mm, the size of a pencil lead. I don't know whether I should keep taking it or not. I don't think I can take much more of the insomnia.    ",2
I have just been on for a week.  I use to be on Arimdex but hot flashes became so severe I had to stop it.  I decided not to take anything for a couple of y ears and now doctor said try this one.  I did find out by my radiation doctor that if I take magnesium OTC every day that would stop hot flashes.  She was right from day one they stopped it.  I took 250 mgs a day every week for a month and they helped tremendously so then I cut it down to 3 times a week.  For those of you taking this med remember magnesium can greatly decreased hot flashes.  You do not need RX for it you can find it in vitamins isle.,1
"started day after radiation ended.  within first week all 10 joints of fingers started hurting and feeling hot.  tried playing piano to keep fingers active.  doesn't help.  After 2 months, surgeon said to stop and let oncologist put me on something else.  I've been directed to give this time to clear out and start exemestane for a 2nd chance. could do tamoxifen or take nothing at all if none of these work. my cancer was caught early with a 3d mammoth and had not spread to nodes, just invasive ductal.  I was super lucky but always get annual mammograms since I was 40. My mom had it so I have been proactive watching out for it.",3
"I have been on Letrozole for 10 months now. At first I had alot of neck pain, very painful! went to several Drs. for it,they can't do any thing but physical therapy and trigger point inj. which makes things worse,tried both. so I go back to see what side effects others are having and guess what they have knee ,wrist, neck and hip pain also. Currently it is knee pain ,limits my walking and wakes me up at about 3am, very painful. I bought a knee brace which helps if I plan on walking far. Any suggestions ? When I tell the drs. this, they look at you like your requesting Cocaine or something. I just want pain relief and to sleep good without pain !!   ",3
I have been on letrozole for almost 5 years.  The joint pain in my knees has never gone away.  Stiffness is normal; especially in my legs.  Weakness in my legs is worsening.  Fingers and feet stiff and numb too. Hot flashes when I exert myself with simple tasks.  Doctor would like me to continue beyond 5 years but doctor allowing me to take 2 to 3 months off. Hope I will feel better during the break in treatment. ,5
I have been on this med for 15 years. I had no trouble until I switched pharmacies. Now I have some hair loss and many of the symptoms associated with menopause. I am 70 so menopause should be in the rear view mirror. I suspect that there must be a different manufacturer or some difference with a new pharmacy.,5
"Taking letrozole for 6 months I had no side affects at all, then the muscle aches, and joint pains started and also put me right back into menopause, with severe hot flashes...Aches and pains stop when i sit down and take a break, hot flashes have also mellowed out a bit, I have been taking this medication now for 9 months. Almost afraid to change meds, hearing how others are affected all these things may mellow, and all pills have side affects...Gained a little weight but now that is stablizing and have lost weight..",3
"This is my third medication since finishing cancer treatments. Others delivered severe side effects.  Still suffer some hot flashes, fatigue.  But growing used to these symptoms. Body aches are constant:  muscle and joint pain, stiffness in hips and legs.  Building tolerance to pain, and keep prescriptionn pain killer on hand for occasional use.  Daily walks, stretches, tai chi help greatly. Staying active also good for blood circulation and mental well-being. Only 2 1/2 years left!",4
"I have been on Letrozole for about 8 months now. Doc says we are doing the 5 year at a time plan. When I first went on it I had insane issues. I had extreme memory issues and  brain frog, extreme low energy, I would fall over for no reason while walking. Within about 8 weeks those symptoms mellowed completely out and have gained serous joint and muscle issues. Mostly in my fingers and hips but thatâ??s ok. Some days I feel 80 not 50 but I am more then willing to put up with a few aches though if it means I get to live a full life.",5
I tried for this medication only one month but not able to follow the dates to conceive my bad luck . It induced my period on time which near happened with clomid ,4
"I have been on this drug for 15 months. I have joint pain in all my joints but much worse in my elbows, wrists and hands. I had steroid shots in 7 of my fingers to relieve the pain. I have stage 3 ovarian cancer and this drug has helped keep me in remission. I will be on the drug for another 9 months. My symptoms get worse, the longer that I am on the drug but I am thankful that the drug is working to my benefit to keep the cancer from returning. I do have a lot of fatigue and pain, almost like the symptoms of my cancer. It is hard to make a fist with my hands because they are stiff and swollen. My elbows are in constant pain and I have muscle aches from my shoulders to my wrists. I take a Tylenol arthritis medicine twice a day to help. I like the purpose of this drug but it does weigh you down mentally and physically. But I will keep taking it because I am alive!",5
I have been on this medication for several months. I have gotten sever joint pain in both of my wrist which is unbearable. It is very hard to do anything and it keep me up at night because of the pain. I take Aleve and wear a Ace wrist ban but still no relieve.  ,4

"Have been on medicine for 3 1/2 years. Have noticed increase in sweating, muscle spasms, knee and leg pain. I get very fatigued by the end of the day.",4

 I have been on Letrozole for 3 and a half months now. I have pain in my fingers in my joints. I am taking Calcium and Vit. D to help with bone density.I have noticed unusual tiredness.,4
"I do find that I am aching a lot more and do have trouble getting moving again after resting.  My work requires lots of walking, so I am sore and exhausted afterward, but am so happy that I am here and able to do these things.  I will take this medication as long as my oncologist deems necessary.",5
"I have been on letrozol for 8 months and have been miserable.  Joint and muscle pain all over my body, but mostly in the legs and hips.  Gabepentin helps.  I take 600mg at night. I have started experiencing foot and hand pain.  The foot pain is the worse as I have to walk.Does anyone have any recommendations for the foot pain.",4
"I was treated for advanced Stage 3 lobular carcinoma. I had chemo first, then mastectomy, followed by radiation. My follow-up care is to take letrozole once a day for at least five years as there is a 50% reduction in breast cancer recurrence. My oncologist said that after five years we would discuss whether to continue letrozole for an additional five years, as the benefits are not as great. I am 3 and one-half years out. I have tingling, numbness, and joint pain in my feet to the point that sometimes it is difficult to walk. But, those conditions vary day by day. Some days are really good and others not so. I suffer from headaches and mood swings, too. I still have a head full of hair, but it is half as dense as before letrozole. My oncologist urged me to exercise rigorously and eat well to reduce the symptoms. So, I do that. She said to try to stay on letrozole for another year and a half. Then, I could consider coming off the drug. While I share all of this with you, I must say that my life since breast cancer has been wonderful. My husband is very supportive and understanding and encouraging. I will keep on keeping on doing what the doctors know to be the best way to a cancer-free life. I don't mind enduring some suffering along with the blessings. My prayers are with all of you.",5
"I have been taking this medication for three years now and yes I do have muscle and joint pain and really quite tired sometimes,but on the whole it's a lot better than dealing with breast cancer again.",4
Aches and pains and lack of strength.,2
"This medication has caused neuropathy in my feet and hands, not to mention the joint pain and the tendonitis. Stiffness in my feet is horrible.  I have to stretchy feet before getting up and once I do, I just have to stand a while before trying to walk.  I have talked with my doctor and she told me to stop taking it for about two weeks.    My feet hurt so bad, I feel like I am walking on my bones.",4
"I have gained weight, sleeping problems, lack of energy",3
 Only taking Letrozole for a few weeks but changed over from Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen for five years... everything hurts except my knees.... that's true... doctor said with Letrozole I will have bone loss unless I exercise three hours a week so that's what I am doing... Am losing some hair and am flippinp out about it... don't want to go bald but don't want to have cancer either... ,5
Clomid didnt help but 1 course of this I was pregnant after 5 years of trying,5
"I have not started to take this medication yet as I am a little worried. my doctor prescribed me lertozole to help with my endometriosis. After reading a lot of comments I am not terrified to take this drug. has anyone else taken this drug for endometriosis? if so, is it helping?, are the side effects intense? thank you",1
"I've been on letrozole less than a month and so far I'm more than pleased with no side effects. I had muscle pain throughout chemo and it is  getting less and less. My oncologist  was concerned that I already had muscle pain but we agreed to try it. I've  been doing leg stretches and I'm getting fantastic results. I've hiked everyday after surgery, up and down hills and it's getting a lot easier. I'm hopeful that I've found the secret for relieving muscle pain and I know that I'm one of the lucky ones without any side effects. If you're just starting on letrozole, be positive and you'll fair this process a lot better.",5
"I used it for infertility, I had tried to concieve for 3 years. My first round with letrozole worked like a charm. 14 weeks pregnant now!!",5
"I have been on Letrozole for  almost 2 years, and yes the side effects are like the ones described below: joint/ muscle pain,  back and neck pain, weight gain and shadding more like my dog. If I seat for too long, it is hard to get back and walk again.  I have to slowly move my legs to get back in my feet. I feel like I am a 80 year old lady and I am only half.  I have to keep moving and the pain and stiffness goes away even thought only temporarily. The only thing that keeps me going is that I love sports and playing tennis or lifting weights makes me forget the pain at list for the time I am moving.  It is frustrating to find that sometimes the cure is worst than the disease, but it could have been worse.",3
"Have joint and muscle pain and find it hard to sleep even though I go to bed exhausted! Have been taking this drug for almost a year and told aches and pains are usual...no advice given to help these pains. Feel  about 85yrs ....was healthy very fit til diagnosis 18 mths ago. Mastectomy, radiotherapy and herceptin. Would love to know if anything helps aches an pains.",5
"We are trying for our second child. Our first child was conceived without any help. I was also 5 years younger. I'm 38 now and did 3 doses of Clomid which did nothing. I tried Letrozole last month yet my husband was sick the day we needed to have intercourse so that was a total loss. I am on my second try of Letrozole hoping to get pregnant soon and my husband to be in good health! I have found myself having very bad mood swings and from my previous experience with Letrozole, I had the most massive ovulation cramps along with night sweats.",4
"I have Stage 4 Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer of the Bones.  Letrazole side effects I experienced were:  severe depression, anxiety, shortness of breath, some dizziness, hair loss/thinning, hot flashes,heavy unusual sweating, inability to function normally; increased fatigue, living in a fog! Some neuropathy, but no additional pain.  After approximately 4  months, oncologist had me stop taking due to greatly diminished quality of life!!  Therefore, don't know what the effectiveness really is/was other than no additional cancer found during those months.  Took with new drug, Ibrance. ",2
"I started this medication 4 days ago after I stopped taking Tamoxifen due to the way I felt.  The side effects after only 4 days on Letrozole are hideous.  I am almost ready to go back on the Tamoxifen, at least I could function.  On Letrozole I had overall puffiness, swelling in hands and feet, increased joint pain, fatigue and now the nausea has come on with a vengeance.  ",1

Tingling and weakness in my arms. Mood changes. Fatigue which is terrible lack of energy. Depression. I have stopped this drug and he has put me on Asronasin which seems to have the exact same side effects.

I also have a lot of issues with my feet - sharp jabbing pains, numbness, etc.  Weight gain and hair loss are minimal.  I find that getting up from a sitting position I need to ""find"" my legs again before I can walk - very frustrating as I was very active.  I now have very little energy and need to force myself to do ""things"".",4
"I am writing this to advise others that letrozole can be purchased at Costco for $16.39.  Other drugtores want a whopping $350 - 700 for the same drug.  I've heard that you do not have to have a membership to use the pharmacy, but even if you did, it would be well worth it.",4
"I remain breast cancer free while on Letrozole. I understand my side effects are the same symptoms of menopause. Yes, my hair is thinning and I have weight gain. The pains in my hands were relieved with Fish Oil, which was prescribed by my Oncologist. I am grateful I can take Letrozole. Some patients are estrogen receptor negative and cannot benefit from this medication. It is part of why I am breast cancer free...for now!",5
"Two years into treatment seems to be going Well.  No recurrence of cancer.  After two years, I started to notice some hot flashes but nothing unmanageable.  Prediagnosis, I had quite a few headaches which have decreased in frequency and severity.  Joint pain decreases with exercise.  Some trouble sleeping but I attributed it to new job.  ",4
"easy to take, im taking this for infertility treatment.",5
"I recently took another round of Letrozole with an injection of Menopure and it did not work. I had no ""good"" size follicles.

Just this week I've started having the same joint pain in my left hand and fingers. I went from a ""youthful"" 52, always active to feeling like I'm 90. Somedays my back and neck are very sore.

I was initially on Anastrozole but I experienced nausea so my doctor switched me to Letrozole.  I have not experience nausea with this medication but have loss of appetite.  I have lost 6 lbs. in the one month that I have been on this medication. I don't know if I should ask my doctor to switch me back to Anastrozole because the nausea was not fun either.  ,2

Also extremely tired all the time. Unlike my sister, however, I have not had any hair loss. I now understand the Dr's are now keeping patients on Letrozole for an additional five years due to the benefits. ",4
"I was feeling suicidal so I stopped taking the meds and after a few weeks I could think clearer, was not tired all the time and I began to enjoy life. Joint and muscle pain was gone.

I have mental confusion, extreme fatigue and I am on pain killers to manage the pain.  I can't imagine being like this for another three years.  Each day I have to force myself to take the pill.

Also constant nausea, dizziness, weakness, lethargy, wanting to sleep all the time, hair thinning & weight gain. I have very poor quality of life so am seriously considering coming off the drug, despite the fact that it might be 'working' for me. That's the problem, I can't see whether it's working or not. It makes the choice very difficult.",1
"Started Letrozole 3 months ago.  The only annoying side effects are the stiff ankle and knee joints after sitting for awhile.  The hot flashes are minimal and not a huge issue.  Spoke to my oncologist about these things are he said to think of it this way,"" At least you know it's working!""  Would I rather risk not taking it"" No, not a chance.

Now my biceps and shoulders are sore too and since I'm a very active person I'm having a hard time dealing with the pain. I don't like taking ibuprofen every day but that seems to be the only way to get through the pain and stay active. Swimming laps and then the hot tub jets do help though, so I do that several times a week.",3
"  I am tired most of the time, but, get through it by pushing myself.  Body aches are more than usual and now I have to get bone therapy treatment.  My bone density is very low without it.  All in all, I have passed my last 4 mammograms.  Hopefully, this drug is the reason for it.  After chemo and radiation, I will do what it takes to prevent cancer from coming back.  Good luck to everyone else on this drug, because, to me, it is a lifesaver.  Sometimes we have to give a little to get results.",4
"I have been on Letrozole for about six weeks.  Experiencing hot flashes, energy level has plummeted.  Could be partly because of the radiation treatment I am also taking.  I have had a persistent cough which has gotten worse since using it.  Wondering if others have been affected by an annoying cough?",3

I feel angry, betrayed, unimportant. No purpose. I was a young 59 yr old, always on the go, physically fit. ",3

I don't really have any major problems with it I just hope it works in the long run.,5
I have been taking Femara for about 1 year.  I can't really blame my extreme hot flashes on the medication but what I have noticed is the muscle/tendon pain.  I have been treated for a trigger finger twice which is apparently a common complaint.  I now am seeking treatment for carpal tunnel and tendonitis in my hands.  I guess it's a small price to pay to stay cancer free.,5
Just started for the first time after having breast cancer.  I have 4 1/2 years to go.  So far feeling of sick to my stomach right off the bat but hope it works.  Good luck to everyone else using this drug. ,3
"I started .5 of Letrozole in June 2011 to help get pregnant. The doctor found nothing wrong with my husband and I after all the testing and felt this would be a good first step. I took a second round in July and found out I was pregnant. I don't know for sure if it was the drug or just good timing finally, but something worked. We had been trying for almost a year, trying very hard. I didn't have any side effects with this drug. ",5
I have just recently been switched from Femara to Letrozole (I am certain cost was a major factor in this decision).  This is just the first month I am on Letrozole so it is really too early to tell the outcome.  ,1
"I am just finishing my treatment-first two years on tamoxifen but switched to letrozole after experiencing muscle spasms + cramps. 3 years on letrozole and at first experienced very bad joint pain which lasted about 1 year but did wear off, and not noticable at all now. All the way through the treatment  quite bad hot flashes (different levels from plain hot sweats to hot sweats with panic attacks). Glad to say only 1 month left now, and I will be medication free ( fingers crossed that all will be ok afterwards-that does concern me a bit). Good luck to everyone going thru' this.",5
I began taking femara after 5 years on Tamoxifen. I have taken it each day for the past two years and it has not caused any side effects that I am aware of.,5
"I was prescribed letrozole 2.5 mg for 5 days to induce ovulation. My first month I produced 2 good looking follicles, but did not get pregnant. The second month I took the same dose of medication and produced 1 good follicle. I am happy to report that I am pregnant! I have PCOS and am very pleased with the outcome.",5
"i have had some bone and joint pain while taking this medication. i have noticed the reduction in size of my tumors. the medicaton seems to be having few side effects, although i have experienced slightly more hot flashes and mood changes. i have not noticed any additional hair loss than normal.  ",4
"I have learned to live with the side effects that come from taking this medication( slight hair loss, joint pain, hot flashes, sleepy through the day, some times can't sleep, occasional dizziness...) these side effect are better than having the high chance of cancer coming back) but can not stand having shoes on for any lenght of time",5
Used for male gynomastia with good results.,5
I am 26 years old and I am on round 2 of Femara for infertility.  2.5 finally stimulated my ovaries unlike Clomid that did absolutely nothing.  Now I am starting 7.5.  I have high hopes for this dose due to the results of the lower dose.,3
I have no children yet and I have done so far 6 rounds of femara to conceive.  It worked the first time but I miscarried again and since then it hasn't worked.  It does increase mentraul cramps and bleeding.  Hopefully along with 3 other meds combined with it we will soon be pregnant again!,3
"I am also 27 years old, and am taking it to concieve my second child.  I am only on my first month of this med and I am terribly irretiable.  But I hope it works!",2
I am 27 and use this medication to concieve. I haven't really had any pain as a matter of fact it eased my endometriosis pain. I am trying for a second baby now- with this drug it is odd to see that it is used for breast cancer as well as other cancers and menopause. ,5
"My mother has been suffering terribly since month 2 of taking Femara.  After 1.5 months of treatment I convinced her to stop taking to see if the sever joint pasin in her knees went away.  After 6 weeks of being off, not a single ach in sight.  Here's a lady that could barely get out of bed in the morning.  Well, the MD have scared her so much into taking this painful drug that she will begin using again Monday.  In her case, I don't see the cons outweighing the pros.  Its a Quality of Life issue. ",3
"I have found this medication to cause joint/bone/muscle and every other kind of pain, however the pain I suffer genneraly moves to a different part of my body after a few days or weeks. I have decided the pain will subside the cancer will not! So I pray alot and am anointed at church for healing as well!",5

"I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and CLL Leukemia in June 2009. By August, I was critically anemic and losing weight uncontrollably. The Dr. placed me on IV chemo, including Rituxan, Cytoxan, and Fludarabine at 4-5 week intervals. The treatment literally saved my life and has given me a future. It's tough for three days after the drugs are administered, I can't eat or drink much during that time and keep it down, but thereafter OK again. This medication helped me, my blood numbers are going in the right direction, body weight is easier to maintain, and energy levels greatly improved! It's worked for me.",5

"To gladly use an otherwise overused cliche, this topical creme is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Which is better: to suffer a bit of embarrassment at a reddened area whilst applying the topical treatment, or having one's skin carved upon with permanent scarring? This works on both precancerous sun lesions and basal cell carcinomas. It has worked for me INSIDE the hairline, even on the scalp on the top of my head with no recurrence and no loss of hair. (It only affects fast-dividing cells, presumably the diseased ones.) If you have not heard of this—which has been around more than 20 years—indeed it makes you wonder why!",5
"After a few days the area treated became red and burned. this lasted throughout the treatment. Eventually I had to discontinue the drug due to side effects, but I believe it worked by that time. I have used other similar creams with drastic side effects. This one was so much better, and certainly better than more surgery and scars.",4
Your pay no more than 10.00 discount card is useless! I was rejected for use of the card due to having Medicare part d coverage along with supplemental coverage which was also rejected for use. I guess being over 65 and on Medicare affords us the funds to pay $415.00 for tube.,1

"A miracle drug!! Dr. Canada and this drug saved my nose and maybe my life. I had a dry red spot on my nose. Each time I removed the dry skin flake that seemed to continuously come back, the spot enlarged. Over a years time the spot grew to 2cm diameter.  One hack M.D. carved it off my nose but it came back.  Dr. Canada (now retired), directed me to me to use this cream for 10 days by rubbing it into the skin out past the afected area two to three times a day before returning to see him.  He warned me that the affected ""pre-cancerous"" area would become like a blood scab and not to pick at it.  Only the ""pre-cancerous"" tissue would be healed and the skin that was not ""pre-cancerous"" would just be softened.  He also warned me that once I started the treatment, I MUST not stop until seeing him after 10 days. During the treatment period only the affected area became a dark red.  As directed, I treated the entire nose.  The large scab on my nose was embarrassing.  On the 8th day while rubbing on the cream, the scab just came off in one big piece.  Under the scab was this smooth pink skin.  When I went to see him, he was amazed that the spot was so much larger than he thought.  I saw that he was very happy with this outcome as was I.  I had another spot on my upper chest/neck that I treated on my own with the same results.  I have never suffered a reoccurence until reciently (20 years later) I noticed some sun damaged spots on my forearms.  I will ask my physician for a prescription.   Dr. Canada practiced in Flint, Michigan.",5

"DO NOT TAKE THIS VACCINE.  I regret my choice to take this.  It is recommended for teens and adults (up to 25) who are not sexually active to prevent cervical cancer from my understanding.  I did not fully understand how one could get cervical cancer, if I did I would not have gotten this thing because I only anticipate having sex with one person for the rest of my life. Aside from that, I was totally fine after the first two shots.  No side effects whatsoever.  It was the third shot that caused all hell to break loose.  It started the next few days after the shot. I felt tingling in my hands and arms.  Then, soon after sharp pains all over my body especially in my legs.  I could not walk without severe pain.  It felt like sharp needles pricking my legs every step I took.  I was soon after diagnosed with neuropathy (nerve damage).  I am thankful that my primary physician reported this incident.  She said she hasn't seen this side effect from the vaccine reported, but a few google clicks show many people with very similar results.  It's unfortunate that either doctors are not reporting this or the vaccine company is trying to cover these ill effects up.  DO NOT TAKE THIS VACCINE.  It has been several months and the nerve pain has calmed down.  It is nearly gone and my doctor assured me that it would be temporary, but she agrees that it was due to the vaccine because she is very familiar with my medical history and saw how my health immediately declined after the third and final shot. To give some folks hope, I am almost all better.  I may have nerve pain in the legs here and there.. but hoping for a full recovery in the next few months up to a year.  To those who have already had the shots, be watchful of weird symptoms.  If you haven't gotten all 3 yet, discontinue.  I was fine up until the last shot.  Be careful, some have had worse results. Understand whether or not this shot is really necessary for you.  It wasn't for me, I suffered nerve damage for no reason.",1
"Where do I even begin? Exactly four years ago I allowed the nurse at my doctors office to give me this shot.  Big mistake! A couple of weeks later I experienced fatigue, dizziness, tingling in legs and arms, pain all over my body, and terrible anxiety and low blood sugar attacks.  I saw many doctors and specialists. The only thing wrong with me was low vitamin d count, which is now better because I take a supplement. Four years later I feel much better with less neurological symptoms but it seems like three or four times a year I'm diagnosed with some bizarre infection such as swollen lymph nodes, tonsillitis, infected cysts and for the past two years I've have recurrent bacterial vaginosis!  This has been an absolute nightmare and I am really trying to take care of myself. I recently cut out all refined sugars and starches, started taking a probiotic for the vaginal infections and a supplement containing a multitude of vitamins. Please do not get this shot! I am 25 years old and constantly worried about my health wondering what will go wrong next. Prior to this I was a healthy young adult rarely getting anything more than a cold.  I believe with all of my heart that this shot somehow messed up my immune system. ",1
"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN TAKE THESE SHOTS. unfortunately I had all 3 shots around 7 years ago and I have never been the same. I have suffered from neuropathic pain syndrome since I received this shot and my life has been hell. I was always an active person, playing many sports and working hard. So I am now a 28 year old who can no longer work, haven't been able to finish college and live in pain everyday. Unfortunately I'm going to be like this for the rest of my life, but I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else. I know of girls who have become completely paralyzed from this shot. Please please please do your research on this shot, because the bad outweighs the good heavily. It literally has ruined my life and taken away my ability to control what I want to do during my life.",1
"The Gynecologist recommended this vaccine for my 17 year old.  DO NOT VACCINATE YOUR DAUGHTERS WITH THIS VACCINE.  My daughter's side effects were fever, headache, panting, couldn't move, joint pain.  DO NOT listen to the doctor.  RUN AWAY FROM Gardasil, it is dangerous.  ",1
I received the first of the of the shots 8 years ago & had an anaphylactic reaction.  Needless to say I did not continue with the followup doses.  I will also not allow either of my daughters to get this drug.  The benefits do not outweigh the risks.,1

"http://www.medications.com/gardasil/46906 (Must read) My daughter has just had her second shot and after reading all these reviews I realize that she has had a lot of the same sx that are listed, being so extremely tired all the time since the first shot in the series, headaches and generally just not herself. She had the first shot about two years ago but we missed the others so we started them again at the doctors advice. I don't think we will be doing the next shot.  She had terrible cramping during her periods and depression that was too horrible to be normal hormone effects. The benefits do not outweigh the risks until they can get the shots more pure or whatever it is that is needed. I think the  girl in the attached review has hit the nail on the head, it makes a lot of sense. Our girls are being metal poisoned.",1
"I see a lot of negative reviews, and my heart goes out to all of you. But I did not experience any adverse affects. The shot was painful and the injection site hurt for about a day or so but I have no had any other issues. I saw someone talk about infertility but I had a son two years after I had the shot and there were no complications. I'm not sure whether my experience is typical or not, but I thought I should share it anyway.",4
"My daughter had two Gardisial doses, each time she had huge bouts or canker sores immediately following the injections and has regular outbreaks since then. we did not take the third dose. ",1
"My daughter is 16 and got the first shot two months ago. She is now experiencing occasional heavy periods, stomach/back pain when she is not on her period and occasional weakness that she did not have before. I say occasional because these are not constant symptoms that she has everyday, just every once in awhile. I am positive that it is from this shot and I feel just awful that I allowed myself to be suckered in to this ""prevention"" scheme. I will not suggest this shot to anyone and my daughther will not be getting the next two doses!",1
"My daughter, Victoria, has been ill since February 2008.  Immediately after her second vaccination, Victoria experienced severe diarrhea, vomiting  and was nauseous for about eight weeks. She had blood work done many times and  several later, she had her first seizure.  My daughter has undergone  CT scans, MRI's, MRA's, EEG's, ultrasounds, blood work on many occasions  and was hospitalized at an epilepsy center in the video EEG monitoring unit for several weeks in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  A  spinal tap was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Thereafter, Victoria   underwent a lumbar puncture with  fluoroscopy.    My daughter has been diagnosed with toxic encephalopathy secondary to the Gardasil vaccine.  She  experiences the following symptoms: non-epileptic seizures, migraines, fainting, various tremors,  twitches and numbness, intermittent leg paralysis and facial paralysis, tingling, staring or blank episodes, eye pain, joint pain, neck pain, back pain, memory loss, confusion, brain fog, regression, mood swings, hair loss  and chronic fatigue. She continues to have bouts of nausea and diarrhea. For a period of over four years, my daughter could never be left home alone, she couldn’t go to school, go out with her friends or work.   My daughter is one of  many thousands of other young girls (and boys) who experience severe adverse effects from Gardasil.",1
"My daughter passed away two weeks after having the gardasil and meningitis  shots.  We are waiting for the toxicology report from the medical examiners office to see what the cause of death was.  She was very healthy prior to the shots, had just had excellent bloodwork return from the lab.  She had a job and had just started driver's ed.  NOTHING wrong with her, the only confounding factor was the gardasil and meningitis shots.  Did she react to having both of the shots, or was it just a reaction  to one of them?  WE DON'T KNOW.  Her symptoms prior to death were headache on front of head, her legs hurt, very sleepy, loss of appetite, and she vomited once.  If anyone else out there had a similar event happen, you can contact me at [email protected]  Thank you",1
I received one dose of Gardasil when I was 17. Several days later my mouth broke out in many painful sores-white blistering sores. My doctor recommended that I not take any more of the vaccine.,1
"I feel like I'm the only person with this much of a positive experience! Around age 25 I decided to get this shot as I was still single and very cautious about STDs. I recall it hurting and I may or may not have had headaches, body aches, whatever. I always get sick for a few days after a flu vaccine, but I don't recall whether or not that happened with this one. It wouldn't have stuck out in my mind if that did happen. I wouldn't really care either way.  Then I met my ex. The jerk head didn't tell me he had a genital wart causing form of HPV until after we had slept together ... unprotected. I'd trusted him and would have never taken that risk if he had told me! I got tested about three times in the 2.5 years we were together and once after we broke up. Guess who DIDN'T get HPV!!! THAT is how the drug works people and also why we use it!   (and yes I'm absolutely positive he still had it in his system ... he had several break outs when we were together)",5

One shot nearly killed my daughter. It has left her life scared with debilitating issues. Full Aluminum toxicity with dozens of side effect. NEVER get this vaccine. ,1
"My grandaughter received 2 vaccines the last one being early December.  Since then she has had no period. This is the 4th month, and she was very regular before that.  All the doctors say this vaccine has nothing to do with missing periods, but it is too much of a coincidence for so many girls to have the same problem.  FDA needs to list this as a side effect of this medication, to put parents minds at ease.  We will not get the third shot.  Very dissatisfied with this experience.  Our daughters health is way more important that fulfilling the Governments quota of giving this drug to youngg girls.",1
"I do NOT reccomend this vaccine. This vaccine was very painful, the most painful that I've ever received, worse than the penicillin vaccine I received in my buttocks in the military.    Many of my symptoms appeared a month or more after the vaccine is given. Approximately 30 days after I received my first dosage of Gardasil, I developed a quarter-sized lump at the injection site, which was very painful. I began having severe joint, muscle and leg pain. So extreme that I awoke crying in my sleep several times within the first 40 days.   The pain has somewhat, but not completely subsided 6-months post-vaccine. I refuse to get the other dosages. My doctor was of no help and disregarded my symptoms as ""normal.""  Also, was not made aware that breastfeeding after this vaccination is very dangerous. My child missed out on this nutrients because I was more afraid of the reactions in breastfeeding babies due to Gardasil that I read about. ",1
"this ruined my life, i have had so many health problems since i got the shot when i didnt have anything wrong prior. i am in pain EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE due to the shot. i have horrible joint problems i just dont feel like myself anymore, it sucks to be young but feel so old and it is very hard to deal with because people cant relate or understand what your going through. all the doctors would deny it was the shot besides a couple doctors. no one knows how to help the people that are going through what the shot could do to you. if someone needs support or wants someone to talk to feel free to e mail me, it would be nice to have support by someone who is dealing with the issues themselves and i would like to hear of your stories as well. recklaw92 @yahoo.com ",1
"I'm a trans male who received the vaccine series b/c I still have my cervix, and want to prevent warts. I had a helluva time getting the Patient Assistance Program to cover the doses possibly b/c I turned 27 during the series.  My only side effect was muscle pain and resulting weakness in that arm following the third dose. This has lasted a troubling amount of time - approaching 3 months now. It's abating, but veeerrry slowly. I'm a pro-vaccine, public health fanatic. Get the doses - the risks of vaccination are so rare and largely unknown. The risks of the diseases - exponentially greater, and very well understood. This is a no-brainer.",3
"My 17 year old daughter started the series this fall. With the first shot, no real issues other than soreness at the injection set.  She went in right on time for her second shot.  Since then, she has been having headaches every day.  She has tried taking over the counter meds. for the headaches, but nothing is working.  Sure hope that is not a long term effect, and will eventually go away.  I did not read all the reviews before we started the shots, now I wish I had.  I am most definitely not having her get the third shot.  With the pap smear and other tests, most cervical cancers are caught so early that the shot really isn't necessary.",1

"12 year old healthy child, 2 weeks after first shot abdominal pain over next several days became most worst and low grade fever. This all started in Nov. here it is March and still one visit after another from hospital to doctors.  Has had elevated liver enzeyms, high phosphate blood work and low lymphocyts, initally low grade fever with elevated heart rate, constant pain some days more than others.Hyda scan showed galbladder fuction 6%, scope showed multiple ulcers and sweollen intestinal track, since taking medication for ulcers todays scopes indicate ulcers have began to heal.  The doctor has taken several tissue samples and we should have biop results back in a few days.  He is thinking she has some form of IBS.  No day for her is pain free 63 days of missed school.  Today while at childrens hospital for more test they asked that I sign a release to place her medical records into a study for adverse reaction to gardasil.  And to set the record straight this vaccine is to prevent HPV virus and not even all forms just a few. A simple routine pap smear can detect these and they can be treated.  However the lasting adverse effect of the vaccine may very well be life long.  A 12 year old looking forward to life long pain.  Not worth it my book. By the way also now 3 other young girls with severe medical issues that develeopled after the vaccine.  Glad to hear that some have no issues but seriously how can you call what is happenning just a handful. This was reported to VARSES and we were told that most reports are coming in from individuals not doctors, I do know that my daughters doctor got on the phone and reported this as well as I called myself to be sure.

I called my doctor and she said it had nothing to do with the shot. I was afraid of getting the other two, but I didn't want to mess my body up by only getting one. The same exact thing happened with the next two shots. My doctor still insists that it had nothing to do with the shots, but I think it's a little too coincidental. I have had many health problems since then, including headaches and autoimmune disorders. ",5

"i recived the shot when i was 21, i was already sexually active my dr never tested for any stds. 24 hours after reciving the shot i was admittied the the ICU at our hospital. I had a rash that looked like red mumps every joint on my body had swollen and locked in place. it was extremly painful, and after two days worth of testing i was told i had liver damage from the reaction. i've seen several dr since and noone can tell me why i had this reaction or what in the shot caused the reaction i know i almost died and would advice against getting te shot. ",1
Very informative,5
My daughter was given the first shot on Aug. 10 she was due to start her period on the 12. the PA insisted that she get the shot due to the she was in there for a std test. She never asked if there was a possibility that my daughter might be pregnant. she test negative for std. she never had her period. she was five days late just spotting. she has had pain in her lower abdominal. She has had symptoms of early pregnancy. So i took her back to the Dr for a blood test for pregnancy and another std test. this time the pregnancy test was neg. but she has chlamydia. Needless to say i have no clue what to do. with what i read here everything could be explain by the shot. Thing is if she is pregnant and the test are wrong the treatment for the std could do a lot of harm to her and if she is carrying the baby. so i would not get this shot and my daughter is not getting any more nor is my youngest. the bad thing is my daughter and i were trying to responsible. and all then pa can do is make my daughter and i feel bad about getting tested and push this shot.will not happen again,1
"I got three rounds, when scheduled, all of Gardasil before any sexual activity (before I even made out with anyone!) However, years later I've found out that I have high risk HPV (a strain that can lead to cervical cancer). I don't want to discourage anyone from using this, I think you need all the protection you can get. Nonetheless, contracting high-risk HPV even after this vaccine is very possible- it happened to me. ",1
"My doctor gave me the third injection a month before it was due. I wonder if that means anything. After my first two doses it was found that i tested positive for nuclear antibodies, or ANA with 1:160. I read other places that this vaccine can cause autoimmune problems. I'm going to the rheumatologist to get  a diagnosis. I will never know thou, if Gardasil had anything to do.",3
I got my first shot yesterday and was honestly really scared from the reviews I read on here but it was actually not bad at all. Doesn't hurt anymore than an tetanus shot. I woke up with a minor headache this morning but that was it. Get the shot if your doctor suggests it would benefit you.,5
"I was the first one in my community to receive this treatment when it first came out.  I work in a healthcare facility and have for 6 years, therefore I have had much chance to discuss this treatment with my physicians. My OB/GYN is one of the most respected in the area and she recommended Gardasil to me.  I had all three of the series of injections by the end of 2006 after I had my baby. I was 22 at the time.  I had absolutely no side effects whatsoever, and haven't to this day. There are 20 reviews here compared to the millions of girls who have received the treatment.  I urge you all to remember that people are 100 times more likely to complain about something they dont like than they are to spread the word about a good product.  Spend time researching the product and consider your own personal health before making a decision about gardasil.  There are side effects just like with every other medication. You just have to decide if you want to deal with them or not.  Personally, I figured a sore arm is better than cancer.",5
"My daughter has received 2 of the three shots. Since her second shot, 3 months ago, she has not had a period. She's gained 10+ pounds, has cramping, back pain and nausea. She is not getting the last shot. Her dr says a missed period would not be caused by this shot. Clearly, his is wrong!",2
"I got my first Gardasil shot today, my shoulder started spasming and it hurt really bad. After a few minutes i almost fainted, now i have a fever. supposed to get two more i dont know if i'll be getting the other ones though.",4
"I'm 21 years old, I got the three shots,two and a half years ago. After the third one I started becoming dizzy all the time and eventually began fainting every single day for over a month. I saw several doctors for this and they tried many different medications to help stop the fainting. I stopped fainting everyday when they prescribed me Metoprolol and Midodrine, but still fainted occasionally,maybe every few weeks. This effected me in college tremendously and I had to move home. I am still paying medical bills for doctor visits and prescriptions. 22 women in Austrailia have died from this vaccine. Yet in the United States they keep it on the market, why? Because our country is run by money and drugs.",3
"Had abnormal pap., HPV negative.  Decided to get Gardasil.  1st shot site hurt, 2nd shot I felt like I had mild flu for 2 days, and 3rd shot no side effects.  Wasn't covered by insurance, cost me $450.  ",5
"I'm 21 and received my first shot in April 2010, had zero problems. I went and got my second shot in June and everyday since then I break out in severe hives. I have outbreaks in the morning and night and have seen an allergiest and the cause they say is due to the shots. Chronic hives is due to auto-immune disorders and the shots have weakened my immune system hince why I break out everyday. Tonight I had to go to the ER because my top lip was swollen like a ballon. Thankfully I do not have to take the third shot, but I wish my doctor wouldn't of pressured me into getting the shots. Sadly I have to take steriods and antihistamines everyday which also have bad long term effects when taken after a certain time. My life is so stressful thanks to the shots. I can't even get the dosage out of my system so I have to live with hives everyday...thanks Gardasil IM!",1
"62 yr old female,developed gential warts. Used Aldara cream to clear the warts. My partners urologist suggested the gardasil vacination to prevent the re-occurence of the warts. I had the 3 shots and it was the best thing I ever did.  I guess that guardasil  has not been recommender for the older generation,(who knew) but the dr allowed for me to have the shots. Never had any adverse affect from them.",5
"I am 24 I had the shot when I was 21 the only symtems I experienced were headaches here and there and fainted once and other than that no extreme symtoms. However, after i got the shot I had two abnormal paps, 2 colposcopies, and then now for the past 2 years later everything is great and normal and I have had two normal paps and it has helped tremendously with other HPV conditions. I reccomend it to all young girls who are sexually active.",4
"My daughter has received her first injection back in Mar10, after the injection she experienced dizziness, nausea, and felt faint.  I believe she did get her period a couple weeks after her first injection but now she is late for her May period.  I'm freaking out because she is 14 and god help me if she is PG, keep in mind she is only late about 3 days but she usually is regular. She swears to me up & down that there is no way she is PG & I even taken her for a PG test and it came out negative.  I've been trying to figure out what she has done differently that may have caused a missed period.  So I remembered she just recently got the HPV vaccination, that was highly recommended by her doctor.  I did notice she got a few small red dots on her back and neck that looked like chicken pox..and so I started to research and found all these reviews, I hope that the missed period is a result from HPV vaccine.",1
"I am a 24/F now due to get my 3rd and final shot of Gardasil, but I am NOT going to get it. For several months, I have had mystery stomach/abdominal and chest pain for which I had separate (inconclusive) ER visits. I had a CT scan that came back normal (other than an ovarian cyst, which was not the cause of the pain - different area). Normal EKG. Normal blood tests. I am appalled that these negative effects are not given attention and I was told there were no side effects when my doctor pushed this vaccine on me. I wish I had never gotten the first two shots, since I am engaged and therefore extremely unlikely to ever contract HPV anyway. I urge you, reader: Do not get this vaccine!",3
"The PA pushed me into getting this.I should of stand my ground and said no!  A month after the first shot my period became irregular and I started having really bad cramps and heavy flow. I have always had my period on time unless impregnate.(I have three kids.). That went on for 3 months and the doctor told me that it must be stress and gave me samples of cymbolta. Which idid not take. Then I tested + hpv and had precancerous cells.I was treated for that. My period were still irregular and cramping bad. I went in to have a nerve block done on my stomach area and they had to check and make sure that it was not a hurnea. In the sanograhm they found out I have PCOS. This has all happen in the time of 8 months after taking the first shot of gardasil. I did not take the 2 or 3. I have three kids and now I am on hormones to try and help me be fertile.I think the Gardasil is a contribute to this. I now do my home work on meds and shots that the doctors give. You can always go back to the doctors office and get it. I think the FDA need to do more study on this. I think the long term effect is dangerous. Rememeber the FDA approved Cigs. ""Doctor"" is a job and if they don't push the meds they buy the loose money. Have to keep in mind medical field is a bussiness too! There are a very few docs out there for the right reason.",1
"I just got my second shot today.  Although I feel a little drowsy today (and did after my first shot as well) that is the only side effect I have experienced.  There are a lot of horror stories on here from people with bad side effects but don't let them scare you.  Do some research before you decide to get the shots, and weigh the benefits with the side effects.  And make your own choice.  Most of the people on here having terrible ""side effects"" probably have other conditions or medications that caused them.",4
"My daughter has received her third injection of this drug and she has experienced headaches on and off for the last six months and her periods are irregular and cramps are much worse. She received third dose two weeks ago and has fallen in the shower twice and has dizziness alot and black out spells daily. She has had a headache for a week and nothing works to take away the pain.We have had a cat scan, bloodwork, heart scan, EEG amd brain MRI. So far all the test come back clear. I am so upset I let her get this vaccine and am sure she is suffering all of this due to it! DO NOT let anyone you know get this shot and do not take any more shots if you have started! This drug needs to be taken off the market and this company needs to reimburse all of these patients for all the tests they have had to take.This is terrible all our girl's are suffering so much!!  ",1
"The day after receiving the 2nd shot, I had the worst migraine of my life. I went to urgent care two days later, but the meds they gave me didn't help. It has been 2 years now - I have had daily headaches and migraines ever since. I have seen 4 doctors, tried several medications (& I’m not one to take medication) and made many lifestyle changes to cure the headaches - nothing seems to work. All the doctors say it has nothing to do with this shot, but I never had a problem with headaches before. I think they need to do more research & test cases before continue giving out this shot.",3
"I received my first shot a month before I left for college. My arm was sore, but no major side effects. Then I had my annual pap smear which the last ones I had came back normal, but this one came back abnormal. I was shocked. I got my second shot  3 months later and did fine with it. I then went back to my gyno who then redid my pap smear and it still came back abnormal. I'm on my way to get cervical cancer. Needless to say but I did not get the last shot. I believe this shot makes your chances of getting cancer higher not lower. I would not recomended this shot to ANYONE!!!",1
"I am 15 years old and 7 months ago at my annual check up my dr suggested to mom that i should get this vaccine. The first vaccination was fine; no side effects. The 2nd vaccination, 3 months later, i could barely left my arm for about 5-7 days but that was it. On dec. 15 i obtained my last vaccine; dec. 14 was the last day of my cycle. It is now jan. 31 and i havent gotten my period. (I am also a virgin.) Could it be the vaccine has this side effect because the dr did not tell me about this effect but i have read other women with this same problem.... ",3
"Like many others reporting here, our daughter has had multiple health issues as a result of the Gardasil vaccination.  She was only able to receive two of the three shots before her health went downhill.  Please research this vaccination thoroughly before you allow your daughter (and now your son) to get it.  If your daughter has experienced health issues related to Gardasil, please report it to Vaers, the gov't agency for vaccines, 1-800-822-7967 ",1
"This vaccine should be pulled from the market.  There are girls experiencing way too many problems after being vaccinated; my daughter is one of them.  She was perfectly healthy before she was vaccinated.  After her second shot, her immune system went haywire.  She is now allergic to everything, has Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and hasn't had her period in a year.  Regular MD's seem too busy to realize what's happening to too many girls.  The reporting system, VAERS, is terrible, and too difficult for people to access.  It is my opinion there are many girls wonering what happened to their health after this shot.",1
"Hi, I am a 29 year old woman from Australia.  At age 26 I had the Gardasil vaccine.  A few days after the first shot, I became nauseous and weak to the point I could not even pick up a magazine or hair-dryer.  My vision became blurry and I started experiencing a skip in my heartbeat.    My doctor said I had a heart condition and it was not related to Gardasil.  So I had the second vaccination.  My conditions persisted so I refused the third vaccine (even though my doctor insisted that it was not the cause).  I did not have a heart condition (as confirmed by a heart surgeon).  Therefore, the doctor put my symptoms down to a disease of the heart..but he never really knew what it was.  Shortly afterwards a cyst grew on my ovary.  Within a year after the two Gardasil vaccinations, I got a condition called ovarian fibromatosis (basically a very big ovarian cyst).  My doctor thought it was ovarian cancer so I had an emergency operation to remove it.  It was not cancer thank goodness and thankfully I did not lose any ovaries (they originally told me I may need a hysterectomy if it was cancer).  My doctor doesn't know what caused the cyst, he doesn't know what it was exactly and he doesn't know how to prevent it (I had the best gynecologist surgeon in Australia).  It's now 2010.  I still feel very tired and I still get very dizzy and experience blurred vision.  I'm going back to the doctor shortly to see if the cyst has returned.  I don't know if my symptoms were a result of having the Garisal vaccine, but I was a very fit, happy, healthy, and switched on woman before the vaccine.  A week after the vaccine, it all changed…   Belinda (Jan 2010)",2
"I have had all 3 shots and no major problems, just the usual side effects. the first one i was just sor and somewhat ""sick"" for a day, withthe 2nd shot i almost passed out within an hour of getting the shot and felt sick again but it went way within a few hours. With this last shot, I was fine until 3 days after the shot and i began to notice that my glands were swelling mainly in my neck and i just didnt feel good at all but within 48 hours i was back to normal. My doctor said it could be just the side effects or i could have had a virus that was going around but it was nothing to worry about. Personally, I fee that the benefits out weigh the side effects that i experienced.",5
"I recently received my second dose of Gardasil. I am not allergic to anything other than the active ingredient in acne medication. I had absolutely no reaction whatsoever to my first dose. I got my second dose yesterday and the only difference is that my arm hurt worse this time. My arm still hurts now, two days after the dose, but I consider that to be normal. I also feel pain in my hand (on the arm that I received the injection in) in my palm and fingers, but it is minor, bearable pain. I consider this to be a very minor reaction. I am surprised to see how many people suffer extreme reactions as I have not had anything remotely like that.",4
"My 16 yr. old daughter has had all 3 shots and has headaches almost everyday. We have taken her to 3 different doctors, has had CT scan, xrays, ultrasound, etc. All results said normal. Does anyone else experience this?",3
"I am not losing my job because of the side effects of this shot... i only got 2 of the 3 shot and now cannot stand more than a few minutes, get dizzy all the time, blackout, have heart problems, and constant pain. Nobody told me the side effects. I am glad i did not get the third shot because I may have died.",1
"be very cautious.  my daughter was administered this shot,  her immune system was effected.  she now has lymphoma hodkins disease.  that is CANCER of the lymph nodes!",1
"I got my first shot in April. It was injected into my right arm. I was fine for the first few minutes, then all heck broke loose. My head felt like it was spinning,  and my vision when blurry sort of. Then I broke out in a cold sweat. I asked my mom if I could lay down, which I did. Then as I laied there, I felt this fuzziness start in my feet and move up my body and in to my head. This fuzzing noise entered my ears and sounded like acid was head burning things. I was realy freaked out at this point but could not say anything because it was painful and naeusiating. This stayed like this for about ten minutes. Then I fuzzing left the way it came and I felt very warm afterward. I finally sat up and was really weak. I could barly lift my purse and walk out the door. This weakness also lasted a good two weeks It also did not help that I had two other shots in my other arm right before I got this shot. After this experience I never want to get a shot again. I am fighting my mother tooth and nail not to get the second dose. I am now four months over due for this shot. I recommend not getting this shot. ",2
"I am great with shots. They don't scare me at all, I don't get nervous and they never hurt. I received all my shots in my arm and the last one hurt like a b****. But the other two didn't hurt at all. After my last shot I didn't have my period for three months, which was scary. Now I am doing fine and don't have any problems. The only reason I am ""somewhat satisfied"" with my experience is because of missing my period and the pain of the last one. ",5
"I had this injection a week ago. For the next two days I had the runs, and nausea, then it passed. Now, tonight, I am broken out in hives all over my body that are itching me to death and my head is pounding. My ijection site is hot and itchy. Very scarey! I am positive that it's the vaccine, never broke out like this before. I've had nothing but trouble since I've gotten it. Thanks to this I may have to make a trip to the ER tonight. Do NOT get this shot! I got it free because I did a survey at the hospital about cervical cancer and thought I was getting lucky due to not having any insurance. Lucky INDEED! The day I got the shot I felt, I don't know, high and disoriented for the entire day as well. I didn't suspect this shot until the hives, though, then I read some more reviews of others who are going through this too. I wish they had explained the risks to me better. I have a habit of trusting doctors too easily. Someone pray for me! This is my first vaccine and I'm definately not getting the other 2!",1
"I was involved in the research study for the Gardasil vaccine.  Because of my mother's medical history, and other reasons my GYN discussed the study with me and I decided it was in my best interest to take part in it.  Having no doubt that I was doing the right thing.  It's been over 4 years now, and I am doing perfectly fine.  My PAP's are all normal!  I really had no side effects from the vaccine, other than a little soreness in my arm after the injections.  I am on YAZ birth control, which is not a strong estrogen b/c, I am not obese and I don't fit in any of the other criteria that would make me not a candidate for the vaccine.  I am 19 & 1/2 years old.  I am proud to say I helped many young women by doing the research study.  I was actually thrilled that the vaccine got approved before my final follow up visit.  Very rewarding!  ",5
"im not a big fan of shots to begin with! but i know how important it is to have this vaccine. immediately after i was given the shot, i felt slightly nauseous/lightheaded. but thats just how i am w/shots in general. i asked my nurse about the sideffects of gardasil and she assured me that they arent as serious as they have been portrayed. most sideffects are usually general sideffects w/vaccines. the only ""sideffect"" ive had to date is tenderness in the area where the vaccine was given (in my upper arm). i hope this finds to be useful!   ",4
"it sounds like i'm one of the only people that had an easy time with this drug! I did a little research before starting this treatment, and went ahead and recieved the drug because it prevents cervical cancer. I've had a few headaches here and there, but i've had them alot growing up, so I can't blame the drug! The shots hurt for like 10 minutes after getting them done, and i haven't had any discomfort or anything after receiving them!!!! I recommend this drug because it does prevent 4 forms of HPV and cervical cancer.  If you wanna ask anymore questions about it from me, you can email me at [email protected]!!!",5
I received my first shot on 8/4/09. I passed out from this shot and since then have experienced extremem dizziness and nausea. My arm still hurts and the soreness has now gone into my shoulder and neck. I even broke out in a rash. I would hope that anyone reading this will research Gardasil before taking the shot. Unfortunately I did not and assumed it would be a could thing to get. I was wrong!!!!,1
Felt like alcohol injected in my skin! I couldnt sleep very good and it made me very naseated! That sure beats getting cancer tho! Temporary symptoms only. The next day I was fine!,5
"I thought this shot burned worse than a tetanus shot. The worst part was that I was allergic to this shot and got the worst hives after wards. My whole body was stiff and sore, even with being on allergy medicine I couldn't sleep. I really hope that the outcome is worth it in the end.",1
"Since my first shot I have experienced headaches, numbness in limbs, lazy eyes, difficulty sleeping, problems breathing and flu symptoms.VERY VERY Achy all over.",2
My daughter received the shots when they first came out.  No side effects other than the typical ones with intramuscular injections.,4
"OMG!!! I got the 3 vaccines and i didnt get any side effects. After a while I started to have trouble getting my period, nowthe only way I can have it is if I take birth control.... I CANT LIVE ON THEM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE! If any body had their period ""lost"" due to this please let me know, because i read a few post and i know there are more women & young ladies out there with this issue.",1
"My 18 year old daughter got the shot at her first ob exam last Wednesday.  She can not lift her arm or pick anything up with that hand.  She is now, not quite a week after running a 102 temp, with flu like symptoms.  Severe headache.  I pray we have not made a terrible mistake in taking this vacinne.",1
"I 20 years old and recieved my first shot 2 days ago at 10am. That same day around 8pm I began to develop flu like symptoms. The next morning my muscles ached so bad that even if someone touched my skin it would hurt so BAD! I had a low grade fever as well. That night my fever went up to 100.5 and symptoms became worse. My glands in my throat are swollen, my body aches sooooo bad, i feel SICK, and my fever is still present. I WILL NOT GET THE LAST 2 SHOTS AND WISH I WOULD HAVE RESEARCHED THIS BEFORE I LET MY DR. TALK ME INTO IT! Before I let them inject me I specifically asked if there were a ny side effects and they told me no. I feel lied to and betrayed by my dr. I do not recommend getting this vaccine! I just pray I will get better soon, I can't deal with this much longer!",1
"I received all 3 vaccinations about a year ago and I have not experienced any of the side effects discussed here. The injection itself was quite painful, but most vaccines are. Please don't let all of these reviews discourage you from getting this vaccination. I actually work in the pharmaceutical industry and I know for a fact that if any of the subjects that were involved the clinical trials for this drug (about 1500) were having those symptoms, the FDA would not allow the use of the drug. It is unfortunate that so many women have experienced these problems, but I really think that they are not associated with the drug.",5
I as well became very ill from this series of injections I refuse to let my daughter get this someday. It is an awful dangerous drug.,1
"My daughter has taken the second shot of Gardasil im. She is currently in the hospital with major side effects. First day after the shot she experienced numbness in her hands and arms. Third day her stomach area went numb. Forth day she has numbness from her neck down. The doctors have taken all of the normal tests for paralzysis including MRI, x-rays etc, and have found nothing. Currently they are taking a spinal tap and feel that Gardasil IM is the cause of this side effect. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DAUGHTERS get this shot. ",1
"My 18 year old daughter has had all 3 Gardasil vaccinations -- no reaction after the first 2.  Within a week after the 3rd one, she started experiencing chest pains on her left side, sometimes radiating to the right or down the left side of her back.  Every day for the last 100 days, she has had 4-6 chest pains (some that are sharp enough to take her breath away) and exhibits anxiety that she did not have before the last vaccination.  The pain is not prompted by physical activity and can not be reproduced by pressing on her chest or breathing deeply.  She's had an EKG, MRI, blood tests (all normal) and was prescribed prednisone.  Now the dr. wants to do some more extensive blood tests and run a CT scan.  I am convinced Gardasil is the culprit and am praying that the pains will dissipate soon and that there are no long-term repercussions.  I so regret that my daughter was vaccinated with Gardasil and in my opinion, under NO circumstances should anyone put their young daughters at risk with this vaccine.  If you don't believe me, go to: http://www.medications.com/se/gardasil   ",1
"My daughter has had the shot and is having alot of problems since she got her first dose. She is now having fainting spells, dizzyness, headaches,. Due to all this she has been in the hospital and has had all test done such as ekg, eeg,mri, echo, and we are now wairting for the mri results today. Doctors don't know what is wrong with her and cant find anything wrong. I told the nerologist about this and she says shes going to look into this. ",1
My daughter went thru the series of shots and after her 3rd vaccine she experienced headaches every day We finally took her to emergency room after 5 days they ran blood work brain scan and nothing turned up. She is still dizzy having headaches and feeling anxious and tired all the time Has anyone else had the same results ? They told me these were not the side effects for this drug Yet before the 3rd shot she was feeling fine.,1
"Last year my niece received the shots.  Her life changed suddenly after the 2nd shot.  She has fainted while in school and blacked out, suffered from migranes, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain & body aches, shaking, stroke like symptoms, shaking uncontrolably.  Numerous visits to doctors, neurologist, hospitals.  Almost a year after she has now developed a reaction to any sulfur or products containing sulfites.  Whe have gone to the hospital 3 times, doctors and we have to set up an appointment to see an allergist. Certainly the drug maker and doctors should do someting about this.  Too many problems and a young person going through all of these changes makes you think if it was all worth it? ",1
"I just got my first shot 2 weeks ago. The shot wasn't too painful, but i felt dizzy minutes after. I experienced horrible stomach pain, nausea, and diarriah.I have also been having cramping since. I read an article listing all the side effects including death, and have decided not to get the other 2. I highly recommend not getting this shot!!",1
I'm not really sure how exactly to rate this drug but I read a lot of the reviews and decided to tell my small part of the story.  I have had 2 doses of this vaccine and did not experience many side effects.  I did have soreness around the injection location and my whole arm felt very tired and limp but other than that I was fine.  My second shot was in Sept 08 and I am scheduled to get my third dose on Jan 2nd.  I am now a little worried as I am typically very regular in my monthly cycle but I have yet to start since the end of October/beginning of November.  I am not currently on birth control nor have I been sexually active in the recent past.  I'm not sure if this is a result of the shot or not.  I have felt like I was going to start and instead of have heavy clear discharge which has happened several times in the last month and a half almost two months.  Please let me know if anyone else has experienced this.,3
I had my first shot a week ago and I am still having pain at the injection site. I'm not sure if that's normal. I've never had that happen with a shot before. I feel a bit achy but I'm not sure if I'm just about to catch a cold or something. The other reviews on here are freaking me out a bit about what I'm in store for with the next two shots. Hopefully this is as bad as it gets. I'm 25.,3
"My niece had the shot, and she is 18 yrs old and now she found out that she is pregnant. I heard that it is harmful to the baby. She got it about 1 week before she found out. What should we do?",5

"I took my 1st shot in Nov/DEc07 ,inspite my reluctance and persistence  by my OBGYN it was not painful but I experience a lot of fatigue, pain in my legs and arms, I also felt numbness in my arms and feet.I took my 2nd shot in June(yes i was late) I have missed my periods twice since then, and have had very painful periods, I have also experienced chest pain, skipped heartbeats and dizziness. I was advised by my Dr to discontinue and hence I am not taking my 3rd shot......I wanted to know if anyone else had experienced these type of problems?? I would not recommend this shot as we do not know how effective it is and It has so many complicated problems. I have visited a cardiologist since then and he has assured me that my heart seems fine. I am still missing my periods and that is not a good sign.",1
"I have had no side effects with my first two shots. Yesterday I recieved my last one, I feel horrible. I feel achy and not like myself, I feel very tired. what could I do? ",3
"  I have had all 3 shots and no serious side effects from it. I have had real messed up periods, missing on the months that I had the shots. The third shot was the worse pain out of all of them, some bruising but no swelling or serious pain.   I had posted this a few months ago... I since have gone back to my doctor and it was not from gardisil they have re-assured me that theres no way that can be from that. I have found the real reason and feel much better.  Since getting the shot however sex is very painful, and very uncomfortable. It really burns and I have been looking into cause its so bad I hate to have sex anymore. I dont know if this is from the shot or if I am just looking too into it cause it began aroudn the same time. The dr told me it was jut a phase at first but it shouldnt be goin on this long so I am due to go back again. I am just wondering if anyone else has had or heard of this problem before?",3
"I went to the doctor's office by myself on the morning of my first shot. The nurse injected me and I didnt experience any side effects what so ever. I even drove home and went on about my day. It's been almost a week after and still not experiencing any flu like symptoms or severe headaches. However, What I've read recently makes me question whether or not I want to continue getting these shots. It's a little disconcerning. Why would so many DRs push this vaccine if theres reports of really bad side effects?",2
I got my 1st shot when I was 20 with my 1st pap test. I was hesitent on getting it but I am glad I did. I have had no side effects. I have had all 3 shots. I do have a tip for all of you who are thinking about getting it. My tip is rub the cite of injection after the nurse does it for at least 5 mins. My arm was so sore for 3 weeks after i got the 1st one. I didnt want to move it. If you rub it and lift weights with the arm you got it in the pain will be gone in a day or two. My dr. said it was probably because I would the medication into the muscle. I got the 1st shot only 3 month after it being out on the market. I was hesitent because of it and felt a bit talked into it but i would do it all over again. As bad as it may hurt MOVE YOUR ARM! ,5
"I hated this shot. I just started my first one a while ago. I was in the worse pain ever afterwards for a typically shot. The day the injection, I got horrible hives on both of my arms that itch like no other. Then my groin started itching uncontrollable along with my back (almost like the worse sunburn ever). Lastly I got a bad cough later and sternum pain. I reacted pretty bad to this shot. ",3
"I am 25 years old and just received my 2nd shot.  I had bad side effects from both shots.. A few minutes after the injection, I became dizzy, extremely lightheaded, weak and off balance.  Fatigued is a mild term.. I felt unwell all together, and had difficulty driving after.  My Dr. insisted I get these shots, although I have already been diagnosed with HPV, as a way to prevent other strands of the virus.  I would not recommend this..Long term effects are unknown, and who knows if it really works.  Not worth the 24 hours of discomfort.",3
my grandaughter  has warts  on her hand and wrist. how do we get rid of them.,5
"I have had all three shots and have had no side-effects yet. I had the last shot in August 08, is there still a possibility of the serve side-effects (fainting, low blood pressure, becoming paralyzed) still?",4
"I wrote back on 5/19/08 about my 16 yr old daughter.  She has since been hospitalized again for fainting and now low blood pressure.  Is this reaction going to be long term???  Her current Doctor informed us ""she is one of the lucky ones.  She isn't parallyzed!!!!""  Please research this vaccine heavily before making the choice that could severly affect you/your childs life!  I sure wish I had and I would hate to see someone else make the mistake we did.",1
"I just got the first shot yesterday, and I do not plan on getting the other 2 shots. I originally just went in for a pap smear and my doctor asked if I was ""interested"" in Gardasil...I replied yes (I was vaguely thinking about it but didn't really want it), not knowing she meant interested in getting it right then. I had thought about it but wanted to do more research first, but next thing you know she says ""ok ready for your shot?"" I was already bewildered after my first pap smear and so did not refuse. Now I wish I had said no because I've done research now and it just doesn't seem like there is enough info out there to establish that this drug is safe or has any long-term effectiveness, and I'm reading about all of these horrible side-effects...I am concerned about people saying they've missed periods, could this drug make women sterile?",3
"After reading patient reviews, I was anxious about possible side effects. Talked to my doctor, she still highly recommended it. I got the first shot yesterday and fainted immediately after the injection, likely due to anxiety. No pain, swelling or itching at site of injection. Feel just fine today. I plan on getting the remaining shots.",3
My daugther was 1 month before her 17 b-day for her first shot. She hadn't stasted her period as of that time. The day after her first shot she did. Her doctor said it was just a odd ball thing and not to worry. She hasn't had a period since it's almost been a year. Has anyone heard of this problem?,4
"I started the treatment in January of 08. Got the last shot in July 08.  I have had absolutely no problems or side effects.  The only complaint would be burning and soreness at the injection site, but that's it",4
"11 yrs. old, sore arm. pain at injection site. first shot. medication rating to soon to know.",3
"I have had all 3 shots and no serious side effects from it. I have had real messed up periods, missing on the months that I had the shots. The third shot was the worse pain out of all of them, some bruising but no swelling or serious pain. ",3
"My daughter, who is 11, completed the series with absolutely no problems.  She said the first one hurt, but all shots hurt.  She actually was mature enough to make sure she finished the series on time.  I have also received the series at my own choosing and cost (over 26) and I had no problems.  Perhaps it is the one who administers the vaccine that makes it less painful.  There are only 21 reports here all with some side effects.  Over 8 million or so have had the vaccine now and the RX info has not really changed.  Your daughters would probably pass out if they had to have a colposcopy.  They may avoid that now by having received Gardasil.",5
"I am 21 years old, received my first injection april 25 of this year, shot didn't even hurt, arm ended up sore for a day or two but not even as bad as a tenus shot. received second injection june 27, shot felt a little more like a tenus shot and my arm was sore for maybe 3 to 4 days.. so other than sore muscle i havent had any side effects whatsoever.. I wont need my third injection til october but am not a little scared because of so many people feeling sick.. but if its just going to give me a sick day and make my risk of cancer a lot less.. i think it just may be worth it.",5
"I got my 1st dose on May 23, 2008 along with the Depo-Provera birth control shot. I've been having so many differ side effects that I'm going crazy. Nervousness,fatigue,headaches,hair loss,no appetite,depression,mood swings... Please look into it before you get the shot",1
"Just got my 3rd shot yesterday. As far as I can tell, I haven't had any adverse reactions to it besides soreness and a bruise once at the injection site.",4
"My 19 year old daughter had the first 2 injections with no reaction other than soreness at the injection site.  Yesterday she had the third injection.  She developed extreme headache, fatigue, dizziness, fever to 101, and this morning passed out.  The headache is persistent despite ES Tylenol q4h and Aleve q8h.  Had I researched this immunization and read these reviews prior to the injections we probably would have opted not to get it.  I urge everyone contemplating this immunization to please research it thoroughly.  I'm not sure how you can rate the effectiveness of this medication...",3
Why do people continue to receive this drug with all the severe reactions going on?  There have been 11 deaths already associated with this vaccine.  And reading all the adverse reactions on this board really makes me wonder why the drug companies & the FDA is hiding this?,1
"My 16 yr old daughter has been sick ever since she recvd her 1st dose of this vaccination 1-1/2 mo ago.  She has fainted several times, VERY fatigued (sleeps 12-16 hrs/day), dehydrated, headaches, vomiting, numbness in hands, joint pain, hair loss, and low Corisol Level.  She has been to the Doctor several times and hospitalized once.  We have chosen not to continue this vaccination for either of our daughters.  It is not worth risking their lives.  We keep wondering what the long term affects are.  Some of these symptoms follow other diseases such as MS.",1
"My 23 yr old daughter just had her 3rd shot-broke out in a rash on arms 3 days later and legs,generally not feeling well for 2 weeks now- muscle ache, joint pain, nausea - no vomiting, pain in the palms of her hands for 2 days and a severe headache that just lasted 4 days. Has been to the ER twice- all tests normal - blood and MRI. She did not have adverse reaction to the first two shots. This is scary. I wish we had researched this more.",1
"Received 1st vaccine and didn't have any major problems.  Kind of feels like a Tetanus shot.  Other than mild soreness, no side effects.  Worth the pain if it prevents cancer. ",4
"I am writing this for my neice who is 12. After the 1st shot, she has had stomach pain, vomited twice and severe headaches. We took her to the emergency room, doctor said it was a virus. She is due too have her 2nd shot in a week. Last week we have noticed severe hair loss. We are trying too get an appointment for the Doctor. She is normally a very healthy child. The hair loss is really upsetting us. It has come out by the roots in handfuls. ",1
"i recieved the first shot on march 5,2008 the next day i vomited and was dizzy and could not hold a conversation was very confused.  went to the hospital they ran test and was not sure what happened a month later i was diagnosed with absent seizures.  i dont recommend this shgot to any one with out looking into all the lawers that are trying to put to gether law suits over 4600 people reported adverse effects and that was last year.",1
"I had the first two shots and did fine.  The pain at the injection site was minimal.  I had the third shot on thursday, and a few minutes later my arms started to go numb.  I was already driving on my way home.  My hands became so numb that I couldn't even hold the steering wheel, and my whole body was shaking so badly. Then severe dizziness set in, and increasing difficulty swallowing and breathing.  I barely made it to the emergency room fast enough.  When I got there it took me three attempts to grab my cell phone to call my mom.  The doctors at the ER gave me steroids to keep my throat open, and lots of antihistamines in an IV.  Yesterday I was still dizzy, and got another numb sensation in my hands, and my muscles in my legs were really sore and I had a fever.  Still had some difficulty swallowing.  I have never had a bad reaction to any medication ever in my entire life.  ",3
"I had my first shot of Gardasil about a month and a half ago. I didnt experience any flu like symptoms, but i havent had my period yet? I'm not on birth control, nor am i sexually active... anyone else have this happen? I'm going to call the doctor in the morning.",3
"A few weeks after recieving the second shot, I came down with severe, Flu like symptoms with a 102 degree fever, to the point I had to go to the emergency room. I'm not sure if this is related to the shot, however I do know that after recieving the first shot, I missed my period. I thought it was due to missing a birth control dose, and my doctor and nurse both agreed. However, after recieving the second shot, I missed my period again- this time with no miss birth control doses. Has anyone missed their periods?",3
"After my third shot I got incredibly sick. I got headaches so bad I couldn't think or open my eyes, extreme fatigue, sharp belly pains, inability to keep down food, diarrhea, and fever chills. I ended up losing 6 lbs in a week because I couldn't keep anything down. I went to my doctor who was concerned with my headaches, so I had a CT scan done. The CT was normal so it was ruled a vaccine injury. I advise anyone who has problems to report it to VAERS! You're not alone!",1
i didnt really have any bad reactions that i can remember after taking the first shot. just swelling at the injection site including pain and nasuea. The nasuea continued for weeks after. im getting my second shot on monday 02/18. did any of the symptoms occur after the second shot? please let me know.,4

"My 15 year old daughter hsd her 2nd injection yesterday and passed out or had a small seizure at her drs. office. I had originally taken her to the drs. due to a cold/sore throat.  They took her temp, 100, and decided it was safe for her to have the shot.  She hit her head very hard on the tile floor in the drs.office, because incontinent, and suffered a severe headache last night and most of today. I don't know if she suffered this effect due to the fact that she was under the weather to begin with.  I found the experience very frightening and would be interested in knowing if anyone else has suffered this kind of side effect.",3
"i got my 3rd shot on monday then yesterday (wednesday) i had a really bad headache all day, took some excedrin before i went to bed but the pain ended up waking me up in the middle of the night and now (thursday 9am) i still have a headache but not as bad, it dosent list headache as a side effect but i never get headaches its the only thing i can think of, has any1 else experienced something like this?",5

I think I may take her to the ER.",5
"So far I have received the first two infusions.  I had an infusion reaction after 18 mg of drug infusion on the first day, but was quickly stabilized and the infusion (100 mg) completed without further events.  The second infusion (900 mg) was uneventful.  Prior to my third infusion my blood test showed than my white count had dropped from 145.2 to 1.8.  That 1.8 consisted of 0.9 lymphocytes and 0.9 neutrophils.  Because of the neutropenia my third infusion has been delayed for a week, or until my blood counts recover acceptably.",5

"new drug just approved nov. 2013. my husband had CLL for twenty years....but never needed treatment. Watch and wait. Last two years his platelet, WBC count wacky, up and down out of normal range. Also on and off night sweats.  Last Feb. platelets went down to 17 and he was treated at MD Anderson Cancer clinic in Mesa, Az. Since he had never received any other treatment, was put on a regimen of Obinutuzumab (Gazyva) plus Chlorambucil. He has one more cycle to go. At this point, never a sick day..no side effects at all.  Blood work looks good.  Platelets now up to 114.  WBC and RBC still a tad low but overall he is well and has tolerated these drugs unbelieveably well.  He also is on Acyclovir every day and Bactrim three days a week to help wack away any infections.  His magnesium did go down a bit so had a couple of infusions of Mag.  Now he is on Magnesium pills which he currently is taking every day.Mag is now in normal range. He does experience some slight constipation at times but keeps this in good control by taking Senna over the counter med....., a natural laxative prescribed by his Triage nurse at MD Anderson.His recent A1C test was 5.9.  All his liver function and kidney numbers are fine.  Hoping for a good remission to the CLL.",5

Have been fighting Ovarian Cancer for 3 years.  Have lymph node involvement since 2010.  Flare up after only 2 months post 6 infusions of carboplatin/taxol.  Only had two treatments in 2 months because of the neutrapenia.  This is my third round of chemo and all three have cause different side effects.

"Gemzar/Carbo combination for 3Neg Br Ca mets to lungs. Worked great but too hard on my platelets. Took a 3 month break, have progression but can't go back onto this regimen. Tolerated it very well, no problems other than the platelet count. No Neulasta shots given.",4
"I've only had 2 doses so far.  The first time I experienced severe headache and nausea related to the head pain.  I was not given anything to boost my white cell production, so they could see how I would react. My white cell count dropped so low that I was hospitalized for 3 days. It took 4 weeks for my neutrophil absolute count to get above 1.5 to be able to get the 2nd dose.  The 2 dose was given with a Neulasta injection immediately following the infusion.  I started with a headache within 24 hour.  The pain included my eyes, bones of my face, my head and neck,  A nurse on my care team told me it sounds like a migraine.  It lasted, non stop for 5 days.  Today I am pain and symptom free. It is 6 days since my treatment.  It is too soon to know if it is working or if these symptoms will continue.  I intend to try it for 3 months before deciding if it is worth the pain.  My plan of treatment is to receive Gemzar every other week, since I reacted too severely to receive it 3 weeks in a row, then one week off as originally planned. ",1
"I think my mother is alergic to this drug. tumor got smaller but still has high activity. After treatments she has very bad sob, weak, panic from no air.Has taken antibiotics and prednizone for the breathing to no avail so I think she is reacting to the gemzar in a negative manner.",3
my husband has been taking this for 3 months and his last ct scan showed a decease in size of the tumor.  He does not get any side effects and is tolerating it very well so far.  He has been on several chemo drugs and I hope this will get the cancer under control.,4
"Have been on Gemzar for 1 year; tumor has shrunk and remained stable. Have has no nausea or side effects except for occassional low white or red blood counts. I get one shot and am ready to go next time. I take G. for 3 weeks on & 1 week off. Get a CT scan every 3 months; also my CA19-9 level has came way down and I feel so much better than before starting chemo. Have even gained back my weight but appetite is good so I'm not ready to diet yet. Tumor was too close to celiac artery for surgery so don't know what's down the road as far as surgery goes. Energy level isn't quite as high as it used to be but it's pretty good. I give all the glory to God and the prayers on my behalf, that Gemzar has given me another year of life.

I have had three CAT Scans during this time and the NHL has significantly impproved.  I have had low blood counts though during all these months and treatment.  I have fatigue which bothers me the most, probably because of my low blood counts.  I have another CT Scan scheduled tomorrow - 11/12/08 and hope I am in remission again and can stop the chemo.

Started back with 20 mg and worked back up to the 40 mg while taking Viberzi 2xs a day. This IBS drug totally turned things around for me! I have an appetite again and rarely have any issues with diarrhea. ",5
Side effects were mild initially and most have subsided except for one.....diarrhea.  It is getting better considering I have been on the medication for 6 months.  My dose is 30mg.  ,5
"Because of side effects, mainly diarrhea and weight loss, my dosage was reduced from 40 mg. to 30 mg.  I gave it a 5 star for satisfaction because it's working!",5
Diarrhea continues to be problematic the day after taking the medication.  Teary eyes and redness around the eyes are most annoying also.  I am taking the medication every other day. However these are minor compared to the benefit I am experiencing with this drug.,5
"I have been on Gleevec Since Jan. 2009 for GIST.  I was first diagnosed in 2003 and had stomach surgery. Five years later second surgery when cancer spread to my liver.  Several months later I was put on Gleevec 400 mg daily.  First shock was the cost.  $69,000 and 10 years later I am cancer free.  Doctor won't use word ""remission"".  I am grateful to be well.  However the side effects are devastating: six years ago I had several iron infusions and since then have monthly B12 shots, am closely monitored for anemia.  I have constant extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, weight gain and my biggest complaint, severe muscle pain and weakness.  I walk with a cane or walker some of the time, cannot walk any distances, have to sit often, have to rest between chores, must sit while doing some of them (cooking for example). I am unable to work full time.  If I have a day of excessive activity, I need next day to rest and recuperate.  I remain in care of doctors as they agree my complaints are side effects of this drug.  I am now on 200 mg daily of the generic.  No change in any of the side effects.  Drug still expensive.  Yes, it saved my life.  I know that. My quality of life is dramatically changed from the medication and I all always resent that. ",5
"I had a 5 cm Gastrointestinal Stroma Tumor removed from my stomach about a year ago and have been on Gleevec 400 mg from bonhoa.com since Nov. 2017. Main side effects are occasional muscle cramping that can be intense, mild periorbital edema, mild-moderate nausea. Most worrisome for me is a very low ANC (absolute neutrophil count) that is being closely monitored. Hope everything will be okay. ",4

"after 16 months on Sprycel, I experienced both pleural and heart effusion so was shifted to Gleevec. 6 weeks in, rash, stained teeth and dry eye with chronic conjunctivitis.Too soon to evaluate effectiveness, about a month away from first BAL with new drug. More later",4
"Three years almost to the day since I was initially diagnosed. Dx'd in Accelerated Phase at 18% blasts (almost Blast Crisis), and my spleen was severely swollen. This is my third type of TKI inhibitor because I just can't seem to tolerate them, although I did get about a 5 month stretch of remission at one point from the second one I was on. When I came out of remission it hit me hard though. Within a matter of 4 months I went from 5% blasts to 42%. My side elects are: mouth sores, nose bleeds, uncontrolled abdominal pain in left upper quadrant under ribs, extreme bone and joint pain, extreme fatigue but also extreme insomnia,dehydration, loss of appetite, weight loss, extreme night sweats (sometimes I have to change in the night and lay a towel down where I'm laying in bed), shivering, cold/clammy, ptechai blood spots/rash, severe unexplained bruising (I can wake up and find a softball size bruise on my leg just from sleeping alone), occasional gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, and brain fog (I live 6 blocks from the grocery and have forgotten half way there where I'm going only to break down crying and call my husband to help me). I'm not a candidate for a marrow transplant, so even continuing on the medication my survival prognosis in blast crisis is one year or less. If I stop taking the meds it will progress faster, but I won't have all these side effects. If I keep taking them, it will help me squeeze out every last day possible, my quality of life from side effects will be crap. I'm stuck and have no idea what I should do.",3

"4 years on Gleevec. had a 15 cm GIST removed, the drug stopped the growth and killed 50% of the cancer cells. Now 3 1/2 years cancer free. Side effects are manageable, mainly abdominal bloating. ",5
"I have had few side effects with this medication and CML has been in clinical remission since being on Gleevec for six months.  I have now been on it for 18 months.  After 6 months on the medicine my cardiologist noted reduction of heart function or ejection fraction from 55% prior to Gleevec to 45%.  After 6 more months of treatment, heart function declined further to 40%.  My oncologist was considering changing medication when I opted to seek another opinion at M. D. Anderson.  Fortunately, I was referred to a cardiologist there who monitored CML patients when Gleevec was being evaluated back in 2000.  He had observed similar heart function problems to mine in patients who had had bypass surgery or stints (I had bypass in 2009).  They found that a common beta-blocker blood pressure medicine restored  heart funtion to normal within a few weeks.  He prescribed Coreg for me and my heart function returned to normal in only one week. I am able to continue by treatment with Gleevec, I just have to add Coreg to my list of medications.",5
"I have taken gleevec for 6 years but this year I'm dealing with blurred vision ,bacterial pneumonia and blood clots in my lungs .just praying this goes away.",5
"I have been on 400mg daily of Gleevec for 8 years following surgery to remove a GIST.  My overall experience has been excellent.  Clean scans for 8 years.  Only apparent side effects have been persistent and painful muscle cramps in hands, arms, legs and feet.  16 oz of tonic water with quinine daily has reduced the cramping significantly. Has anyone experienced hair loss with long term use of Gleevec or hemorrhaging of the small blood vessels in the whites of the eye?  I'm experiencing both but don't know if they are due to the Gleevec.",5
"I was diagnosed in 2009 with a GIST of the duodenum that had spread to my liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, small intestines.  I had a modified whipple procedure and started Gleevec.  I lost 60lbs and was sick all day every day for about the first two years.  Now, four years out, my nausea is controlled by phenegren for the most part.  I still have bad days, but feel much better.  I have been told I will have to take Gleevec for the rest of my life.  But so far, so good.  Grateful to God.",5
from a100% positive test for cml to a99.9% neg. test in30 months. 400mg daily  side effects are severe shotness of breath & swelling & pain in lower legs &ankles.,5
"I have taken Gleevec since March 2003.  I went into remission early on, and am overall pleased with results.  If no insurance, med would be $9100.00 per month...crazy....help from PSI with co-pays.  Side effects are bothersome, like diarehha, nausea, fatigue, but at 69 I am grateful for life and the Gleevec.  Bone pain, leg cramps, feet cramps and Drs. don't ever seem to address these side effects or recommend anything to help them.  Overall very pleased with blood results on Gleevec.",5
I have side effects of Gleevec that are not comfortable but the drug is apparently doing what was expected.,3
"I have an Epson 9 mutation, so I intake 800mg per day. side effects are notably strong, that is edema, anemia but...are there ways to reduce these side effects? ",3
"Diagnosed in Dec 2009. Chemotherapy, six treatments and stopped for risk concerns. On Gleevec for 30 months and in partial remission. Cancer % of blood very low on BCR ABL testing. Gleevec keeping me alive and for 70 still able to do many limited physical things. Unfortunately I am tired, have bone pain and muscle cramps on a daily basis. The diarrhea, eye and leg edema has subsided over time. I am hopeful the same will happen to other side effects. I am grateful to be here and to be enjoying my family. It is a difficult existence when compared to how life was before the leukemia and their support is what keeps me going. I encourage those with similar physical side effects to share the info with their family physician as they are able to prescibe helpful medications to deal with these problems. I take Zofran to help with stomach problems, flexeril for muscle cramping and immodium for the diarrhea. Advil helps with bone and joint pain. There are several new medications similar to Gleevec on the market. If your side effects are too severe maybe you should try one of those. Talk to your oncologist. As a final note. Without Gleeveec to fight the leukemia I would not be here  to write this comment. That in itself says a lot about use of the medicine.",4
"rash early on, subsided at about 2 months. runny stool. anemia early on. increased greens intake helps.",5
"Diagnosed age 66. Am now 69, in full remission. Usually tired, and nauseated after dosage if I don't eat first. Sure am glad I have job and medical insurance, considering the price of Gleevec.  Patent ends in 2015 I think. Maybe I can retire then!  Good luck to all!",5
"Diagnosed december 2009. Chemo without complete remission. On gleevec 14 months and achieved complete remission. Problems are diarrhea, muscle cramps and tiredness. None are incapacitating and I am glad to be here and enjoying each day.",5
This drug has been a life saver for me. The only downside has been diarhea. So I try to get more fiber in my diet.,5
"My daughter has been taking Gleevec for almost a year now. Blood results are good, infact dr  says shes in blood remission. But she has alot      of bone pain, muscle cramps, sleeps 12 to 15 hours a day, no energy.",5
"I was dx in Nov 2003 with CML and within 2 years I was achieved molecular response. I""m very thankful that my doctor recommended thaking this drug over chemo. ",5
"After taking gleevec for 60 day's,I had a pet scan and  the tumors shrank about 90%.This is a wonderful drug. ",5
This medication has worked for my husband for the last 6 years.,5
"I was diagnosed with CML in December 2005, upon learning of high white blood cell count at my 8-week OB visit (2nd pregnancy). I did leukapheresis, as my counts were 170's & had a baby on board. After a bout with sepsis in February '06 and 11 days in hospital, my counts (thanks be to God and all glory to His Name) were NORMAL!!! About 2 months after giving birth, my counts began to creep up again & I was put on the Gleevec. 400mg was too strong & 300 was too weak, and so I'm on 350mg/day.   I do have bouts of nausea and headaches, occasional diarrhea, once in a blue moon I get cramps in the legs. I've had no swelling or any other adverse reaction to this drug.  I find that my nausea can be treated with Wintergreen LifeSavers (traditional peppermints don't work as well for me).",5
"Been on this for over 2 years.  It's been a definite Godsend.  My blood counts went from an enormous and very scary high to a count that put relief and hope back in my life.  I can't say enough good things about this drug.  Some side effects, but nothing like being without taking it.  I had a great deal of problems getting insurance to pay for it. They kept rejecting saying that it was more cost effective to go with ""traditional"" methods.  I often wonder if others have had to battle the insurance companies in this form or any other to be able to receive this drug.  Since I don't know many others who are actually on this, I can't seem to find any answers on this.  In either case, I'm happy to report that this drug is doing just great and I don't think I could ask for more.  Very grateful to know its available for us.",5
"I started on Gleevec 9 2005 I have had issues most all have I also had to have a iron infusion after being on it 3 years my iron level got low and the BCR test or CBC did not catch it they had to run a iron test not sure what it was but I was so weak I couldnt get out of bed evenn though for months I told them I was having issues they jusst brushed it off. I have now severe joint pain inner and outer leg and feet cramping If I keep blankets on legs year around I get very few cramping. my platlets were over 1,000,000. when I was diagnoised I had had a surgery 6 months prior and they were 480,000 but no one told me to watch this I could of easliy had a stroke .I caught it in time now they are having  many issues with it failing after 5 years so please keep details reports and let your oncolist know your concerns.These Dr are human if you dont like the answer dont take it its your life control everything. God Bless us all may we live to be old ! watch all chemicals and radition items cells micro and test all cause damadge.",5
"I was diagnosed in Feb 2006.  Have been in full molecular remission since Feb 2007.  Could have bouts of nausea every time I take it, but have been taking Reglan with it and that, along with dr.'s approval of 6 days a week dosing, is not a problem.  Have constant diarreha.   At last visit, doctor said this will be a lifelong medication, but that's fine with me since it should give me a long life that I wouldn't have had without the Gleevec.",5
Gleevec maximize my life.I am very happy now a day's. I have no any side effect except some weaknesses.,5
My CML went into remission after taking 400mg for a year.  Major side effects is CHRONIC TIREDNESS and bouts with diarrhea.  the drug has saved my life.  I just wish I had even just a little more energy which would make me feel like I am really living. Living with extreme tiredness is very frustrating.,5
"I was put on this medicine in 2007 after doctors removed a stromal tumor which came all to pieces inside my stomach. So far I am still getting good CT scans, without taking the medicine it would probably  come back within 6 months., it has been over 3 years. I have several side effects, swelling under eyes, shortens of breath, cramps in legs,hands feet or anywhere I have a muscle, but when I go to the cancer center I thank God that I am not taking chemo or radiation. I can deal with the side effects as long as it works. The medicine is very expensive, I could not afford to take it if I did not get assistance. So every day I count my blessing and thank God that I have just one more day to enjoy my family and friends.   ",5
gleevec restored my wbc to normal range after 3 weeks of 1xday treatment,5
"Diagnosed in the chronic stage & have been taking it for only 2 months. The wbc went to normal range i week before end of the 2 month period.  Side effects almost zero, just slight facial puffiness below eyes and infrequent but slight diarrhea.  Am grateful for the ""miracle"" pill and honor those who work so hard in these fields. ",5
"I've been using Gleevec @400 for four years. Lots of side effects, including watery eyes and weight gain. But the weight gain is because of the amount of food we need to take before the medication to avoid the nausea and the vomiting. Eventually you'll overcome most of the side effects. Thanking God and Dr. Druker every single day.",5
"I was diagnosed with CML 2 years ago. I was in remission after a year of taking Gleevec. Side effects are mild. Some days I get nauseated, other days I don't. I have found pretzels help with the nausea. ",5
"I have been on gleevec for about 9 1/2 yrs. now.  Praise Jesus - I'm still here! It took 8 months for me to go into remission.  I am allergic to gleevec.  For the first 4 years or so I experienced diahrea instantly every time I took it - along with a feeling of weakness, nausa and tiredness (like low blood sugar).  Fortunately, I do not have these symptoms all the time now.  I developed neuropathy pain within 6 weeks- bone pain and muscle pain.  This is successfully managed with gabapentin.  I gained 60 lbs and now have sleep apnea and am now pre-diabetic.  Swelling around the eyes started early on - still there. I never expected to see age 53 after diagnosis and must say  I am blessed beyond belief!  Certainly, no one can say they enjoy the effects of CML and treatment but I truly am grateful for the time I've been given and how I the Lord has taught me to lean on HIM.  God is sooo good!  Gleevec is the tool the Lord used to keep me here... I praise HIM for it! I hope you do well with it.  God bless you all.. ~P",5
"i had a bonemarrow transplant in ""97"" feb. it was good for about six years, then i relasped. started on gleevec in ""03"" had a bad reaction to it, was in ICU for 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. scary. since then everything is fine. counts are good, and i'm doing fine.",5
Makes me very ill.  This treatment is outragously expensive?  Without Insurance I would be dead because I couln't afford treatment.,5
This miracle drug has kept me alive since I was dignosed in 2003. I probably had every side effect that was listed when I first started taking this drug.  I still have major bone and muscle pain and sometimes it still makes me very sick at my stomach.  It seems to help if I take it right before I got to bed at night.,5
Gleevec saved my life,5
"Just the occasional nausea, but otherwise no serious side effects. I have gained some weight because I have to eat a full meal with the drug to avoid nausea.",5
"ESTOY TOMANDO GLEEVEC DESDE ENERO DEL 2008, HE TENIDO ALGUNOS EFECTOS SECUNDARIOS COMO: PIES HINCHADOS, OJOS ROJOS, PIEL ROJIZA Y MAS CLARA, DIARREA FRECUENTEMENTE, DOLORES MUSCULARES, Y DOLOR EN LA PARTE MEDIA DERECHA DE MI ABDOMEN. DEPRESION POR EL ALTO COSTO DE MI ASEGURANZA, PERO SE JUSTIFICA CON LA FELICIDAD DE ESTAR AL LADO DE MIS HIJOS. GRACIAS A DIOS Y LOS CIENTIFICOS.",5
"I have been on Gleevec since 2002. It saved my life. I was no longer tolerating the Interferon Alpha or the Hyadrea (after four debilitating years)and began entering the accelerated phase. With Gleevec there were some side effects, but only with the higher dose (800mg),like nausea,vomiting,tireness,weight gain, swelling, sensitivity to heat, and hair loss. These were minimized by reducing the dose to 600mg at day and dividing it(300mg morning and 300mg at night, taken with food). Most side effects are now gone, although I am still experiencing hair loss and kept the extra weight. Overall, I feel great. Eating a balanced diet and drinking plenty of fluids (water and natural fruit juices)also helps.",5
There was bearly any side effects and went into remission after two months thanks to doctor Nick,5
I have been on 400 mg a day of Gleevec for some time. Everything has been good and my Dr has taken me off. It is an amazing drug but expensive. I do have 9 pills left that I do not need. I would gladly mail them to anyone that would like them. Just e-mail me at [email protected] and I will mail them to you ,1
"My husband has acute lymphocytic leumkemis (ALL) & is Philadelphia chromosome positive.  Diagnosis was not very promising, but he has been on gleevec for about 3 years now.  His PCR rate is .01%, so it is working.  The side effects give him fits, though.  Muscle & joint pain, cramping in the legs & hands, stomach issues, back pain & overall weakness. He is dealing with this & we are grateful for his continued remission.  He will probably have to take this drug the rest of his life.",5
"Gleevec has saved my life! 6yrs in remission. It worked for me instantly.I have been at zero for all of my 6yrs. Thank God,Thank Dr. Druker for giving me my life back. Side effects too few to worry about! Life is Good!!!!!! ",5
"I have been on Gleevec since 2001, after a failed remission on Interferon.  I to have dizzy spells, broken blood vessels in my eyes, swelling around my eyes and ankles, and the main one is fatigue.  But; I am very grateful for the drug.  It is better than the alternative. Have been in complete remission for 7 years.",5
"I'm writing this for my deceased husband who was taking the Gleevec for CML.  He took it for 6 years and was in a hard remission according to his oncologist.  He died from sudden death syndrome October 13, 2009 due to heart damage from the drug.  Fair warning to all.",4
"Discovery of GIST 4 years ago, stage 4.  Gleevec has been a life saver. ",5
"Started taking this prior to it's FDA approval on study.  I'm alive and well, minimal side affects.",5
"I was lucky in that my CML was caught fairly early. I started on Gleevec about 10 months ago. The worst side affect is the pain in my stomach and intestines - with a little diarrhea thrown in for luck! Ha! I also have a lot of trouble with blood vessels bursting in my eyes! Makes me look like a monster sometimes. I've had a little trouble with cramps, but haven't gained any weight. I REALLY wish they could do something about the gassy stomach!!! Blood counts are more or less normal. Sometimes, I get some dizzy spells, but the doctors don't think it's related to the drug. I'm not so sure! I'm an American who lives in England, so don't have to pay what sounds like outrageous money! Come on, Obama! Get that national health service going so I can come home!!",4
"I have been taken (STI571) Gleevec since June 13, 2001. I am in a clinical trial, I began with 800 mg/l and reduced to 600 mg/l to reduce the pain I experienced.  I have all the side effects that are common with Gleevec.  I have found that a GOOD fiber supplyment will help with the dirrahea.  The dirrahea has cause me to have other surgeries.  I still do not have the energy that I once had, I am on pain and antidepressant medications. I am able to continue working, I have learned to take the good days as well as the bad and thank god I am still able to be productive.  ",5
I have been on this drug since 2002 and have had little or no side effects.  Occasional bouts of dirarea and possibly some weight gain although I was overweight when I began taking the drug.  I am delighted and grateful for Gleevec,5
"I've been on gleevec since Jan 2006. works well, but a lot of side effects. weight gain. 30 lbs. diarrhea, hair loss, sensitive to sun, tiredness, no energy. bone pain, muscle cramps, and more. but is keeping my blood counts normal.",5
Has anyone experienced high anxiety from taking the drug Gleevec. I have been diagnosed with CML and have taken Gleevec for 6 months now and anxiety has gotten a LOT worse.  Anyone else have this problem and know how to treat it?  Thanks in advance,4
"Miracle drug! Had tumor surgically removed 9 yrs ago. Last year, 5 tumors redeveloped in liver plus more cancer in hip bones. PET scan after 1 month of treatment on this drug showed no cancer-only some scar tissue in liver where tumors had been. 6 months later I'm still taking 400 mg daily with few side effects... mild diarrhea, and some hives.",5
My son who is now 15 has been on this med for over a year. When he first started they had him on 500mg. He had a lot of leg cramps. They reduced it to 400mg and the leg cramps were also reduced. Some days he has headaches and feels tired. But thank God he is in remission and over all doing well. ,5
This drug is a true miracle drug as far as I'm concerned. I have been on it for one year now and I did not experience any side effects other then nasuated if I did not eat when taking the drug.  After taking it for 9 months there was no changes but recently my cancer doctor increased the dosage from 400MG to 600MG as remission was only 82% when last checked but  two weeks ago it was .000l only in my blood. I will have a bone marrow next month to get a more accurate reading.  I too have suffered with diarreha on a occasion but with over the counter medicines this can be controlled. Over all I think this drug is a true miracle and well worth any side effects.,5
"I've been on this drug for alomst 2yrs. I call it the Mircle Drug.  I had some side effects like weight gain (40 pounds),leg cramping and dirrahea. Other than that Life has been GOOD. ",5
"Have been on Gleevec for CML for 6 years, CML in remission for 5 years.  Fatigue is the worst side effect.  Muscle cramps a problem but SloMag (slow release magnesium supplement) has helped a lot.  The other (many!) side effects are a nuisance but better than the alternative.",5
I have been in remission over 6 years with this drug. The only side effect I have had is muscle cramps. It is very expensive but it works. I was on interferon for 2 1/2 years before this and the side effects were much worse,5
"I was on interferon injections for 10 years and began on Gleevec when it was still STL157 (in clinical trial). I went into remission fairly quickly and remain so. The worst side effect for me was diarhea, but the side effects of Gleevec are nothing compared to interferon and it has never lowered my red or white counts below the normal range. I was always anemic on the interferon and got infections easily---a serious viral infection caused me brain damage; that's when I got off the interferon and went to the Gleevec trial. I am so grateful for this drug! My life is pretty normal. ",5
"gleeve has worked well in keeping my white count in control, unfortunately i've gained over 30punds since my diagnosis of november 2007. i'm curious, has anyone had the same problem.",4

"This medication has helped me, but i had to go through a lot of side-effects. when i first starting taking it, i couldn't walk because my legs were hurting soo much. now i have been on this medication for 11 months and i feel much better than when i first started taking it.",5
"I have been on Gleevec for almost 2 years now, and am in complete remission.  It took a bit longer for me to achieve this, but once I did I have stayed there.  Few side effects--nausea if I take it without food, diarrhea, some aching bones, but generally I work full time, take care of my family and raise my boys.  Life is Sweet with this drug--I can't thank Dr Druker enough for inventing it.   ",5
after a year and a half of taking this medicine @ 400 mg per day I am now in remission.this medicine works very well but is also very expensive.that is the only bad thing about it.i have to take it for at least 2 more years so I am hoping the price will come down.this is too expensive $3500.00 for 30 tablets.my kids have missed out on alot because  all my money goes to the medicine but I am still alive thank you jesus,5
Since I have been taking this medication my last two bone marrow tests have come back negative. The tests are not showing any trace of the CML. ,5
"I had a large GIST near my colon, a very rare tumor; I was treated with 800 mg Gleevec for 5 months, and it worked to weaken the tumor cells and reduce their growth. It was removed intact in December 2007. I had minor side effects, diarreah, fatigue, gastro-intestinal discomfort. After surgery, I am taking 400 mg. pills for a year to prevent recurrence of tumor. Gleevec has worked well for me up to now. I recommend it for gastro intestinal stromal tumors.",5
After being on 10 million units sub-q injection daily of Interferon and when Gleevec was passed by the FDA and I was put on it @ 200 mg daily. Within 12 months a repeat BMB revealed that this drug has put me into REMISSION! What a GODSEAND this medication has been for me...,5
"I have been taking this medication since Jan of 2008, so far I have had multiple side effects, edema of both legs, lot's of cramping in the legs and a general feeling of tireness,pain comes and goes in several area's. I hope this medication can help my type of cancer. Will stay on for now.",2
"I can't say enough about this medication. My white count was over 200,000 when I was first diagnosed with CML. Within 3 weeks of taking the medication my white count dropped 90% with the only side effect being diarrhea. I am down to two tablets per day, the diarrhea is occasional and treated well with Immodium and my PH chromosome count is around 1%. If ever there was a miracle drug, this is it.",5
"I've been on Gleevec since Jan, 2002. Been in molecular remission for a few years now. Most of the side effects come and go although I have a HUGE issue with muscle cramps/spams in my extremeties. There are times I can't even sign my name because my fingers cramp so much. Consdiering the alternative, I'll live with the cramping!",5
"gleevec works really well at keeping my white count incontroll, but I have 9 side effects, some I have to take othere medications for, some i just suffer through.",5
"I have been treated for going on 4 years.  I am in remission and doing well. I sort of look like a raccoon sometimes because of side effects effecting my eyes.  Pain, watering etc.  Still some vomiting from time to time but, all in all I am doing great, am able to take hikes, walk the dog and enjoy family and friends.  I feel lucky that I have this medication and wonderful medical support.",5
Been taking for 6 years and has kept it in check.  Very few side effects,5
When I first started using it I was sick and threw up a lot.My eyes are red and always look funny. Some swelling and a lot of diarhea.Lots of aches and pains and low energy level. The drug is working for me though and I am in remission now and doing much better.,5
"At first there are somer side effects like, eye swelling, rashes on legs,arms, and sometime stomach, and edema on the ankles,  these symptoms will taper off.  Your white blood count will eventually get very low and you might get sick with a cold or worsre so you may have to stay away from the general public so you don't catch any thing worse.  This may be a major concern.",5
"I was diagnosed with CML a few days ago.  My spleen was exceptional in size and only then did I know I had CML after hitting the ER.  When I was diagnosed with CML, the doctor prescribed this medicine.  Within 3 days, my spleen was normal size and my symptoms have reversed themselves.  Easy to take in pill form in the AM.  So far I have no side effects.  Without this medication, I would also have the 5 year life expectancy.  But since this pill came along, I was told I can have a full long life.  We will see.",5
No major side effects. Occasional minor skin itching on lower legs.,5
"In 2001 diagnosed w-CML which was unaffected by chemo.  I was told typical life span 3-5 years but along came gleevec.  It has proven to be very effective at keeping my leukemia under control.  It turns out I am allergic to it but take it anyway.  Developed peripheral neuropathy which was blamed on the chemo but I really believe it is the gleevec.  The following health issues I developed may or may not be related to gleevec:  sleep apnea, narcolepsy, neuropathy, diabetes, high blood pressure, weight gain.  I think that about covers it.  The point is this - I prayed for the opportunity to see my children graduate, kiss the face of my first grandchild and be allowed to live 15 more years.  I am blessed.  In spite of all the side effects and other health issues, God has answered my prayers.  It has been 12 years - I have kissed the face of TWO grandchildren and saw both girls graduate.  One is still in med school.  Yes, I feel nausea when I take the drug and itch so I take another pill or two or 5.  12 years of diarhea can be a bit annoying but I'm still able to enjoy my life.  Diagnosed at 44 - now I'm 56!",5
"Tiredness, weight gain,headache.",3
"My wife has gbm and had 8 wafers implanted 2 months ago. She is now having severe bouts of paranoia and delusion. Cant say for sure if caused by the wafers but she had tumor removal surgery, radiation and chemo in the three months prior without these symptons.",3
My wife had this terrible disease and was only given 1-2yrs at the max. She was in remission for 4yrs. I am not sure if it was these wafers or if it was a combination of it with radiation but I do know that we had time together as a family that we cherished because the extra time spent was incredible. I would have to say that these wafers were definitely a part of that extra time. Good luck and god bless. Elvin,4

Low energy, painful muscles and back ache.  My primary tested iron levels and oncologist suggested ferritin levels, which were low.  Started me on iron and Vit. C and am feeling better.  My only complaint is that the oncologist is looking for a source of bleeding (had cat scan and endoscopy) but won't admit that this drug can cause anemia.  Am also taking anastrozole.",5

Once the chemo was done I began the Herceptin for every three weeks and will go thru Oct 2016. I wasn't given the steroid or benadryl for my first dose of just Herceptin and by the second week I was experiencing extreme allergy sypmtoms with runny nose; watery, itchy and swollen eyes. Over the counter benadryl, Zyrtac or Claratin were not helping. I lost my eyelashes (three weeks after my final chemo). The allergy symptoms were so bad when I went for my second dose of Herceptin (every 3 weeks) that I was given the steroid and told to take two benadryl when I got home. The symptoms subsided but losing my eyelashes AFTER chemo was a surprise. I have my tastebuds back and feeling much better than when I was on the Taxol and thought just the Herceptin was going to be a breeze. I guess not. I didn't know that the Herceptin had any side effects. I need to keep hydrating otherwise my lips start peeling and cracking. My hair is starting to grow back and looking forward to my youngest daughter's wedding in May 2016. ",4

I have been on Herceptin since May of 2015 in weekly doses. I'll have it once a week  for a year. No  side affects so far. Has been easy to use.  ,5
"Breast Cancer Her2 positive. They injected me with Perjeta, Herceptin, Taxotere, Carboplatin, Benadryl and a steroid!!! Thank God Chemo is done, now they want to continue with the Herceptin. However, the tumor has NOT shrunk as they claimed it would. I've researched information on Herceptin, and have come to the conclusion it is NOT worth the risk for the extremely low percentage of benefit. (and, so far all of this hasn't done anything but make me sick) Side Effects: Bloody nose, swollen eyelids, runny matted eyes, muscle cramps and twitches, breakouts on my face, bruises under my fingernails, nail pain, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, back pain, kidney pain, extreme tiredness, extreme weight loss, hair loss, inability to smell, changes in taste, sleep interruption, racing heart. We'll see the surgeon tomorrow and get a surgery date set up. I pray this will all be over soon, it's been horrific.   ",1
"Diagnosed with triple + Breast Cancer 1-29-13. I went through Chemotherapy, Apr to July 2013 (Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxol), radiation to breast aug to Sept 2013. Started Herceptin in May 2013 and continued 52 treatments to May 2014. All went well at the start with no side effects but during that time my mitral valve weakened and I went from normal to moderate functioning. I started losing my breath in Feb and by June my legs started cramping up and going numb! I still have this problem today. One more ECG test will tell me if I now need a heart dr. ",4
"I'm a 64 yr. old with stage#2 HER2 positive breast cancer. I have finished Adriamycin,cytoxin,& taxol.  I'm on my third dose of Herceptin.  I'm very thankful the  drug was invented but have had the following side effects.  Severe leg and joint pain, swelling and difficulty making a fist, pain in left eye with eye lid crusting,watering. Watering (intermittent)from left nostril. Fatigue is less than on other chemo meds.  I'm looking forward to my hair growing back and haven't had any signs of cardiotoxicty!  I will be receiving Herceptin every 3 wks. for a year.  If this drug saves my life, so far, the benefits far exceed the side effects which can be managed with narcotic pain relievers.  ",4
"Dx'd with BC 10/2012, R side mastectomy 11/19. Started chemo (TCH) in Dec.  Have had NO problems with chemo OR the Herceptin. 2 sessions of chemo left and then Herceptin until Dec. 2014.  I am very thankful for this drug as it is working and NO heart issues/side affects as I also have High BP, and a mitral valve prolapse.  Everything is going fantastically.  I am praying all goes well with just the Herceptin treatments once my chemo is finished Apr. 3, 2014.",5
I have had 2 infusions thus far and I feel absolutely horrible.  Am looking for the side effects.,1
"treatment every 3 weeks, eperienced slight numbness in big toe and some fingers which goes away before treatment.",5
"The muscle and joint pain and stiffness so many others mentioned before me is present. I have not started the Gabapentin for the pain because I was hoping it would go away. The kind of stiffness and pain I feel (in hips, on the sides of my legs, feet, neck, shoulders, top of arms, waking up with swollen and painful knuckles of hands, knee pain going down the stairs, I also have numbness of my feet and toes, just a touch of numbness in my fingertips)started after the 8 sessions of chemotherapy was done and midway through the radiation. At this point I would have had 5 or 6 doses of Herceptin. Will go on for 1 year with a treatment every three weeks. Immediately after infusion I noticed seeing dark shadows infront of my eyes after a couple of my infusions. Ejection fraction decreased from 72 to 60%. I will pray and meditate that my heart can handle this treatment all the way through.I appreciate that this medication is available (only since 2006-right?). I say ""thank you scientists and thank you supporters of research""",5
"coughing, diarhhea, short of breath..",5
I don't seem to have any side effects from this medication unless fatigue is an effect.,5
My tumor has shrink ,4
"Weekly Herceptin IV since 10/2012 - to continue through 9/2013.  Flushing day after treatment.  Massive abdominal weight gain.  Rapid pulse, difficulty breathing (sometimes)... higher blood pressure and general fatigue.  Bleeding gums.  Hate this stuff!  Guess it's better than having cancer, but....  Dr. doesn't seem to be concerned about ""problems"".  Had 8 months chemo, lumpectomy and 6 weeks radiation prior to Herceptin IV.  Doc says chest pain is radiation nerve damage.  Not sure... can't wait to get it over and done!",3
"A problem i am having, are muscle and joint aches,mainly while i am sleeping!I am 7 months out of taking it. Had the infusion for a year.Good results otherwise",4
"rash, difficult breathing, headache, heart problems, sore tongue, swollen legs and feet, severe itching",1
no problems with using IV herceptin. just completed 2 years of treatment.,5
"diagnosed Feb. 2012, stage 2, triple positive, herceptin every 3 wks. until March 2013.  MY MUSCLES HURT REALLY BAD, DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET AND MY HANDS TOO. I must get a MUGA SCAN every 3 months since this treatment may effect the heart. ",5
no problems,5
The only side effect I have with this treatment is weight gain.  No other symptoms.  ,4
"I had early stage breast cancer HER positive.  I had a lumpectomy and mammosite radiation. I'm also on Arimidex.  I had Herceptin every three weeks for one year.  I am one of the few who have had Herceptin alone - no chemo.  I did have the drippy nose and still have thin, splitting and breaking finger nails.  Otherwise, no problems.  I was diagnosed in Nov 2010. So far, so good.     ",4
"I have been on Herceptin since my diagnosis in 2007.  Supposed to be open-ended.  So far, so good...no sign of recurring cancer at all.",5
"I am frustrated because of the many women who have indicated abdominal weight gain and muscle cramps, yet manufacturer and doctors refuse to accept them.",3
"I was diagnosed with HER2+ Overexpressive Breast Cancer in July of 2011, Bilateral Mastectomy September 2011, 5 rounds of chemo and herceptin starting October 20ll, 5 months of Herceptin left...Herceptin is a walk in the park compared to the Chemo...Swollen ankles, runny nose, achy muscles, shortness of breath at times and fatigue...",5
No problems at all. receive IV every 3 weeks for breast cancer ,5
"16 weekly infusions of taxol/herceptin has not damaged my heart, 5 weeks into treatment my 2cm mass was GONE, mastectomy at the end of 16 wks showed no active CA, the ankle swelling/bone pain is worth the news of my path report.  I an now getting once every 3 week infusion, my fatigue is getting better, my life is becoming mine again, thanks to Herceptin I belive.  Bone pain is nothing compared to the outcome without Herceptin....",4
"I took Herceptin with Chemo for four months.  I was sick 24 hours a day the whole four months and ended up in the hospital twice.  I think most of the sickness came from the Chemo instead of the Herceptin.  Since I only take the Herceptin now I feel a lot better.  The biggest problem now is runny nose, red swollen gums that bleed every time I brush my teeth.  Also, the inside of my eyelids are red and look like ulcers.   Both of these problems started the first week of Herceptin with out the Chemo.  I am wondering if I am the only one with these side effects because I have not read about any of these except the runny nose.",4
Too soon for honest review.  1 infusion with no problems.  No chemo.  70 yrs. old and also MS.  I am counting on it working on the HER2 positive breast cancer.  Chills and fever for 4 hrs. after infusion.  Nothing more after taking 2 tylenol.  Had echocariogram before starting and will be monitored frequently.  Will do this for 1 year if all goes well.,3
"I have been on Herceptin since Feb.2010 I thought I was coming close to the end of it until my Mugga Scan showed an enlarged left ventrical. So I currently have been put on hold. Now I had an echo test which showed a ""leaky Heart valve"" I want to know if this has happened to anyone else? Can Herceptin be a part of this??",3
easy infusion treatment that I have been on for 1 year after 11 months of chemotherapy and have no side effects. Heart scan is done every 3 months to ensure no heart problems.,5
I was diagnosed with HER2 Positive Breast Cancer 2 years ago. Previous to this I had AFIB 1-2x per year and used medication when necessary. After 1 year on Herceptin they had to stop it 4 weeks early because of my AFIB on a daily basis. I have not recovered. I am in AFIB 2-3x per week and am exhausted with little energy. I would love my life back. I had an ablation but that did not help. Did herceptin save my life? I cannot say. I am a shadow of the person I once was. ,2
doctor didn`t give herceptin with chemo.and i was not given proper testing to see if my heart was being effected,3
I was diagnosed with breast ca HER2 pos in April 2010.  I had a mastectomy and did 8 rounds of chemo. I have been on Herceptin for 10 months now and over the last 4 months have been experiencing severe muscle and joint pain along with 2 & 3+ edema to my lower extremities and a 20# weight gain over the past 2 months. If I had  to do it all over again i would not have taken this drug.  The side effects are terrible.,3
Had my treatments 2 and a half years ago and I still don't have my strength back. Still hard to walk very far without getting weak in my legs and have to set down.,5
I'm glad there is something for those of us with E&P negative breast cancer. I'm done with chemo but will receive Herceptic  for 5 more months. I have insomnia and muscle/joint aches but other than that no major side affects.,3
mugas ok main complaint sore knees and feet.,4
"Diagnosed 2/8/10, stage 1V, metastatic breast cancer, ER, PR Neg. HER2 positive.  Began chemo & Herceptin Infusions 3/1/10. had 8 chemo treatments every 3 weeks and Herceptin every 2nd and 3rd week for 6 months & now have Herceptin every 3 weeks. Scanned after every 2 cycles and began to show shrinkage in the first scan.  I had cancer in my right breast, lymph nodes, liver and bone.  2.8 cm in breast and 3.1 in my liver.  No sign of either after the 6th chemo treatment but went ahead and did 2 more cycles to make sure.  9/8/10 = lumpectomy on right breast and on 3/1/11 began my 2nd year with  Herceptin and am told that I will need to continue with Herceptin indefinitely.  Combined with the chemo gave great results with the tumors in the breast & liver, but not without severe side effects.  EXXXXXXtreme fatigue, severe muscle & joint pain continues to this day, very brittle and thin fingernails.  Of course I lost my hair everywhere and the only place it did not return is in my nose.  The hair on top of my head is thick, curly and gray with darker roots. No radiation so far.  Continuing with Herceptin infusions indefinitely every 3 weeks.  ",5
"My mum was diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple 4 years ago. We additionally found out that she was Her2+. She was placed on herceptin for 52 weeks. We completed the treatment 18 months ago, and she seems to be fine.",3
"I have used Herceptin off and on for 6 yrs, since I became metastatic 4 yrs ago. I do have some mild side effects: some foot swelling and mild body aches. I had an allergic rx with the first dose, but have been fine since. I have a very aggressive form of bc-IBC, and I believe that Herceptin has kept me going all this time, along with chemo intermittently.",4
IV every three weeks for 17 treatments; no side effects that I'm aware of.  ,4
"I received Herceptin IV for 17 treatments, over the course of a year from October 2008-October 2009.  It was easy to tolerate and I didn't notice any problems taking it at all.  I am thankful that it is available for triple positive women like myself.  ",5
"I was diagnosed in April 2009 with spread to the lymphnodes. I had a lumpectomy and 13 nodes removed, only 2 positive. They had to go back into my breast 3 more times over the next month until they got clean margins. My breast is now very deformed, but it's still there! I did 3 rounds of chemo and started heceptin. I had to stop herceptin after 3 months because of the muga results. After 4 months I went back on and am now only 2 infusions away from being done. 52 treatments is alot, but if it reduces my rate of reoccurance, the weight gain, fatigue and back and joint pain will have been worth it. ",5
"I don't really know if the drug is working the chemo was ok for 6 mths now con't with Hercepin for another 6 mths. worse complaint is swelling, legs and feet and numbness in the toes.... how do you get rid of the swelling.... gained at least 20 lbs over the course of chemo.... no hair anywhere !!! Will finally see my doctor in 2 weeks ( haven't seen her since she sent me for treatment) maybe i'll get some answers then... Everyother doctor i've seen keeps telling me the same stuff you can read on line.  I wish they would get they heads out of the books and give me some realy information not statistics.....",4
"I have been on Herceptin for 5 weeks and truly it is so easily tolerated. It is givn weekly along with chemo every 2nd week and the results are amazing: after 2 treatments my tumor has shrunk by over 1/2. No side effects but I remain very active in mind and body...the whole key is a good attitude and a fighting spirit. I will remain on Herceptin for a total of 20 weeks then surgery (lumpectomy) radiation and Herceptin for a yr. This journey is soooo doable, not a bowl of cherries but the results and outcome make it worthwhile. I am grateful and happy to be over being scared.",5
"I have had a masectomy in Nov 2009 chemo, radiotherapy and will be taking Herceptin until March next year.  I find the Herceptin is well tolerated except for joint and bone pain...very severe.  I feel like an old lady.  However I have been assured that I will improve after I finish treatment.  I am very thankful for Herceptin.",4
Her2+/ER/Pr-. Ductal with a <2mm tumor.  Onc put me on Herceptin for a year b/c I'm young/ help prevent recurrence.  I do get rapid heartbeats but I have for years and saw Cardiologist who ran tests and said unrelated.  ,5
Easy infusion; minimal side effects - mainly skin and visual reactions. MuGa heart scan every quarter. Lowest EF @ 60% - well above normal.,5
"2003 diagnosed with HER 2 +, node positive. Mastectomy, Chemo, and Herception for 1 yr. Now 2010, Zero sexual tolerance, Neg for breast cancer/ or any cancer. Lost all my hair off the top of my head, will now need to buy wig.  Chemo killed everything, except my soul. ",5
"I have been on Herceptin for the past  6 years after having breast cancer 4 times. This drug works very well. So if your doctor has you on this drug stay with it as long as you can. If your heart can take it the worst thing I can say is sometimes it is a drag to have to go for treatment every three week, and your nails become brittle.  Other than that it is a wnderful drug for those of us with HER2 breast cancer.  I hope this is helpful for you.",5
"i get really sleepy, my body aches, my vision is blurred,and my bowels dont move normally. i also take femara this drug i have to take one pill every day for five years and the herceptin every three weeks.",3
i have had no side affects except for indigestion,3
I had no side effects from the Herceptin alone - had my last infusion 3 weeks ago. It was a breeze compare to the chemo and radiation.,5
"Diagnosed Christmas Eve 2008, Triple positive HER2, twelve months of herceptin treatment, no side effects. ",5
"I have been treated with herceptin for 10 months. My Muga Scans showed no signs of problems with my heart. I had severe fatigue, breathing problems, rapid heartbeats and weight gain that became life altering. The doctors couldn't find a cause, it was Herceptin. I had CHF due to Herceptin and nearly lost my life. The scans failed to show a problem until I was having CHF. Herceptin has helped many people but for a few this drug is deadly. ",1
MEDICATION WORK FOR ME,5
"I have been receiving infusions weekly for four months.  For the past 2 months I have experienced extreme redness, dryness, and tighting of my eye lids. The skin and tissue of my right check is swollen, puffy, red, and extremely dry.   My eyes water often.  My oncologist dismissed it as nothing or a reaction to my eye make-up.  I have worn the same hyperallegergic eye-make for many years.  I have gone four days without any make-up after a treatment, and it is worse.  It seems to get better as the week goes on, and then flares up angerly after my infusion.   Please, has anyone else experienced this.  It is very uncomfortable and disconcerting.",3
"When I first started there were chills and diarrhea.  I receive it weekly because of my rx to drug.  For a while I have been having joint pain but it got a lot worse about 6 months into my treatment.  That being said I am cancer free right now so it is working.  Hence, I will continue it until the end (72 doses total -- 12 with taxol and 52 Herceptin only).  I thank each day I can tell all of you I am happy to be alive.",4
"My BC treatment included the use of Hercerptin IV. My last injection of Herceptin was Dec 2008. Heart pumping action was diminished some but returned to normal sometime after treatment. Side effects seemed to be minimal. I worked all through my treatments. So far I am doing fine with no signs of a cancer return. I think this drug worked, easy to tolerate and I'm glad my doctor included it in my treatment options.",4
"Ever since I've been on herceptin just by itself (without taxotere and carboplatin) I've been in constant joint pain; shoulders, elbows, fingers, hips and feet nothing helps! I feel like a little old lady with arthritis but I'm only 43. Does anyone else feel this way?",4
I was 30 when I took Herceptin.  I was in a clinical trial for early breast cancer patients to decrease chance of reoccurence! No problems and have actually had 2 healthy beautiful little girls since then!  Good luck to all ! I feel Herceptin is a very good drug!,5
"Having a port makes getting infused much easier than an IV. Most important, my tumor has gotten significantly smaller with this medication. It is standard to receive Benedryl with Herceptin to avoid allergic reaction. However since I had to drive myself to Chemo, I forwent the Benedryl because it makes me too sleepy to drive. I said that to make note that I did not find any allergic reaction to Herceptin at all. I was told that it can cause left ventricle damage to the heart, but so far so good, the echo looks ok.",5
"I had a dbl mastectomy, with IDC/DCIS in one breast only, 2cm tumor, ER/PR weakly positive, grade 3, no nodes, no vascular invasion. No sign of IDC/DCIS in area around tumor. I did 5.5 cycles of Taxotere/Carboplatin with Herceptin for one year. I am assuming that surgery alone would take care of this monster but I did the chemo/herceptin anyway because of the her2 positive - I am 3+.  I have 2 more herceptins to go. Basically I feel fatigued and have sleep problems. Heart is holding up at 70% -echocardiogram every 3 months. I would really like to know if 3-6-9 treatments vs one year or 2 years is beneficial? Herceptin has advantages but how is that measured?  It is too bad there is no way to tell if herceptin is 'working' in one's blood sample. If it can cause so many short and long term health problems I do believe there should be a way to tell which women it will have a benefit FOR. Maybe some of us need more, or less, of this drug. The only way we know is by not having a recurrence, and many women who are her2 pos, have never had herceptin also never have a recurrence. Seems a bit of a crap shoot. So - are you scientists working on a way to see if herceptin is having the effect it should on an individuals immune system?  How did one year become the standard?     ",4
"I had a lumpectomy, chemo, Herceptin and 32 radiation treatments for early stage breast cancer.  The doc stopped my Herceptin treatments several times during a one-year period of time due to decreased heart function.  My ejection fraction rate went from 68% with no heart problems whatsoever to 35% a year after stopping Herceptin.  My heart has not regenerated as my onocologist told me it would.  I just had an echocardiogram and it shows I now have mitral regurgitation (which can only be fixed with open heart surgery), ischemic heart disease any several other major problems.  I went from being totally healthy and fit to being fatigued and in constant joint pain.  I am so angry about Herceptin and its side effects.  My oncologist said my heart would regenerate after stopping Herceptin.  After 1 year and 5 months of stopping Herceptin my echo shows heart disease and major heart problems I never had and never expected.  I am now faced with the prospect of open heart surgery.  I am only 58 and extremely upset that this has happened.  I wish I had never taken Herceptin.  Be very careful!  God be with all of you taking this drug.",3
"I was on herceptin for a year, during my chemo and double masectomy.  After 2 months I took a PET scan and the cancer was gone. (it was in 3 places plus nodes) I give 100% credit to herceptin.  I had ZERO problems or side effects from it. It was all the chemo, once that stopped, so did the side effects. I continue to go for MUGA scans and everything is perfect. Herceptin saved my life. ",5
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. I was given Herceptin along with chemo.  The first 6 months I did not experience any side affects.  The next six month I had moderate to severe stiffness in my joints.   I finally realized I was given a steroid the first 6 months thats why I didn't have stiffness. Taking an over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory really helped. It took about 3 months for my stiffness to go away.Its been a year and a half and I feel normal again.,4
"It's difficult to rate the effectiveness and satisfaction of the Herceptin treatment, for I've only been on this infusion for less than one year.  I am experiencing muscle aches and shortness of breath.  The doctor seems to feel this is more the daily dosage of Arimidex, rather than the three-week infusion of Herceptin.  I also take the Zometa infusion every six weeks to help strengthen the bones.  I'm not sure of the cause and effect of either treatment, but the side effects are disturbing.  Hopefully, it will prove to be worth the discomfort.",3
"I had 12 months of Herceptin treatment after 4 rounds of chemo. I just finished last treatment. Compared to the chemo the herceptin was a cake walk. I did feel a little tired and my taste buds were not good for the 1st wk after. I do have severe bone pain in my knees, which I see a pain DR for, other than that I feel good & pray for a great out come. My Dr. had me have a MUGA scan every 3 months & actually my heart went from 76% to 78% which is great considering the history of heart disease in my family.  Over all I have been pleased. I can live with the bone pain with meds.  Bless you all. ",3
"I had 7 months of weekly treatments of Herceptin following chemo(AC and Taxotere).I didn't really have any side effects however,after 7 months of treatments,a MUGA scan revealed an ejection fraction of 28.My oncologist ceased treatments saying I can never have Herceptin again.Sent me to a cardiologist who told me I have congestive heart failure.Sometimes it reverses so I am keeping my fingers crossed.Last MUGA showed improvement and I am due for another soon.I will be 3 years out in June and there is no doubt that Herceptin saved my life.It is a wonderful drug.",5
I have experienced no side effects. My treatments have been very easy. ,5
"oct 2006 i had breast cancer. after four months of chemo i started herceptin in march 2007 with my last 2 doses of chemo. by May, i started feeling worst than i did with chemo.i had all the pain,fatigue,depression, and i did a lot of crying.i also had breathing problems. my doctor told me this was normal and it probably was a rection from chemo. by june my breathing became painful and that made my chest hurt. FINALLY in sept 2007 my doctor sent me to a cardio doctor. i am now jobless and fighting heart disease and heart failure. don't let this happen to you. i did 36 weeks of herceptin. breast cancer was a breeze compared to this. make your doctor listen, i was not given much info on heceptin and my doctor told me it was safe and chances of heart problems were not likely to happen to me. i am a breast cancer survivor,and i am alive thanks to my determination.",1
"I received herceptin during my chemo treatment and now herceptin only for 1 year ending 12/2008. I too had real bad muscle aches after the first couple of treatment and fatigue. But now I still have ongoing mucle aches it is not as bad as the first couple of Herceptin treatments. My heart scans have been good and not sure is the fatigue and muscle aches and chemo brain are from chemo, radiation and herceptin or all off the above from this last year of treatments. I want to know if anyone has continued Herceptin after the one year? I feel like it is working and really don't want to stop and risk a reaccurance. I feel like the herceptin is keeping the breast cancer away. My onco doc said the studies on Hercep do not indicate any longer term use gives better outcomes...Any one have any experience on longer use of Herceptin? Please respond. I can't find any information any where else regarding longer use of herceptin. ",4
"I was diagnosed with stage 2B HER2NEU positive breast cancer in Aug 2002. I had a lumpectomy and underwent 4 types of chemo including Hepceptin in a clinical trial from Sept thru Jan then eht Herceptin for a full year, then 5 weeks of radiation. Yes, there were side effects: hair loss, bone pain, anemia, fatigue, depression..but I am still here and cancer free SIX years later!!! I feel very BLESSED to have recieved Herceptin ( I had a 1 in 3 chance in the clinical trial) and thank God every day for the doctor that developed it!!!",5
i was pleased with the overall effectivness of this drug.,4
I was on weekly Taxol/Herceptin for 12 weeks and am now on a regimen of Herceptin every 3 weeks for the remainder of a year. I have a lot of pain (compounded by Fibromyalgia) and fatigue hits unexpectedly but considering the chemo I've been on and radiation treatment (33) - that's not unusual. My 1st mammogram/ultrasound since diagnosis was clear - so I'm very hopeful that this drug is working. The benefits far outweigh the side effects for me. (I'm also monitored with echo cardiograms every 90 days),5
"I have been on Herceptin since Aug of 2007.  I feel confident that it is going to work for me and the side effects are worth it.  I have experieced fatique,weight gain and overall soreness in my legs.  These could also be from chemo that I finished in December. Can't wait to put all of this behind me!",4
I was on weekly treatment of Taxol & Herceptin for 12 weeks - now Herceptin alone every 3 weeks for the remainder of a year. I have joint/muscle pain and difficulty walking - especially in the morning. Fatigue comes and goes and can be severe at times. I continue to work fulltime and hope this drug is working to kill the Her2+ protein.,3
"my aunt received this drug once  week. each week she would report to the doctor that her cough was worsening, she would swell more, she was hoarse from day one, and never seemed to get any better. the doctor listened to her lungs and told her that there was nothing wrong with her and continued the treatments. after four months of treatment, my aunt is dead. all because a doctor is too stubborn to listen to his patient. to make a long story short, ONLY YOU KNOW YOUR BODY better than any one else. if you feel like there's something wrong, there usually is. keep letting your doctor know that you are not comfortable with herceptin infusion, if you have severe symptoms. don't let the negligence of a stubborn doctor take another life.",1
my doctor treated me with herceptin weekly since dec. 4 2007 and since then i gain 17 pounds in four months and now i am experiencing heaviness and edema in my legs and i could'nt stand up for so long. I will probably stop it on my own if my doctor won't agree with my symptoms. I showed my legs increased about 1/4 in size and i never gain weight that much in my entire life.,1
"my body does not react well, to this rx. As i speak right now, I'm in severe muscle and joint pain. I've told the Dr. , however, he denies the reports I tell him. I'm stopping it myself. That is only one side effect, I have more.",4
"This drug nearly killed me after my third infusion.  By the time my doctor, who dismissed my distress over the phone, would see me in his office, my blood oxygen was 82% instead of 100%.  At 80 you die. My heart was 4X bigger than normal, one lung was filled with water and one was 80% filled with water.  I had ten additional pounds of water in my chest cavity.  I fired my oncologist after I left the hospital a week later.  He refused to admit it might be herception, but the 7 other oncs at the Regional Oncology Center disagreed with him.  Every doctor who has read my chart in the past 2 years (7) have told me it is a miracle I am alive.  They do not know how I made it.  I did have congestive heart failure and was on 3 heart meds for nearly a year.  I am 57-- very young looking and very healthy--  not overweight.  I jogged for 25 years and used speed walking and nautalis after that.  I was not overweight.  Meanwhile, I am still cancer free.  If you are going to take this drug, never let your doctor make you wait five days to be seen if you start coughing. Mine never mentioned an ER, even.  He said it was nervous hysteria making me cough from the phone.  NOT.",1
"I took Herceptin for a year, ending April 2007.  For the most part, I experienced no side effects.  I started training for the Susan G. Komen 3-Day 60 mile walk and began having serious stiffness after long walks (6 miles or more).  It was bad enough that I could barely stand up for a few hours afterwards without lifting up with arms from chair.  I also experienced edema in my feet and ankles on a trip I took to Colorado Springs.  Within a month of finishing the Herceptin treatments, about 90% of the stiffness went away.  I was also taking Arimidex and have been taking that now for about 1-1/2 years.  I still have some stiffness when getting up, but nothing like the Herceptin experience.  It was only when I exercised a lot that I experienced this.",5
"i have been on iv herceptin for 9 months. i have developed high pitched ringing in my head. i have hypersensitive hearing now, never had any problems before herceptin with my hearing and its really beginning to bother me. have also recently had edema in my left arm. my symptoms seem to have occured suddenly. wondering if anyone can identify with my experience as i am considering stopping tx. am supposed to go for a year. having trouble sleeping as well but doc wont help me with that.",2
"I experienced chills after the first treatment and my joints are stiff.(I had radiation for 7 weeks along with the Herceptin so that may be why my joints ache.) Other than that, no problems. I will be on it for a total of a year once I'm done. So far it's been about 3 months. I hope it works! ",4
"I have been on IV Herceptin for 8 months.  My doctor has prescribed 12 months of treatment.  I have experienced fatique, slight nausea and chills for several days after each of my treatments. ",4
I have been receiving IV's for nearly a year now after initial chemo treatment and while I underwent radiation.  I have had no side effects and am very pleased and thankful to have this option available to me,4
My mother has been taking treatments for just about a yr now. She & I are both happy with the drug. She has had a clean bill of health so far.. The only actual side effect she has had with it is slight fatigue & headach. I would recomend it to Breast Cancer Patients.,4
"My 54 year old wonderful wife has been treated with this drug for 6 months and she has tolerated it very well, with no negative side effects. Her CA-125 has leveled off between 35-45 for the entire time. Our oncologist said that Hycamtin does not build up toxicity in the body, therefore my wife can continue to take it as long as it's effective. He also said that the goal is not remission, but simply maintaining the current levels of her cancer. She hasn't felt sick at all, and our lives have been normal, thank the Lord, with the exception of the weekly visits to the oncologist. I pray that this regimen can continue. The infusion, with pre-meds, takes only one hour. ",4

"I began takIng Hydrea two years ago, when first diagnosed with ET.  For a long time I really didn't notice much improvement in how I felt, but my Platelets were coming down to the mid 400's from 800.   I was diagnosed with Melanoma about eight months ago.  I was a little surprised by this diagnosis because Hydrea being a Cancer drug, thought it could have kept this at bay.  I am NED and have continued taking the Hydrea until 5weeks ago when I met my new Hematologist. (Previous doctor transferred to the VA).  He thought I could stop taking for 4 weeks as my Platelets were 412.  Within 2 weeks, I had increased joint pain, the stinging all over pain, dizziness and fatigue.  Last week, my platelets were 720, so he put me back on one 500mg. Capsule a day.  After even only a few days, I noticed improvement.  I have really no side effects except for an occasional mouth sore (blood blister) and thinning of my hair. Well tolerated. ",5
"I have ET with platelets over 1,500.  I started at one pill (500 mg), then moved to 2 and I was just moved to 3 as my count  went back up.  Side effects are increasing a bit with the increase in the drug.  Includes confusion at times, exhaustion and shortage of breath especially in the morning.  Other effects not bad so far.  My job requires a lot of travel and significant analytical work.  I need to nap during the day at least once and I am slower in my work which is frustrating at times.  I feel more lethargic generally.  Not sure if it is ET or drug.  I am glad the drug is working.  I have Crohn's disease so potential stomach issues were a concern so I take the drugs at night with ginger ale and soda crackers and that seems to have kept the stomach issues in control.  I used anti nausea medication at the beginning but do not need it now.",4
"constipation, constant fatigue, dizziness, light headed, shortness of breath, joint pain",4
I have too many platelets but since I have the Jak2 gene variant it is called Polycythemia Vera not Thrombocytosis. I have been on Hydroxy Urea for four years. I have been told I have a six week life expectancy if I stop. It dropped my platelet count from 1200 to 375 (keep in mind some places drop the last three zeros in the platelet count) in four months taking 1000 mg. Hydroxy I am now on 500 mg a day and the count has stabilized. I'm sick to the stomach and very tired a lot of the time and I can't handle extremes of heat or cold. Hydroxy Urea isn't fun but for now it's my only option.,5

"I have been taking hydroxyurea for about 2 years for myleoproliferative disorder.  I exhibit most of the usual side effects, such as fatigue, dizziness, dry skin, etc.  However, since I began taking it, my perfect teeth have deteriorated.  They tend to loosen and fall out, decay, break off and the gums are swollen.  I have dental pain most all the time.  I do not see this in the listed side effects, but I cannot believe that the hydroxyurea is not the cause of these dental problems, as I had never had dental problems before.",4

I have frequent headaches many of whch I simply haveto go to bed also I have edema and pain in my feet and legs, burning, stabbing pain in my feet.

"It seems its effectiveness has worn off.  I am suffering with extremely dry eyes, skin problems, red hands and very dry.  I have been on Hydrea since 1989 and want very much to get off it.  It does not keep my platelets down, in fact they range from 900 to over a million each time I am tested.  Wondering if a prescription of 10,000 units of Vit. A might substitute because of its affects on clotting.",5

Some months my dose is a bit higher.I do have some vision problems from this drug and a good bit of fatigue and confusion (at times). Symptoms are worse when my dose is increased. Usually my problems are headaches, nausea and extreme fatigue. My body does, however, adjust after several weeks to the increased dose.Taking this dose keeps my platelet count between 500-600 thousand. My main concerns are the long term side effects. I am just glad this drug is avilable because without it I would not have a very good quality of life. Very thankful for a fabulous Dr. in Chas. S.C. . An attitude of gratitude seems to make a big difference. The best way to feel better is to reach out to someone else and take your mind off of yourself :-)",4
"My platelet count was over 900,000. Taking 500 mg Hydrea /day lowered platelets to about 500,000  Side effects: tired, small dark spots on tongue. It seems that my doctor has to keep increasing my dosage. Every time I read the label on the medicine bottle that says the drug is toxic and to wash hands after touching even the bottle, I get concerned. I cannot imagine having to take this for the rest of my life. I am thinking about switching to Anagerlide because it is not connected to a risk of developng cancer.  However it does have other bothersome side effects. ",4

Am taking Hydroxyurea for sickle cell disease. It helps very much in reducing the number of painful crisis and hospitalization a year. 10yrs into it my wife for 6yrs was unable to be pregnant she went through all kinds of tests and was told nothing was wrong with her. So I started. My 1st testing was semen analysis and the result was 0 sperm in my semen. So hydrea cause my sperm count to zero.

"I was diagnosed with ET about two and a half years ago and took two 500 mg of hydrea a day. Nine months later I was told my kidney`s were failing.  VERY devestating.  I saw a nephrologist and have been able to stay off of dialysis by keeping a very strict diet.  I switched hemotologists and asked if I could reduce my dosage to one a day and she agreed.  My kidney function went up slightly.  Now that second hemotologist only sees hospital patients and I`ve been assigned another hemotologist who wants me to take Anagrelide 0.5 mg once a day.  This also is bad for your kidney`s.  My main concern is my kidney`s and I`m at a loss as to what to do.  I go in 3 weeks for another blood test.  It`s a hard decision as to whether I want to die from a blood clot and heart attack or stroke, or die from kidney failure.  There are a zillion problems with dialysis and transplant.  ",2

I have several other chronic diseases with many other medications and the hydrea has never been a problem as far as drug interaction. Also have had several surgical procedures with no problems.  I will be on this medication for life and have no problem with that  ",5

"Have been taking over 5 yrs. Had problems adjusting platelet production with immune system.  Platelets up, immune system down. Recently started taking Resveratrol, a supplement. Believe it or not, on my next checkup, my platelet prodution stabilized, though slightly high, but the amazing part was my immune system was well within the normal range which I had not seen since being diagnosed.  Perhaps it may have been coincidence, but for my last 3 checks the results remained the same. I now take 5 capsules a week.  My hemotologist is pleased with the results but will not comment on the use of Resveratrol.",5

"My hematologist tried hydroxyurea on me several times to raise the fetal hemoglobin level in my blood. Each time, not only did it not help, but it cut down my white blood cells a lot. It also has terrible side effects like nausea and stomach pain, and hair loss",2
I've been on the drug for 3 months with little or no side effects.  It has been very effective in the treatment of polycythemia vera,5
"Diagnosed with Polycythemia (a very rare disorder where the bone marrow produces too much blood - red cells.) in 2000 at age of 29 I have been on this medications generic form.  Since beginning this drug to suppress my bone marrow, my counts have remained in normal range.  I initially had stomach upset and hair thinning, but that went away after a few months on the med.  I took the medication for my entire pregnancy with my 2nd child who is now 3 years old after consulting several physicians.  They all agreed that the benefit outweighed any risk of stopping the medication.  The only down side to this mediation that I can speak of is that it's been very difficult for me to overcome a chronic sinus infection.  ",5
"I take 500mg four times per week.  Have been taking it with various doses since 2004.  I have ET--essential thrombocythemia.  The med makes me have loose bowels and I have to eat it with food or it makes me sick to my stomach.  It is scary that there is no alternative and no known cause to my disease.  I also take 80mg ""baby aspirin"" once per day.  HAve to see the hematologist once every six months now.",4

Since Feb '08 those counts have been all within range. Downside is nausea, loss of appetite and strength/stamina seemed to have decreased. Not sure of long range side effects but some reported ones are not too good. For now, this is the best drug to get me to ""long range"".",5

My nails are brittle, my skin is turning dark, my hair is thinning and ever so often I get ghout like u want beleive. There is nothing else I can take for my problem mainly because I have high platelet and it is unknown why. Yes I've taken every test to include bone marrow and nothing. When my count is 1 million that is good for me.  ",4

"Started taking Hydroxyurea 1500mg/day initially in Sept. 2006.  Had to decrease to 500mg/day within 2 months due to bone marrow toxicity and it lowered my neutrophils and white count precariously.  Saw a decrease in chronic bone pain within first 2-3 months of use, however still suffered 2 pain crises requiring hospitalization during that time.  I find this drug to only be moderately effective for my particular case of Sickle Cell Disease.  I have hemoglobin type SS with high F (or high fetal hemoglobin), which it will increase in those with low fetal hgb.  I already have a concentration of 22-23% fetal (F) and 77-78% sickle (S).  I only take it because it can help prevent other complications like acute chest, and seems to guards against organ damage as well as marked progression of Avascular Necrosis, which all can be increased with the number of vaso-occlusive/pain crises you experience.It makes me extremely fatigued.  Currently back on 1500mg/day (as of Nov. 2008) after 1 year of being on 500-1000mg on and off due to neutropenia.  Took a year-long break due to pregnancy.It does increase my hemoglobin after about 3 months of being on it consistently.  My baseline is between 9 and 10.  I have been up to 13 while on Hydroxyurea.  However, despite my hemoglobin being higher, I have still suffered long-lasting crises.  Its really a toss-up for me.  I especially worry about the risk of cancer after long-term use, which hasn't been well documented but the risk is still there.  Who knows just how long that ""long-term use"" is defined by?  ",3
this drug made every nerve ending in my body painful. it brought down the platette count but now my docotrr wants me to go on it agin for 90 days .,3
"I have used Hydrea for over five years and also angrelide, both for an increase in blood platelets. I feel good but when the platelets count goes up, if seems like the hemaglobin count goes down. I am now getting Procrit for it right now. It is all based on the tests, but this is my observation of what happens. I also take angrelide for this condition ",4
"I have used Hydra for years now. My platelet count is watched bimonthly or monthly. I also take Agrylin with it twice a day. I am please with this treatment. Last month, I started on Procrit. I am not sure about this drug. Went today for a visit and did not need it. ",5
the drug increased uric acid and have gout,4
dr. perscribed this medication because i have to many plates the above questions don't pertain because i don't know enough about the medication.,5
Initial 3years saw extreme decrease in vaso-occlusive crises then returned to frequent episodes annually. Stopped taking it for 4yrs and returned to normal dosage regimen of 1500mg/daily. No reductionin number of episodes but reductionin severity of crises. Used in conjuction with new drug not available in US yet (Hemoxin/Nicosan) and Hgb level steady at 9 and Hematocrit steady at 28.

"I started taking 125 Ibrance 3 weeks after starting Letrozol.  The first week of Ibrance I noticed my head was itching, by the 2nd week of taking Ibrance, it was obvious I was having a severe allergic reaction-my face/neck had a bad rash/bumps with my face terribly swollen and itchy -a day later my arms and back began getting rashes and itching.  The doctor took my off Ibrance for a six weeks and may start again at a lower dose.  It took at least three weeks for my face to heal-skin peeled off...scary, ugly, and terribly itchy.  I am waiting now to see if I will try it again.  I have tolerated Letrozol easily-no noticable side effects.",1

Nausea, tiredness, insomnia.  My markers skyrocketed with the first dose, but I hear most drugs do that at first.  Tumors dumping their stuff.

"My Mother had been prescribed Ibrance in Feb 2017 after her breast cancer was discovered to have spread into her spine in a couple spots.  In June, her MRI and scans show that it has spread throughout her spine, her hip, and her ribs.  It seems like it hasn't helped at all and may have contributed to additional growth.",1
"I'm also taking Letrozole and 125 ibrance started 9 months ago only side effect is I've lost almost of my hair. I'm stage 4 it had spread to my lungs and bone so far this seems to be working, if it wouldn't be for my hair you wouldn't know I was sick as I feel great.",4
"Started Ibrance 125 mg with Letrozole in Feb 2017.  That medication burned my hand so bad I had to wear gloves to shower, couldn't touch anything it was a really bad.

Twice I have gotten it a week late.  The side effects have been mild, minimal hair loss, tired feeling.  The Femara gives me excessive amounts of stomach acid but an otc rantidine is taking care of that.",5

"I am on Ibrance and Faslodex for breast cancer metastasis. The first 3 months side effects were mild. After 4 month I experienced worsening stomach problems, diarrhea, loss of appetite, taste of food was affected and I lost weight. The main problem though was my white blood count. It fell critically low. My doctor took me off the medication twice to get the white count up and reduced the dose from 125mg to 75mg. That seems to be working as far as the side effects but I don't know yet how the cancer markers are affected.",4

So present Oncologist in hospital suggest me to buy the generic one from bonhoa.com which price is only 1/8 of brand one. So far works very good. I started seeing my present Oncologist in November of 2014. At one of my visits in 2015 he informed me that my WBC had reached 295,000. When I asked him if there was an alternative to chemo, that is when he put me on Imbruvica (3 pills a a day) -that was in August of 2015.

I think if I get some TLC now, I'll be more ready for the next round. I am worried about my other chronic health conditions (MS, heart murmurs, familial hyperlipoedemia)and how the fevers exacerbate my MS. I'm challenged by side effects.

"Imbruvica has reduced my spleen size and lymph node enlargement, but, to date has not reduced my high white blood cell count significantly.

My grandfather is own this medication and it seems to be keeping the cancer at bay however the side effects are sometimes aweful.  He never knows if he is going to wake up with diarrhea or not.  He had the hoarseness for a while but it has gotten better.  Now he is experiencing coughing a lot.  Cough meds only seem to aggravate it.

I now have severe edema in my legs and feet, something that 2 doctors can't seem to fix. I wear compression stockings every waking moment and they seem to help with the pain, but that's not a cure, just a bandaide. I take 80 mgs daily of furosemide (a diuretic) as a B.P control, but it has done nothing for the edema. Terrible living with ""fat"" feet because I haven;t got one pair of shoes that fit.

Now I'm a firm believer that it will not be the cancer that kills me, but the cure.",5
"I have been on this for 3 weeks. Because it is a small pill it is easier to take. I developed soreness in mouth and cannot hot or spicy food. The skin of the feet is peeling and cracking. Developed hoarseness of voice. Feeling extremely tired.  Previously I was on votrin for 3 months which shrunk the tumor somewhat. Because I developed one new spot I was started on Inlyta. I developed high blood pressure while I was on votrin. When I stopped Votrin, the blood pressure was normalized. Once I started Inlyta , the blood pressure rose again and I am on the blood pressure medication again",3
"I have been on drug for 8 weeks, first scan came back w/  ""stable disease"" status.  no new growths.   Dr now wants to increase my dose to 7mg twice daily. Lots of side effects for me.  Most all are countered by another drug: increase blood pressure: changed HBP drugs,  thyroid problems: increased synthroid,  Diarrhea: now take lomotil,  Fatigue:  still a problem,  Muscle and joint pain: vicodin helps,  voice changes, dry skin, are my major complaints.  But if it keeps the cancer at bay, I can deal w/ the side effects",4
I really don't know yet about effectiveness b/c I've only been on it about 5 weeks. Main side effect so far is moderately severe hoarseness. ,5
"After 2 weeks on Inlyta, my husband experienced a severe rupture in his intestinal wall. Out of the blue. Touch and go emergency surgery, result ostemy. Now on hospice.",1
Took this medicine back in 1991 3x a week for 6 months. Was in a study group of about 20 people. I was 1 of 2 that the medicine cured. Most could not with stand the side affects of the deration of treatment. I thought this medicine would kill me. I do have long term side affects from this medication. I went through mentapaus at the age of 30. However the long term side affects are better than the alternative. Glad progress has been made in regards to the treatment of hep c.and interferon. ,5
"On week 3 of iv treatment for Stage 3 melanoma. Absolutely miserable. Horrific headaches and nausea. Much, much worse than the flu-like symptoms anticipated. Not sure  I will finish the 4 wks of iv treatment. Now liver enzymes are out-of-whack. Trying to figure out what to do....there's gotta be a better way...",3
"ide effects are tooooo horrible. Totally exhausted = can't remember a good nights sleep. Wake up with excruciating pain in hips, legs, neck, shoulders. Ouch = just exhausted. Last night I was over the toilet 5 times but never threw up.  Is there another way? Melanoma Stage III",1
"I was treated back in 2002 for Hep-C.  It was with a another drug for 8-9 months. It was very hard on me.  I was sick most of the time and could not see my kids on some weekend.  I am Type 4 and stage 4 now, as it did not work.  Now my Doctor wants me to go on the latest Genotype 4 treatment and I believe this is one of the drugs again.",1
"I started interferon & rabiveron in 2001. I was on the study program at the time a took the injection & 4pills per day for 48 weeks. Yes, it cleared the Hep C, but since then it's been downhill since. I've had/ have every possible side effect listed. My heart, ended up pacemaker/defibrillator, eye surgery  in both eyes & still have blurred vision, lost bone in upper teeth area, replacing teeth with dentures & last (hopefully) but not least nerve & muscle soreness constantly. Would I use these drugs again, NO...I'd try to find another method of clearing hep C. Unfortunately my quality of like is nil. I got hep C from a bad blood transfusion from thyroid surgery in 1981. I am only 68 yrs old & my body & all these illnesses, makes me feel 90. I have always had a youthful face & body, but now I look much idler than my age.  Horrible, horrible effects.",5
"I'm on A 48 week treatment. Just finished 12 weeks of Incevick. still have about 30 more weeks of Interferon and Ribaviron. I feel Better but it has ruined my life. very depressed, get unbelievable angry.  My kids, wife tell me I am the biggest ass hole they have ever known. my muscle  mass has melted.  Fat and loose skin replaced it. No more abs, feel like I have to keep covered up. Hair has thinned and broke off.  I now have A comb over. ( nice ) I think if I was to die tonight it would not be A big deal. Would be forgotten and soon would be like I was was never here.  ",4
Induction phase 30 MIU 5 days a week for 4 weeks. LIVING HELL!  Maintanance phase 18MIU 3 days a week for 11 months.   Side effects were soooo annoying. Did anyone else have any side effects? How did you reduce them?,4
I was diagnoised with Hep C (G1)in 2005 and started a 48 wk treatment within 4 months. I took Riboviron and Interferon as well as numerous drugs for the treatment of side affects of the medications. I am now 7 years in remission. The treatment was horrific for me and every week when I saw my doctor I wanted to quit. I'm so thankful for his encouragement to continue the treatment.,5
"Got virus from blood transfusion in 1990. took ribavarin daily and interferon weekly for 48 weeks. Put me in the hospital twice due to stomach issues and servere dehydration. Caused loss of hair, loss of appetitie,loss of libdo, extreme weight loss, depression, along with other flu-like symptoms. Has been two years and tests still come back negative. However have not been able to get back to normal since treatment still depressed, anxious, and still lack libdo",5
"48 weeks of treatments: Peg Interferon and Ribavirin. In treatment I felt tiredness, loss of appetite, dry mouth, vomiting after first injection, Loss of sex drive, skin rashes, depression and sleeping difficulties. Peg Interferon and Ribavirin. The treatment worked initially but my HCV returned after 6 months. The chances of the treatment working I was told was 50%. I now await to commence a new triple therapy that improve the success rate at 80% which see's me repeating Peg Interferon and Ribavirin initially and adding two other drugs ",1

Developed psoriasis, arthritis all over jumping around from joint to joint and settling in a number, balance problems, vascular problems in feet, fried thyroid, autoimmune hepatitis, depression, brain fog, loss of identity of self, tremors in fingers.  Liver damage increased rapidly and significantly during treatment.  Horrible medication.  Evil.  Worst side effects come on in few months after you quit taking drug, after you quit seeing your hematologist or gastroenterologist.   Hep C never bothered me.  Treatment causes pain, discomfort, loss of income and disability every day of my life.  It's absolutely crazy.  Most doctors are ignorant or in denial about severity of side effects (or really, injuries).  Be very very wary of this drug.  It can utterly ruin for life.  ",1
"I had Stage 3 melanoma.  I completed the 48 week treatments w/4 weeks of IV treatment (20 treatments) and 44 weeks of injections 3x's week.  First two days were ok...then wham!  Attitude is important as fatigue was alarming...it wasn't 'I need a nap' but rather ""You are taking a nap now.""  My blood levels (white count) dropped bigtime however, 10 days after ending treatments ended my white count more than doubled.  ",4

"I took this medication for the first time yesterday & am still waiting for the horrendous side effects!  I'm doing great!  I think alot of the way medicines work on people has alot to do with attitude.  I expected the worst, but prayed for healing, guess whats winning?  25 years of geno type 1b hep c I'm ready for treatment, Iv'e already been down in the slumps so to speak without treatment.  One day of treatment & I feel better than Iv'e felt for over 2 years!",5

"After 6 weeks of high dose infusion I started self maintnance 3x per week for the rest of the year.  This was the second time I had melanoma, stage III.  In the last 7 years since treatment I have had 2 more smaller melanomas that were caught early.    Side effects were at times unbarable.  But, I am still alive.  After having major flu like symptoms; high fever, weakness, mussel loss, weight loss, nausa, irratability, exhaustion, I do not complain anymore about getting a cold or flu!  It was 6-8 months to get the matelic taste out of my mouth and 2 years to feel normal again an have enough energy to return to my active life.",5
"I took this drug in 1993-94 for 6 months, shots in my legs/thighs 3 times weekly. It put the Hep C in remission, but 2 months after ending treatment I had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and had to go through 6 months of Chemo and a Stem-Cell collection proceduce which cured the lymphoma. I haven't been the same since! I was never sick before the Hep C, but since I've had 3 Heart Attacks, a Kidney Turmor, Restless Leg Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, RSD after a knee operation and I have CONSTANT PAIN in my legs, especially where I give myself the shots and I'm CONSTANTLY TIRED and have to sleep every few hours, these conditions have gotten worst slowly over time. I still think that INTERFERON caused MOST of this and cost me a VERY high-paying job and SCREWED UP my LIFE!!!",5

"My Geno Type is #1; the first month I showed a huge drop in the viral count; by the second month minimal drops & the onset of side effects of the mood swings, aggression, fatigue, hair loss, general pain all over has taken an extreme toll on my body.  During 1 of the high aggression episodes I called my supervisor a bitch & that I hated her.  This is NOT my normal personality. I almost lost my job, had it not been for letters from the doctor & the fact that I do an excellent job.  Even though my employer knew I was on this treatment, I am being blamed for ""willfully"" being insubordinate.

"I began my treatment with a daily infusion of Interferon for one month.  This was somewhat difficult for me.  I didn't feel like eating and I also seemed a bit agitated.  Then my treatment was reduced to three shots a week for one year.  I felt a little more tired and headachy but just tried to get more rest.  My hair did begin thinning out a couple months after treatment, however I did not lose it completely.  It has just been five years for me of being cancer-free.  Maybe I was one of the fortunate ones because Interferon was vital to me making it through Stage 3 of malignant melanoma.",5

My husband is taking this meds; it has been really hard on him and our family-he is unable to do anything- having extremely bad dizzy spells; weakness; and mood swings.  stays very depressed; unable to enjoy family outings. this is his second time around and this time is worse;  circulation 10Xs worse; so please before taking this get all information and please tell the doctor all your medical history on family and how you feel.,3
"from the onset of taking the injections and the oral tablets I began to grow depressede and fatigued.  My physician said these side effects are expected and will clear afteer the six month program.  Three years now I have been on every anti-depressant known.  I suffer chronic fatigue and what they are now calling Fibromyalgia.  I contracted the virus when I had a blood transfusion in 1968, presumably, as I have never done drugs and remained faithful to my wife for 40 years-I am now 60.  I have found many others who suffer the dreadful side effects. I am happy for those who were fortunate enough to get thru the treatment without lasting side effects.  I have sought in vain most of the medical colleges to see if they are doing any studys on persons like myself.  If anyone knows of such a study please let me know.  Before treatment I felt good, jogged 2 miles every day, out going etc. now I can barely walk and I guess I could say life doesn't seem worth living anymore",5
i was treated for melanoma.  The first month was fairly difficult but afterwards I was able to continue to work with no side effects.  I have been cancer-free 5 1/2 years,5

Side efects were terrrible. just finished with tratments this week. All test ressults came back negitive. Stsrting to feel norrmal again.,5
I have had none of the disease show up in over 3 years but I think it has messed up my thyroid. I lost a lot of weight when i was on the medication and now I can not gain any back. Has anyone else had this problem?,5
"it has been 10 years and i am still free .it was hard at first but after a month it eased, i was tired alot but i still worked full time and played sports and coached .",5
very hard to stay on treatment.,2

severe fatigue; bone aches; dry/raw mouth; severe nausea; constipation;,5
"I took this product for 6 mths as was recomended for the type of hep-c that i have. Immediatly after the treatment I tested with no virus dectected, 4 mths later I am back at 2 mill. The emotional devistation of this treatment failing is immeasurable. I also have fears that this drug regiment is known to cause cancer and I cannot find enough information one way of the other to either support these fears or eliviate them! During the treatment my red blood count was dangerously low. To the point of feeling like I would have a heart attack just walking across a small room. My doctor relied too much on her assistant who was very young and inexperienced. If i had not been persistant I could easily have died.  If you are planning on doing this treatment make certain you have a doctor you can trust.",1
sicker,1
I have hep c geno type 1a 40% response rate to drug-I did 8 weeks of treat & viral load was almost undetctable but had to stop due to low blood count & weight-was off treatment 4 wks viral load started to rise fast went back on 4 wks load low again but stopped treatment to change dr's--I guess it is worth it but the side effects-no appetite weight loss-not being able to get out of bed & diahera are nasty & I am have to weight quanity of life against quality,4
This drug makes me very sick. If I get better it will be worth it.   ,4
"Difficult treatment!!!  Did 20 weeks last year (2007.)  Had to quit due to a staph infection.  Viral Load went to undetectable, but was above 10,000,000 in about 6 months.  Have now done 44 more weeks of tx and viral load is once again undetectable.  I have had just about every side effect possible.  Nasty treatment!!!

"Within six months of completing required use, which was one year, I have had a reoccurance.",1
"I've taken this drug along with Ribitol for Hep-C about 10yrs ago, my viral load is still barely detectable. There's a price you pay, the aggressive treatment beats the hell out of you, especially in the beginning but you get use to it. My sleep pattern has changed, I am an insomniac and have mental issues- if you plan to take this drug, build yourself up first, you'll need the strength, I took the aggressive course, which is why it probably worked for me.",5
I'd rather be DEAD Than Ever Take this drug again. It works for very few people and I was not one of then BEWARE.....,1
took for almost 1  year yes I had bad sideeffect almost all that are mentioned. Became very anemic had staff infection which lead to being in hospital. Over all almost killed me.  But at the end of the year am happy to say I am considered CURED. So yes everything I went threw was worth it.,5
depression along with loss of appetite.Loss of words doing conversations,2
"This treatment was one of the hardest things I had to go through.  I lost most of my hair.  I felt run-down most of the time while on it, but I feel like I did benefit from the treatment.",4
Once you get past the initial six months I stopped having the weight loss and I only experience the pain if I skip doses for any amount of time over a week. I take 10mu 5 times a week for 6 years.,5
Cured type 2. Virus eliminated in 11 weeks. YEE HA!,5
6 weeks on med so far no real complaints.  Hope it works :),4

A friend had to take it and lived 6-7 years after taking it. I now have it and am looking for a drug the drug that will most effective. I have not used any thing yet.  I only checked the stars because it said I had to.,1
My Cousin has Hepatitis C.  However he is much better now.  This medicine is working very well for him.,5
I have been taking this drug off and on for 7 years.  My dr. has tried these tx several times. It has never put this in remission. I don't know it may be because  I have genotype 1a.,2
I took it for a year. Don't have to take it any more.,5
"I was given this as a daily for acute Hep-C Mine was caught really early before it got chronic so it was suggested to try this once a day fvor 6 weeks.    I was worried about all the side effects. they sounds terrible. I havnt had neusea etc. the only things I have noticed is being tired, some depression ( noticed by others) and some agressiveness ( noticed by others. ) but hopefully it will work well and just want others to not worry as much about the side effects they are pretty scary. ",4
i now want to start my treatment,3
been using this for 4 to 5 years and haven't had a problem with it. very easy to use at home and side effects aren't so bad but some days/weeks can be very bad but overall excellent treatment!,5
no treatment at present time.,1
the pharmacy gave me this instead of Alpha 2b.  I injected for 2 weeks at which time my hair started falling out.,1
"It was the most humbling experience, and I hope I never have to do it again.",4
The tumors are still shrinking. Had to stop drug due to liver problems.,4
I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 5 months ago - in February 2016 - and following tests was put on Indian generic Iressa from bonhoa.com. I can only say that I feel fantastic with only minimal side effects: occasional mild rash on chest (1-2 days only) and a bit tired afternoons - I have a nap for an hour and then all is good. ,4
"My tumor that had been 11cms was now 8.5cms with the generic one from bonhoa.com, this was a pleasant surprise as I was told Iressa would not shrink it but just stop it from growing. I can accept it, but not the price. Thanks the online pharmacy give me new hope. Hope with the help of the Indian Iressa, I can survive for more days.",4
"I have been taking Iressa for 3mons now for non small cell lung cancer metastatic to bone. Got another CT scan back found another lesion in bone.  The drug made my skin very dry, itching scalps, acnes, mouth sores, cramps on legs.",1
I had cancer in the left lung and in the bronchial area too.  Had a pnumonectomy to remove the left lung Jan. 2004  Have been taking iressa every day since then. I feel it has kept the cancer contained.,5
While the drug is actually infused 4 and 1/2 hours there is the necessary approximate 1/2 hour infusion of an anti-nausea agent first.  Then there is the 1 to 2 hour maits for the blood draw results.  Somehow this neeeds to be streamlined.  Is the complete remissiontotal just 6 %.,3
best drug,5
The ixempra given to my mother is very dangerous and should not be taken as it was very toxic instead patient should go for light drugs amnd only take this chemo when no other option left.,1
"I have had 5 treatmts so far maybe 2 more. My tumor has decreased slightly 1/2 inch After treatment Im tired low white blood ct bald, but overall bad 1 week good 2 weeks til next tretmt. This is my second time going thru chemo and will b my last Im giving it to Jesus totally done with doctors making all the money & my doctor stinks...Good luck to all who r suffering God Bless",3
I received 8 treatments along with Cytoxin. The only side effect I had was joint pain at the end. My pathology report indicated that it had little affect on my tumor (pure mucinous carcinoma). I also gained 25 lbs.,1
"I have had 3 treatments so far and have been very sick after each one- even 3 weeks out still lots of nausea and cannot eat.  Have lost 25 lbs so far. Very fatigued, lots of bone pain, quality of life is not good at this point.  Don't know if I want to take it even if it is working....should have resulta of PET and MRI next week. Looking for anyone else who had had bad side effects and what they have done to minimize them.",4
"I was part of a research group, this drug replaced taxol. Diagnosed stage 11 A triple negative tumor. First part of treatment was tough. Ixempra was the second half of treatment, and had fewer side effects. Some tingling in the feet and had trouble sleeping for a couple of days after treatment. I welcomed the energy and no sick stomach. The infusion time is long, but so far clean of cancer for three months.",5
see comments above. I am still stable with breast cancer in the lungs. I have been on Ixempra for 14 months now. I have no side effects to complain about.I feel very lucky to be able to have this drug. Another Christmas celebration is a blessing. Don't ever give up. Think that you are the exception not the average. God Bless you on your journey. Ginny,5
see 1st comment above. After second ctscan I was stable. I will have a third ctscan after next treatment. I have had few side effects so far. I am having some skin bumps and dryness on one eyebrow area. Hair regrowth has started again about end of second series  of ixempra injections. ,4
I have rec'd 5 treatments so far. Ctscan after 4 treatments showed 15 to 18 % reduction in size of breast cancer tumors which have gone to the lungs. I will have another ctscan after the 6th treatment. I have had many other treatments before this. Herceptin was my only treatment every three weeks for five years  years. Original breast cancer 1997 recurring to the lungs in 2000. I have had continuous treatment since then. New drugs keep coming on line and help me for a while.  ,4
It sucks.,5
I am 74 yrs old and have polycythemia vera (PV) since I was 62. Was on Hydrea and phlobotomy every 3 mos. Was seriously very depressed and low energies. On the India package Jakavi from bonhoa.com since May-2018 and no more phlobotomy. Now taking Jakavi 20mg twice a day. My life is back and feels like not having PV. Cost is bearable because India price is only 1/3 of Uk.,5
"Polycythemia Vera. No more itching, all blood counts are normal again. 15 mg 2X day. Side effects:  tinnitus, occasional fatigue, no more hip medication needed.",5
"I was diagnosed with PV 10 months ago when I was 39 years old (that's right, 39 years old!).  It was confirmed right away that I have the JK2 mutation. Started treatment with Hydroxyurea, but it didn't help with the pain associated with the enlarged spleen and the blood count was not improving (still getting high values). My condition progressed to myelofibrosis and the doctor replaced Hydroxyurea with Jakafi. Started with 15mg once a day, then 20mg once a day, then 20mg twice a day to 15mg twice a day after getting normal blood counts. So far I've been taking Jakafi for about 8 months and my spleen reduced in size from 23cm to 20cm. It is still an enlarged spleen, but it doesn't hurt. The only side effect I have is weight gain. I have no other side effects. ",4
"I was diagnosed 8 months ago with Myelofibrosis.  I am 76 years old.  The Jakavi has reduced the size of my spleen but my problem is that my platelet count is very low and also my hemoglobin.  The Jakavi does not tackle this problem so I have transfusions every month.  Hopefully soon, they will have some kind of cure for this disease.  After my transfusions I do pretty well and I have tolerated the Jakavi very well.",4
"Jakafi gave me my life back.  Started taking it four years ago after a splenectomy when it was discovered I couldn't tolerate Hydroxyurea and I stopped the medication.  My platelets had soared to nearly 9 million.  I am on a high dose of 50 mgs per day.  I feel better than I have in many many years.  I am able to work and lead an active life.  At this point nearly all my blood counts are in the normal range.  My only side effects are bouts of shingles and weight gain, both are worth the feeling of health.",5
"I am a male, 45-54 years old.  I was diagnosed with PV back in 04.  This has now progressed to MF.  I also have the JAK2 mutation.  I have been taking Jakafi for several months now.  It has definitely controlled my spleen but has done nothing for the other symptoms.  My blood counts are also low...I believe too low.  I have asked my doctor about this and waiting to hear what he has to say.  Having said all of this, it does look like this drug is working for others so I don't knock that at all.  All I can say is that it really depends on the patient!!",3
"my husband was diagnosed with myelofibrosis in july after a stay in hospital for low hemoglobin he was anemic and had to have three blood transfusions.he was so weak he had lost 40 lbs because he felt full all the time.his spleen was swollen,doc prescribed jakafi for him.I see a world of difference in him since he started on this drug.he's only been on it for one week he is feeling much better.I hope it continues to work for him he is eating now and he has a little more energy and a lot less pain in his bones.but be warned this medicine is very expensive",5
"Diagnosed with Myelofibrosis after a visit to the ER room where it was noted that my blood counts (WC and PL)were very high.  I do have the Jak2 mutation.. My doctor started me out on Jakafi about Sept. of 13.  Experimented with the dosage, and have settled to 20mg tables taken twice daily.   Overall, very pleased with the drug.  I have noticed that I can... if not careful gain weight, so I watch what I eat and have been able to maintain a weight that is acceptable, I guess.  Still once in a while will have night sweats, no big deal.  I do feel like I am tired more often, but it is not that bad either so once again no big deal.  Dizziness, every once in a while I have a very slight feeling of being dizzy.  I have always been able to handle it by just slowing down and it passes very quickly.   Over all... I am very satisfied with the drug.  Read up on the condition, with out it I am not sure how long I could have stayed in this game.  I consider it a maintenance drug and will most likely be on it for the rest of my life.   ",5
"I am 63 yrs of age. I was diagnosed with CML in 1996 with a Jak 2 mutation. I was asymptotic for the first tens yrs although my blood counts were abnormal, I was prone to infections, I continued to work and live basically a normal life. Ten years ago  my platelet count was over 1 million and I started hydroxyurea 500mg, 3 a day. After 10 yrs taking hydrea, my feet & ankles began to swell. One yr ago Jakafi was approved. My feet and ankles returned to  normal with Jakafi. I am 5'8"" and weighing 155. I now weigh 175. My appetite has increased.  Everything I eat adds weight. My blood work is good. I do require more sleep than my husband. I feel fine. I really am unhappy about the weight gain. The Jakafi has been a miracle drug for me. I would be totally happy if this weight problem had not happened. My doctor says I have less cells to burn calories. Good luck to anyone reading this post looking for answers. I hope my words will be useful to someone. I have had no negative side effects from this medication--rash, constipation, headaches, insomnia, swollen feet& ankles, dizziness. I read someone experienced urinary tract infections from the Jakafi. I have not had the urinary tract infection problem.  I feel good & I am putting on weight.",5
I was diagnosed with myelofibrosis in July 1013. Jakavi has been great at reducing the size of my spleen but I still have all the other symptoms. ,4
within one week I began to regain strength and am now virtually back to normal,5
"I was diagnosed at the age of 43 which is a few years earlier than the majority of cases reported throughout the U.S. its a rare disease which has no cure. I do have the jak2 mutation also a genetic foundation for myelofibrosis. I started jakafi in march 2012 and my blood counts improved very good but still have fatigue,weakness,bone pain,night sweats, and dizziness and frequent headaches affiliated with the jakafi. recently suffered a heart problem waiting for answers on this issue. havent been able to work and because Iam not a drug addict or a convicted felon I have been dinied disability. Happy the jakafi is working on my bood counts but not so on the physical problems to get me to work again. good luck with your experiences while on jakafi.",5
"Before Jevtana: metastases throughout spine and hips and a PSA of 1800.    PSA reduction of about 66% after two infusions, 3 weeks apart - current PSA is 580.   Platelet levels are increasing without blood transfusions.  Expecting another 6 - 8 infusions until November 2011.

I was given 6 months after chemo and radiation . We debated about keytruda because of the reviews. My Dr. assured us it was our best option. I have been taking keytruda for eleven months and am now considered in remission. I write this because I want people to realize it is a blessing for some people. ,5
This drug kills people ???????? when is it going to stop ,1
"I experienced minor side effects such as a cough, shortness of breath andmild headaches but not extremely severe. I am now on my 4th treatment.  [email protected]",4
After 6 treatments the drug is not working it would have been better off staying on another line of chemo which is not painfully debilitating like a true de is it has destroyed my ability to walk and now I have severe muscle pain all over my body and I am bedridden I do not know if these effects will go away no one has the answer I would stay away from any type of immunotherapy chemotherapy obviously been better for me in the past as I feel and I can walk and I'm out of bed at least when I take chemotherapy stay away from it doesn't work,1
I can tell you I felt better before I took a truda keytruda has made my legs very weak I can no longer stand on my own it is made me very tired and the tumors are still growing in my lungs this does not work for anybody and that's the problem they can't just put people on it as a gamble because it can definitely ruin your life and I could make you have no quality of life because of the effects of it it's a gamble doctors are taking they don't truly know what it does for the people that it doesn't do anything for especially when it was just approved for cervical cancer they don't have any studies I haven't seen anything on the Internet or had my doctor tell me about anyone who has cervical cancer that has had success with keytruda so we are all Lab Rats right now until they figure out exactly if it really does work or not I would say stay away from it,1
Shame on these pharm companies who fool people with these false ads and play with people's lives at any cost. This drug causes serious heart issues and MUST be taken off the market. It is not effective even 1%. Shame on you and your doctors who encourage patients to take them.,1
This is a very expensive drug and dangerous. My companion (female) took one treatment and she was dead in less than a month after the drug was given to her.,1
"After second doss, my brother started to have an internal bleeding that never stopped until he died a week later. DO NOT use this drug, it pushes up your immune system to the level that it starts to attack all body and making a lot of damage to the Healthy non-cancer related cells. I hope they completely withdraw this drug from the market.",1
"I have Metastatic Melanoma in my lungs Stage IV I have had 27 treatments and I am stable as of now. I do not get sick from this drug, I have not lost any weight nor many of the other side effects that they tell you to watch for. My Thyroid acted up a bit, but that's all. I thank God for this drug every day.",5
The side effects were the worst. The treatment with this drug was stopped after the first dose.,1
"The only problem I find so far,are some side effects. Nothing I can't handle..",5
"No  bad side effects so far other than  weight gain, small rash, thyroid messed up.",5
"UCSF is running a fine clinical trial. The nursing staff is wonderful and the doctor is excellent. I am getting frequent UTIs, which isn't supposed to be a side effect. I have been in the trial for eight months with about 20% shrinkage of my tumors, which are thyroid cancer tumors that have metasticized to my lungs.",4
"The primary side effects for me have been tired feeling, headaches, stomach/adominal pain and eye redness.  All of these did not develop until after second treatment.",3

On it for 6 months --- Clinical Trial for High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.  Itch -- take Claritin daily / Tired --- Rest alot / Stomach Issues --- Deal with them / Diareah/Constipated --- Each day is different / Headache --- Constant.

MY WIFE TOOK THIS TABLES OVER SIX MONTHS. AT THAT TIME CANCER CONTROLLED. BUT AFTER SIX MONTHS MYLOMA RISED. ,3
My father took this medication for three days and experience severe itchiness on his head/scalp and heart palpatations.  He discontinued the med but within a week had developed a severe and painful full body rash that has continued for over a week.,1
3 capsules of 25 mg. caused congestive heart failure and my Mother died.,1
I am so tired.,5
very painfull many reactions ,3
My father took Lenvima and got Septic Shock. He passed away 9 days later. ,1
Have taken Lenvima for 29 months- increased blood pressure which has eased recently-reduction in tumor size by 50 % no progression at all. Diarrhea is the main side effect. Have always taken 14 mg dose daily.,5

Have mouth sores, thick tongue,loss of appetite, severe fatigue,no quality of life, hospitalised 3 times in 1 year,severe dehydration, high red blood cells,heamogloblin,high hemocrit, severe infection, bladder infections,stomach discomfort, nausea. Coconut water helps nausea and dehydration.",5
"I have been taking lenvatinib from bonhoa.com for almost two months. I had thyroid cancer about six years ago. So nice to be on the cheap generic drugs THAT WORKS! I feel so much better since switching to it. I hope more doctor's will understand that this is a viable, wonderful option for their patients",5
"I was diagnosed with Stage IV renal cel carcinoma in January 2017. After two unsuccessful IL-2 treatments, I started taking lenvatinib from bonhoa.com in May 2018. At first I had all of the written side-effects but after completely changing my diet, they diminish significantly. Fatigue and whitening of my skin being my only problems. My last CT's continue to show a all of my known tumors as principally stable. The drug works for me! ",5
This drug has been very effective for me.  Only side effect I have had is increased blood pressure.  Tumors so far either decreased in size or remained stable.  I was part of the clinical trials for this medication.  ,5
Is working but slow and the price is a lot.,4
"This drug seems to have some serious side effects but I wanted to share my experience. My cat has Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia and the vet prescribed her Leukeran after Cyclosporine didn't work. So far, we have been having good results with the Leukeran and prednisone to supress her immune system. She was losing weight so we put her on cyproheptadine. I am praying it keeps working and other owners who have had to deal with this awful diagnosis will know to give it a try! ",5
"Cold Agglutinin Disease diagnosed June 2010. First treatment was 4 rounds of Rituxan. Titer's were at 20,400 and even after taking Leukeran for months they remain the same.

"My 74 year old brother contracted CLL. The hemoatologist precribed Leukeran. After only 7 weeks my brothers white cell count went from 207,000 all the way down to 4,800. He was take off the pills. Now white count increasing slightly each week, but no where near what it was.  After 8 weeks off the pill the white cell count is only at 13,100.  We highly recommend that you ask your doctor about this drug if you contract CLL. ",5

"It destroyed my taste every thing tasted terrible, i found it hard to eat enough to take pills. It destroyed my ability to do anything and even my will to live.  I felt like I had the flu, my digestive track was messed up, my stomach hurt a little more with every dose and would throw up despite taking anti nausea pills. I think I'll live out my life without it as it only on average adds a month of life",2
Hair loss at end of round one. Require a wig n oy w. Easy to take with few other side effects. CEA continued to rise after first round. Had to have an extra 2 weeks after round one before beginning round 2 due to low WBC count.,3
Lonsurf decreased the quality of my life completely.  After three rounds it was found to be totally ineffective.,1
This med has been really hard on my digestive tract. I have severe bloating and gas. Severe abdominal pain. After first treatment my CEA went from 298 to 990. Starting my second round of treatment. Was told by my doctor that this may spike my count and then start to lower it. Sure hope so! ,1
I have been diagnosed with advanced endometriosis and have been on lupron for over two years. I have suffered severe depression and anxiety along with nightmares and hot flashes. I seriously suggest not taking this medication at all costs. I believe it is very lethal and dangerous.,1
Has caused my prostate to shrink but has also made me nuts.Brought back unpleasant memories from 50 years ago that I had completley forgotten about and I can't stop thnking about.I have crying spells that last for 15 or 20 minutes almost every day,4
"six month injection for prostate cancer. My reaction has not been good. Lots of bone pain, lower back pain, trouble breathing, enlarged heart, so tired I can hardly get out of bed.

"Prostate removed 2001; Gleason score 7. PSA zero until 2013, when it started to increase. Started quarterly Lupron injections mid-2013. Testosterone and PSA have been zero since then. Fatigue, awakening every 2-3 hrs. at night to urinate and hot flashes are difficult, but overall I consider myself lucky. Daily Vitamin E seems to help hot flashes. Libido and urinary retention were affected by my prostate removal, so are not new issues.",5
"has helped prostate cancer side effects terrible. hives are on going hives since may 30 very debilitating, had them all over body ears eyes mouth. can nonger take for my cancer",5
"I was on Lupron for 6 months 2 years ago. It was wonderful while I was on it, but my endometriosis and fibroid pain were back within 5 months of being off the Lupron. Now, not only do I contend with that pain, but severe joint pain and bone loss, too. All the exercise, diet and supplements have not protected me from what I am going through now.",3
"I am only 1 week into my first shot but so far I have gained 7lbs in a week. My feet are swelling and my ""cramps"" are worse. So far no good. ",1
"I was put on Lupron as an alternative to taking birth control pills.  I was on it for 6 months and was going to be switched to Depro, which after reading reviews,I have decided not to take.   My side effects have been hot flashes and changing to extremely cold, night hot sweats, insomnia, fatigue, some moodiness,and loss of ability to have orgasms regularly. I also realized that I did have bad breath which may be a side effect, I read it on someone else's review and thought of the correlation.  I was previously diagnosed with endometriosis but was later told that I didn't have it, but I did have abdominal pain which the Lupron helped.  Also, no cycle for 6 weeks, that was GREAT!  Other than the negative side effects, which I just tolerated, I think that if it is effective for you or will improve your condition, then take it, but not long.  I was told 4-6 months is the limit.  Now, I guess it's back to dealing with the fibroids and the symptoms that will occur from them.",4
I am taking this med due to endometriosis. My abdominal pain has decreased substantially. The side effects that I am having are no more than were warned prior to use. I am experiencing depression but honestly with the severe pain prior to treatment created depression as well. Fatigue and hot flashes which again were all issues prior to use as well. This drug is a phenomenal medication that has saved many of lives for those suffering with cancer. Yes it comes with side effects as all medications do. The great thing is that we are made aware of the possible side effects so that we and our families know what to watch for. The side effects may last months but are usually not long lasting compared to the on going pain and misery most suffer without treatment. I also want to point out that this course of treatment is an OPTION for an individual to choose after considering all options set forth infront of them. It is not forced it is merely an option that 8 out of 10 times is the best choice.  As for the osteo issues they have preventatives used along with the lupron to help counteract that side effect. We all have an individual choice you shouldn't be able to make it for me just as I can't make it for you. STOP blaming the drug it has ALWAYS had the possibility of the side effects as does aspirin. ,4
"4 1/2 yrs after da Vinci radical prostatectomy PSA started to rise from <0.01 to 0.5 to 0.9 (possible mis-read as it was 0.6 a day or two after the 3 month shot a month ago. Now after the first month it is down to <0.01 with another test in a month just prior to probably starting radiation. Injection was below and behind hip (side of buttock). Next day it felt like a bad bruise but no pain after 3 or 4 days. Only symptom seems to be occasional hot flashes but I am California and it has really hot for several weeks! Also prescribed, in parallel, daily tablet of 1x 50mg Bicalutamide.",5
"Libido is gone, am tired, joints ache,muscles hurt,hot flashes.",5
Day three (for IVF) and I've been having wild mood swings and depression--NOT me at all! I'm worried and am going to talk to my Dr about stopping it. Not worth it.,3
I have had right side pain Doctors said I have Endometrois really bad periods.started me on Lupron within 2 weeks bleeding stopped and pain went away.,4
"My doctor suggested Lupron therapy for 3 months to help treat my endometriosis, before doing IVF. I am going on my third month of Lupron injections and I feel great. My husband was extremely skeptical of the drug at first because he was reading everyone's reviews online. He thought taking the Lupron was not worth the side-effects. To be honest, the only side-effect I'm having are hot flashes and they're not bad at all. (It's also the middle of winter in northern Wisconsin, so it's actually nice to be hot sometimes!) I would suggest if you have concerns about the drug, to speak with your doctor. My doctor told me that there are other medications that can be prescribed if you have negative side-effects from Lupron. I definitely think it's worth taking.",5
"Lupron makes me weak to the point where I cannot walk more than 100 paces. I get out of breath doing the simplest household things. It's hard for me to stand for more than 20 minutes. When I accidentally miss the Lupron shot, I feel strong and can walk much further and do many simple chores without tiring. My attitude is improved; I am more optimistic and cheerful. I dislike the drug intensely but it keeps my PSA down to about 24. I seem to have no other choice. I want to stop it but if I do I know my bone mets will increase. I am trying to work out a schedule where I don't have to get the Elgard every 4 weeks. Perhaps every 6 weeks would work as well. I am extremely sensitive to meds and take much lower doses than prescribed of many other meds and they work as well. I will reduce the Elgard to every 5 weeks and then every 6 weeks and perhaps every 7 weeks if my PSA doesn't go much higher.",5
I've been taking the six month injections for three years now.  Same day of my diagnosis was first injection.  Hot sweats is only side-effect of any significance.  PSA has been <.01 since after seeds and external radiation.  I attribute the great PSA to Lupron. ,5
"Leuprolide Acetate injection,? 3 month shot of Lupron shut my body down for months. I almost died from it. I experienced over 25 serious side effect from it including Anaphylaxis shock, heart rate at 41 bpm, severe rib pain and more. It took a year of my life away and I still had the cyst on my ovary. I went to a gynecologist who studies natural medicine and I got rid of the cyst, I still have all my parts and I didn't almost die from it! My endometriosis is cleared up without surgery or drugs.",1
"I was presecribed this after having surgery to remove major endometriosis adhesions.  Did OK for first month shot but after 2nd injection, started having anxiety and developed depression.  My dr blew these side effects off as unrelated to the Lupron-had me thinking it was my imagination until I got online and reread the possible common side effects.  EVerything I was experiencing WAS listed.  I would caution anyone considering this treatment.  For me, the treatment was FAR worse than the actual condition!  Am not using any more and would not recommend!",3
Side Effects with headache and mood (depression).  Had some funky dreams too.  Overall did work so can't complain other than NOT liking needles.,5
"I cannot say that this drug has been effective because I am just in the beginning stages of my infertility treatment.  However, the only side effect I seem to be experiencing is fatigue and as of recently, heartburn.  I was very nervous about injecting a medication into myself, but I found it very simple to do and I was not sore from it either.  I have been happy with my experience overall.",4
"I am on day 3 of a 14 day cycle of lupron for an ivf cycle. so far I've noticed a bit more hair loss, and it burns a little with mild itchiness that goes away. I'm glad it's sub-q and not IM...it's not intolerable but wish there was a patch for it!",4
"I have almost run my complete course on this drug, i have had the night sweats, and hot flashes, megace took care of that, cancer is gone thanks to external Radiation. i have suffered 4 heart attacks, some heart damage, and arterio-sclerosis,Since starting the treatment possible connection? I do not know. since my Cancer was Very aggressive, very Advanced, Inoperable, I think it was a fair swap they give me 5-7 more years, before recurrence or metastisation ",4
"I am on the 3 month injection of Lupron and I'm doubtful that I will do another 3 month. The side effects for me is: vaginal itching, dryness, spotting, bad breath, weight loss/ loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, severe headache, palpitations, depression, sore throat, mild acne, groin pain, pain in shoulder, legs and lower back, eye puffiness, frequent urination,insomnia, HORRIBLE hot flashes, night sweats, mild fevers,tongue and lip quivering. I felt like at one point my G-spot was numbed during sex. I have moderate endometriosis and was never able to carry a baby to term in the past. I am 34 and single and was worried that I may never conceive. I would get ovarian cysts in my left ovary and severe period pain. I am beginning to think I made a big mistake. I am praying I feel better in June.",3
"I have experienced a lot of fatigue, a headache lasting a couple days, an upset stomach/diarrhea  in the evenings, and mildood swings.No symptoms that were major and nothing that made me want to stop taking the mediciation. It is part of my IVF cycle/treatment and I will only need to be on this medication for about 10-15 days. 3-4",4
"After not getting pregnant and stage 5 endo. I started lupron march 9th. Before my first shot. my cycle was very heavy and i had lots of clots. I was also so down and depressed. I was always upset and mad. Since my first shot, I have had no side effects. My cycle this month was not be heavy and have had just one little clot. Even on my heavy day no clots just the one at the end of my cycle. I am getting back to my old self. I was so worried with all the stuff I have read about side effects but so far my first month has been good. All the stuff I have read women said the first month was bad and some said so bad they stopped lupron. I don't feel this way and I'm so far pleased. I just hope that my endo does go away or away enough so I can finally get pregnant. I'll post again next month! I don't want ppl not to take it becasue what they have read, it scared me. I went ahead and tried lupron becasue it was my only hope. The doctor said a 3rd surgery would just scar me up more and lower my chances of getting pregnant. She said lupron would give me the best chance. I had nothing to lose. So Yeah! Im pleased so far and I hope I stay happy with it and pray I get pregnant.",4
"I have endometriosis, fibroids, and cysts on ovaries. I had first treatment with Lupron 2 years ago, to help with pain and prevent further growths after surgery. Then, I had no side effects at all, and was pain free after the 3rd shot of Lupron for 1 year. I was extremely happy with the results. Now I am on Lupron again, just took 3rd shot, and it did not help much with pain, and I have horrible side effects: weakness, fainting, cold sweats 24/7, nausea, vomiting, cannot eat anything, trouble urinating, short breath, and ocassionally shooting burning pain in one brest. I can barely go to work any more, I spend most time trembling cold and sweating at the same time in bed, and I am not taking taking any more Lupron ever.",4
"I have had sever hot flashes and night sweats as a result of my second injection.  I have also had some really up and down mood swings.  However, on a bright note I have had less pain with my endometriosis than before.  ",3
"I am permanently DISABLED because of Lupron. This hideous drug ruined by life, health and robbed me of my future! I have to suffer every day. Lupron is a nightmare injection that disabled tens of thousands of people, children, men and women. It is scientifically proven that Lupron is dangerous and ineffective. Lupron is made by Abbott/TAP who are convicted criminals, fraud with Lupron. Abbott manipulated their studies and bribed doctors to prescribe Lupron. Abbott, greedy evil bastards, manipulate our health care system.

Lupron apparently reduces my PSA Side effects; weight gain and growing breasts,3
"I took Lupron just ONCE for a fibroid and it utterly destroyed my abdominal wall, and thus my life.  I have not recovered even after major surgery.  I also had sharp shooting pains right away, and now have osteoporosis.  The drug didn't even shrink my fibroid!  Lupron is a dangerous drug that should be off the market!  ",1
"This will be my second 6 month round of treatment for endometriosis. I lost my right ovary about 1 1/2 years ago and had my last shot October 2010. The symptoms have now come back, but even worse. I really loved being on the Lupron, no menstural cycle for 6 months and the night sweats and hot flashes were not that bad. This has really worked well for me.",5
"Questionable effectiveness after 3 treatments (9 months) withexternal radiation PSA is rising again. Side effects (bone density loss, weight gain, various metobolistic anonomalies) i would not take it again",3
"Sweats, mood swing, lime salty taste in my mouth. Been going on for 6 months. I beleive it is form having this shot. ",1
"Injection taken 10/2/2010.On 12/1/2010 experienced sweating at 50 deg,f. Every 10 minutes I have ""hot flashes"". Radiologist sad it will cease8/2/2011. Internet search found no cessation. I am 67 and dont think it was necessary. The cancer seldom is fatal before 10 years and the risk of heart failure are too great. I am sure it was given to generate wealth for the clinic.",1
"Had 6months of once a month shot of lupron to shrink uterine fibroid. i experienced severe hot flashes, depressio, hair loss and darkening of my skin especially on my face.But the most important thing is that it shrunk my 22cm fibroid to 15cm and made the surgery safer and easier,i had a positive attitude though and i take all the side effects as mild changes that will go with time, and most importantly,i exercised regularly and was eatind lots of fruits, veggie and soy milk.",4
After a radical prostatectomy and my PSA increased somewhat. My Dr said there maybe some stray cancer cells present. I took the 3 month injection 09/01/09 and my life has been pure misery since. Went back to Dr and he advised me my PSA was >0.01 so would not need another injection. Told him would never take again my body and mind might not survive. I have been a paraplegic for 25 years and this med robbed me of most of my muscle strength. The bone pain in areas where I had no sensation is getting unbearable. The pain has caused many changes in mood and interaction with friends and family. I have also lost motivation for basic everyday task.,3
"This drug has caused my dear friend to have osteopenia and thyroid disorders as well as permanent disability and continual pain.  All of this is medically verified by M.D. doctors. I personally have spoken with a woman who is only 35 years old, who now walks with a cane, after Lupron.  Prior to Lupron she was active and healthy other than endometrisis.  This drug is pure poison check out Youtube see a ABC News Story from Las Vegas.  Further, it is category X for pregnancy and can harm the fetus.  Why are they giving it for IVF?  There are over 12,000 MedWatch reports about this hideous drug at FDA.  There are far more risks than benefits.  It has a 0% cure rate for Endometriosis and a 98% adverse event rate and it is ONLY a temporary pain reliever that shuts down your entire endocrine systems.  Run away from your doctor if he suggests this nightmare.  This drug destroys the human body!!!",1
"Prescribed this drug due to acute endometriosis. Had hot flashes, night sweats, and weigh gain. Also, haven't had the pain. Highly satisfied with this treatment.",4
I did not have severe side effects .,2
On day 9 of taking it as a gestational carrier. No pain with injection and no noticeable side effects other than a headache today but who's to say if that's from the meds or something else? ,3

"Some burning & bruising at injection sites. Not too bad in the side effects department, but I've had some headaches and am tired, but can't sleep well. Is all worth it if this helps me get the results I want tho!  ",4
"Wow, this stuff is dangerous ""Overpriced Poison"" see ABC News Channel 13 story in Las Vegas.  This drug was originally approved in 1985 for Advanced Prostate Cancer.  Lupron has over 12,000 adverse events reported to FDA.  Why would anyone take this drug? See lupronvictimshub.com. before you are conned into taking and weight the risks (serious) and benefits (if any?)  Beware of this drug!!",1
"Lupron caused severe depression, fatigue, joint pain and very disrupted sleep and my father committed suicide after three injections that a nurse practioner gave him for prostate cancer.  This drug us poison.  There is a petition against this drug with Congress. He also had a bad heart and lupron causes cardiac arrest so the nurse never should have given him this drug.  This drug has many complaints against it from patients, researchers, etc.  Don't take this drug at all. ",1
"I WAS TAKING LUPRON TO SUPPRESS MY CYCLE BECAUSE I WAS DONATING MY EGGS TO MY SISIER, THIS DRUG MADE ME VERY IRRITABLE, MORNING SWEATS, AND TERRIBLE HEADACHES. I HAD TO STOP AND GO ON GANARELX",3
"on day 3 of shots for IVF cycle. I have an upset stomach, a little headache, and feel super fatigued. was able to go to gym this am, but will be taking it lighter now that I see how this med makes me feel. ",5
I go from hot sweats to extremely cold in a very few minutes No other side effects. I took the 6 month shot and have been on it 3 months.,5
"Currently on my second week of taking the drug as part of an IVF cycle. Up to now, the only side effects I have experienced are night sweats and a few moderate headaches but nothing more than that. ",4
As part of IVF and it has worked with minor side effects of headache and slight depression.,5
"I took my second Lupron shot today and the only side effects I have had to deal with thus far are the headaches and the burning when injecting.  Other than that, the nightmare side effects I read about when I was first told of this option have not happened, but even if they had, if it makes it where my hubby and I can get preggers.. It's would be worth it.  TTC for 2 years",5
"This is part of my protocol for an IVF cycle for frozen embryo transfer.  Directly before using this I have been on a estrogen based birth control, which is standard practice.  Starting on 10 units of Lupron and possibly reducing to 5 units in a week and a half I have noticed some cramping feelings.  I have been told that this is to assist to increase my endometrial lining for the transfer.  I also feel not that I have gained weight, but there has been swelling in my stomach area, more of a symptom than a reaction to the shots.  All injections are given in alternating sides of my lower stomach inches away from my belly button.  Approximate duration for shots is about 3 weeks.",5
"I have experienced a lot of tiredness, mild night sweats, a couple days of depression here and there, a headache lasting a couple days, an upset stomach in the evenings, weight gain and acne.  No symptoms that were major and nothing that made me want to stop taking the mediciation.  It is part of my IVF cycle/treatment and I will only need to be on this medication for about 3-4 weeks.",5
"I have experienced some hot flashes, mild chest pain along with slight depression. Overall had no major side affects.",4
"This medication is being used to reduce my hormone level as a way to control my migraine headaches.  I have had them everyday for seven years.  I have tried everything; AMA modalities and otherwise.  This is medication has worked wonderfully for me when combined, during the forth month, with 10 mg. of calcium channel blocker.  I have had two months with out a headache.  It is incredible to be alive again.  ",4
I have lost all of the hair under my arms and on my arms and legs Is this a chemo therapy drug?,4
"Minor side effects.  Hot flashes, not sure if other menopausal rxns just maybe the way I am.  Had a brief headache once, but overall the experience has be good.",4
THIS MEDICATION HAS WORKED FOR ME . I HAVE BEEN SATISFIED NOT SIDE EFFECTS.,5
"Hot flashes, minor mood swings (PMS like), trouble sleeping.  ",5
"I have been on this shot for about 3 years now, and it's been a God sent for me. I had been having extremely heavy periods (one of which lasted 9 months), some months I would have more then one. The pain was unbearable. I missed a lot of work due to periods. I sometimes get night sweats now, but I can deal with that. ",5
This drug should be taken off the market. It does not cure or treat Endometriosis. It almost killed me.  I know have life long side effects. Awful POISEN,1
"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995, with radical prostatectomy the same year. A return of high PSA in 2014.  A body scan in 2014 showed malignant neoplasm of prostate in the pelvic area. My Oncology/Urology MD started me on LUPRON DEPOT 90-day injections in 2015.  The first PSA test in 2015 showed NO reading. The no reading has continued to date. The only side effects to appear was a large number of ""hot flashes"", which continue. ",4
"I took this 8 years ago for endo and while my endo pain is better, my health in almost every aspect is not. I was perfectly healthy aside from the endo. Was a runner, very busy, energetic, etc. I was only 25 when I took it and 1 year later I started having lots muscle aches and joint pain. I was always tired, gained 20 lbs... My dr thought I had fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed with chronic compartment syndrome and thus had leg surgery in my right shin to relive the fascia. It took another year or so to find out I now have arthritis in my knee and spine and I also have Lupus. No one in my family has lupus. I get migraines a few times a month. I can't do nearly as much as I used to and if I try I can barely move the next day. I'm only 33 and my body feels and acts like its 60 . If I could go back in time and NOT take this poison, I would. In a heartbeat. I have no doubt that taking this ""medicine"" has made me worse off than before. Please research this drug and the company before taking the shot. They have lied and hidden the facts about this drug. It should not be on the market. ",3
Praying they eventually remove this drug from the market. I have terrible joint pain two years after completing therapy. Changes on MRI showing subarachnoid cystine a partial empty sella ( which was not present on a baseline MRI years ago) in conjunction with a different kind of worse migraine than I ve ever experienced.,1
"This drug should be taken off the market. IT is like putting posion into your body. It has been a year since I took my last shot and I am still suffering from the side effects of the shot. I finally had a GI dr that would agree with me that this med is terrible. He said he would only use it on cancer patients. I still suffer from VERY BAD anxiety and panic. I am always thinking something is wrong with me. I have to take a sleeping pill every night just to sleep. I have avoided getting on any anxiety meds, but I am about at my end. I am only 38 and have been rung through the mills with test. I also suffer from high blood pressure now. I NEVER had any of these symptoms until that shot. If you do not have to, do NOT take this shot. It is not worth it at all.",2
"Have Endo in my bowel post hysterectomy. Was given this poison to see if my one ovary was affecting the endo. As a result of the shots I have had Hyper ventilation syndrome, anxiety attacks with de ja vu for the last two years after  just three shots!  ",1
" I have stage 4 Endo. I have had problems with ovarian cysts for over a year. My doctor finally did laparoscopic surgery and removed a ""chocolate"" cyst that was inside one of my ovaries. After the surgery my doctor highly recommended lupron. I was hesitant to take the shot, but I was willing to do whatever to help with the pain and to help get  pregnant. I am in my third month of the shot and it hasn't been too bad. I have night sweats, hot flashes, mood swings, occasional bleeding, and I forget a lot of things, BUT I am not in pain and the other symptoms are not constant. All in all I feel the same as I always have. I would be willing to take this shot for however long my doctor recommended if it meant that it would help my chances of getting pregnant.",4
"Bad mood swings, forgot every little thing, did not feel any better.",1
I was in the worst pain in my life. And I still believe it is the cause of the problems that I have continue to have. All relating to the Lupron. I would not use again for any reason.,1
"Uterine Fibroids 27 years ago, poly cystic overaries, adenomyosis, you name it. I have had extreme pelvic pain and wanted a total Hysterectomy. My doctor recommended Lupon Depot 11.25 injections (3 months. I have been on this medication since 2006 and had no pains, no periods, etc. Now the insurance company says I cannot get it anymore since the FDA changed the regs. Its been 2 weeks and the pain is starting to come back: back pain, heaviness in the pelvic region.  I am not a happy 51 year old",5
"I have a fibroid larger than a softball and am due to have a partial hysterectomy later this year, but my symptoms are unbearable.  I discussed Lupron with my doctor and he said I'd be a good fit.  I read all about the side effects, and like a good practitioner, my doctor told me that I could get all or none of the side effects, or anywhere in between, that it's a gamble and that I was responsible for understanding that there is risk in everything.  I told him I can't live with the symptoms anymore and he agreed to Lupron.  The day I got my first shot my symptoms began disappearing one by one.  No more debilitating cramping, headaches, back aches, mood swings.  I feel like a normal person again.  I can't remember the last time I felt this great.  That's not to say everything is awesome.  I do get dizzy spells and hot flashes, and my bloating is SLOWLY decreasing but it's getting there, but the trade-off is SSOOO worth it.  My relationship with my boyfriend has drastically improved because my mood has improved.  I don't get down on myself anymore and my general outlook on life is brighter.  I think that has a lot to do with the symptoms being mitigated.   Finally a doctor who listened to me and attacked the issue and not JUST the symptoms.  I am grateful to my doctor for prescribing this medication, but also for preparing me for the side effects that I may experience.   No doctor in their right mind should tell you definitively that you'll ONLY have this side effect or that side effect.  That's just bad form.  And if you do have a doctor that does that, find a new doctor.   Do the research.  Understand what you're getting yourself in to.  Ask questions.  This is your health. Do what's right for you",5
"I had stage 4 Endo and had a mass removed from my colon that turned out to be Endo. I took 4 of the 6 shots and said I cant do it anymore. Please be aware of ALL side effects. I was told I would only get hot flashes. That is a LIE! Lupron is like putting posion in your body. I suffered from hot flashes, anxiety, panic attacks, high blood pressure (150/107), muscle aches, vomiting, blurred vision, dizziness, stomach pains, vaginal discharge, and more. I am only 37 and have never had any health issues or been on any meds except birth control until now. I would NEVER recommend this drug. I wish I would have just had a total hysterectomy. Please consider all options before taking this poision. ",2
"Like the other women in my family, I had uterine fibroids.  The one inside my uterus was 4cm and was causing heavy bleeding and cramping during my periods.  Because I also have a history of uterine cancer in my family, I really just wanted a hysterectomy.  Doctors want you to try everything under the sun before they'll give you a hysterectomy.  My doctor told me about the side effects like hot flashes and night sweats (neither of which I actually got). It didn't affect my libido either but I did start getting migraines again and I've been very moody.  She said I might have one more period before they stopped altogether but that it would be ""light.""   She didn't tell me anything about what actually happened.  I got my first shot of Lupron and two weeks later I had the worst period of my life.  I was hemorrhaging blood for 24 hours.  After that, the blood flow slowed down, but 7 days later I'm still bleeding with no end in sight.  The Dr. office told me there is nothing they can do to stop the bleeding but that I should get the 2nd shot as planned!  I told them that's not going to happen and that I would find another doctor. I don't know how the doctor could have been so completely wrong about how this drug would affect me, but I don't trust her anymore.  I will be looking into getting a hysterectomy.  I'm done trying alternative remedies.",1
"I will never recommend lupron depot to my worst enemy. I have not been the same since I got my first shot. I am not planning on getting the second one. My anxieties has turned into panic attacks and my depression got so bad that now I have to be on antidepressants. I have not had a good night sleep since I got the shot and my pains are worse. it is going to be 1 month since I got it. I cannot wait till it is completely out of my system, so I can have a life again. i prefer to live with the endometriosis than try anything that will cause menopause.",1
"I have endo, fibroids, and ovarian cysts.  First time I took it (monthly injection for 6 months), was symptom free for five years.  Hoping for great results again this time (3-month dose taken twice).  Get some hot flashes and night sweats but a small price to pay for the pain relief.",5
"I'm 35 years old and suffered from chronic pain on my right side that would radiate to my back. After about 5 pelvic ultra sounds I had one bad episode that sent me to the ER where they found that I had a cyst the size of a grapefruit on one of my ovaries. I had surgery to have it removed and once the doctor opened me up he said it was a mess inside. My inside was filled with a bunch of blood. Once I had the ovary and all the blood removed I started to feel pain on the other ovary, but within a month I started Lupron and my life changed! Since I've been on it I haven't had any pain. The down side to it is that I do get the night sweats, and hot flashes. The worst side effect is the loss of sex drive. I went from having a very active sex life to not wanting to have sex at all. Luckily, my boyfriend has been very understanding. I just got my second (last) shot last week and I'm nervous that the pain will come back. I'm confident my new doctor is doing all he can to treat me because I couldn't imagine where I'd be if I was still seeing my same OBGYN. ",5
"I have been dealing with increasing pain and bleeding during menstrual cycles for the last 6 years.  I thought that it was a normal process of getting older (my mother had similar issues).  After developing a mass in my groin I decided to seek advice from a doctor.  They told me that I had a hernia and that it was not a concern for treatment at this time.  I sought advice again when I started bleeding from my bowels on a monthly basis with excruciating pain.  It has taken over three years (from the first time I sought advice) to finally get a diagnosis of Endometriosis. Even as I went in for surgery, my surgeon was not convinced that I had endometriosis and he thought I had a hernia causing all of my symptoms.  After surgery, they said that I was in advanced stages of Endometriosis.  I have already started Lupron (1st shot in July) and it has been a blessing. Yes that hot flashes, night sweats, uncontrollable emotions, and irritability are overwhelming; but I not have a control over the pain and bleeding.  The best advice I have is to listen to your body.  You know it better than anyone else and if you are concerned about something then seek advice and don't give up until you are comfortable with the diagnosis.  It may take 6+ years and 20+ different doctors; but your health is worth it.",5
"The side effects are horrible, but hopefully it was all worth it!! The hot flashes/night sweats are constant, and I'm very grouchy. Nothing fun about this drug what so ever. We shall see soon how well it worked.",4
"Since end of last yr/early of this yr,  my periods became extremely heavy flow during the first 3/4 days...went to see Dr. she ordered an ultrasound, found out I have 2 fibroids...one is about 5cm & the other about 4cm. While waiting to see gyno, my family dr. gave me a prescription ""Cyklokapron"" to help with the bleeding. But it actually made it worst for me...the bleeding was non stop for months. I went into emergency twice - both Dr. told me that the prescription is not strong enough so I need to increase the dose. I didn't increased it as I was getting other side effects from this drug.   My pain was getting more intense & hemoglobin was very low so my family Dr. told me to go to hospital to get blood transfusion. Had to request an emergency to see the Gyno...finally got in to see her, she too told me that I need to double my dose. So I listened to her but it got worse! She told me to take Lupron to help stop the bleeding & reduce the size of fibroids before the surgery.  The first 2 wks of the injection of Lupron, the side effects were mild but by the 3rd wk, I woke up to a terrible headache, dizzy & nauseous. The hot flushes got more frequent & intense too.  The bleeding only stop during the 4th wk of my first injection.   I'm now on the second injection, however, the side effects like everyone here mentioned are the same-terrible! Hot flushes, rapid heart beat, sometimes I feel shortness of breath, fatigue and I also noticed that my breasts has also shrink as it mentioned ""breast changes"", on & off cramps, back aches, etc. Told the Gyno about my symptoms, she said it's related to my anemic as my hemoglobin was at 82. My gyno. said I need to top up my hemoglobin before the surgery  (the earliest scheduled is in Oct.). So I tried the i.v iron injection but had allergic reaction so now I'm taking Feramax iron pills twice a day and calcium 2x a day. I do not want to take the next injection as the side effects are terrible & it's seriously wearing me down!",3
"My endo symptoms really got bad after my daughter was born (C-Section). Very heavy blood flow for days, to the point where I was changing super plus tampons every 45 minutes and clots larger than golf balls. The pain? Excruciating! Ive wanted a hysterectomy for years but every doctor I saw told me they wouldnt do it because I was too young. (I was 20 when my daughter was born) The OBGYN I see now, prescribed Lupron for me every 3 months for 1 year. I just had my 3rd shot in April....NO PAIN AT ALL. Its wonderful. Yes, there are side effects, hot flashes are really annoying, sweating all the time, and zero libido. To me, these side effects are completely worth it. I no longer have to feel like my bladder and other organs are 'bouncing' with each step I take.  The fact that I have a very compassionate husband helps too. ",5
"My OB-GYN recommended this treatment for diagnosing whether I had endometriosis. He told me that it would help if I did or it would make my symptoms worse if i didn't. I had very few side effects, and it helped immensely! I had the treatments for 6 months. My last shot was in February and I haven't had any problems since. The only thing is that it has been almost 4 months since my last shot, and I still haven't had my period. I don't really mind except me and my husband are trying to get pregnant. At least we are getting plenty of practice in ;)",5
"I had this injection 3 monthes ago , i was scared by reading some of the rievews. however after i took the shot, i was really satisfied with the result, the only sideeffect i experinced was hot flashes, no joint pain or gaining  weight.",5
"I have taken two shots so far. After the first shot I begin to have hot flashes, night sweats and upset stomach. I did still have severe cramps still but no bleeding . By the second shot I had all the above symptoms along with severe joint pain to the point of going to a physical medicine doctor and having to get a MRI that stated that I had a meniscus tear in my knee and arthritis which has caused me to be off work for almost two weeks already. I was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and may possibly need surgery. I believe the medication cause weakness in my joints making it easier for injury. I have already paid for the third shot and it has been delivered to the doctor but I am going to refuse to take it. I will just move forward with getting the ablation surgery after my knee issues are taken care of. I'm also experiencing anxiety really bad along with not being able to sleep. So no telling what the third shot might bring on. So for me even though it helped the side effects were worst then the benefits. ",3
"I have pretty severe endometriosis to the point where the endo was into my bladder and causing me to have to go to the bathroom 11+ times a day, sometimes not making it. I'm only 32 so this was totally unacceptable. Started out as bladder infections about 5 years ago, turned into bladder pain, birth control kind of helped but my blood pressure would go through the roof and on my period weeks I would suffer. The endo causing the issue was 3 inches, after 5 months its now 3 cm!!! Noticeable difference. I go in to remove the rest of it tomorrow. This saved me from months on a catheter!!!! I only had two noticeable hot flashes. I'm not going to candy coat it, I was in the hospital the first month for what I thought was a stomach virus. Second month I had something similar but it was only one month later to the day. You may want to ask your doctor about anti nausea meds for just the first two months and seriously, its only a just in case. I've had 5 years with this endo/bladder issue and I'm finally going to be getting rid of it. Lupron definitely helps. I did get the add back but I would only use it when I noticed memory issues, aches, or flashing. I don't know if it was how I took it but I had one shot per month. Maybe the monthly dosage was easier on my body. Reading reviews like this scared me into not taking it for the first few years, now I'm mad at myself for not doing it earlier. My hair was even starting to drop out because the endo was messing up my hormone levels. Also, highly recommend taking this during the winter. My body temp always felt warmer.",5
"When started PSA 7.0.  Treatment Lower my PSA to 0.3 in the  first year of use.  My sex drive went to zero and hot flashes most days.  Have joint pain and lower back pain in a.m. When first get out of bed, but usually goes away after out of bed for a few hours.",3
"My GyneOB recommended I take these shots for 6 months following my surgery to remove a HUGE fibroid as well as a cyst on each ovary.  During surgery, she discovered that I also had a severe case of endometriosis.  She said that the Lupron Depot would help get rid of the endometriosis.  Each month I took a shot in a hip (alternating each month).  I researched all the possible side effects but still was not prepared for them!  The ones that chose me were the lovely hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain, decreased(basically extinct) libido and vaginal dryness.  My Dr. suggested that I only take 6 treatments, then take a break, which I did but the side effects lasted at least another 4-6 months!  I can't see where the shots even helped! I had to have a laproscopic surgery last year for another cyst removal and the endometriosis was worse than before!  I had so much scar tissue that I now have one completely block fallopian tube and one partially blocked.  So now, my husband and I are on mission impossible trying to get pregnant (for more than a year now).  I also have horrible joint pain still especially in my hips where the treatments were administered.  Be very careful, Ladies.  I do not recommend this drug.  If you absolutely have to take something to treat your issue (like I did), do your research...but also mentally prepare yourself for the life-altering side effects!  Or maybe you'll be blessed like some of the other reviewers and have minimal or no side effects at all.  :-)  Good luck and be blessed.",1
Run!!!!  Do not take this drug.  It will ruin your life.  Still having side effects a year later and it made my problem 100000x worse.  It should never be given to a patient.  DO NOT TAKE.,1
"I LOVE Lupron.  I have had endo for 4+ years and 2 of which went undetected and with horrible pain.  I have been on Lupron for 18 months and about to start my next 6 month session. I do experience some of the ""menopause symptoms"" but I'll take it compared to the horrible pains that I had with Endo.  I've had two bone scans to ensure my bones haven't been weakening and so far do good! Since its only recommended to be on it no more than 2 years, I'm entering my last 6 months and this saddens me... I love how convenient it is and most importantly how well it works! ",5
I had the worst experience with this Drug. Every side effect plus I broke-out on my back and it didn't work.  I ended up having a myomectomy anyways.  It was a total waste of time and Abbott Endocrinology screwed up the billing on several occassions.  ,1
"Prescribed series of 3 shots for treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids before scheduled hystorectomy.  Stopped menstrual cycle and cramps which was great.  However, severely compromised my mental stability. After second shot I developed extreme anxiety/panic attacks, unable to eat or sleep, hot flashes/flushes, electric shock/fluttering feeling in my heart and acne.  Declined 3rd shot and still trying to get myself back in balance before my surgery.  Research to make the best informed decision!!!!!!!!  ",3
"Since being on the injections I have been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Deprivation and Memory problems, depression and weight gain. ",3
"The first time I I went on Lupron , I had stage 5 ,  the first 4 to 6 months were ruff , lots of hot flashes night sweats , dry mouth, but as time went by it got better , the pain got so much better, I went from pain on a scale of 1-10 usually a 8 to 0 after about 9 months , yes there is lot of uncomfortablity, to this shot , I went off after 1 year , symptoms free , but 2yrs later the emdometrosis is back , I started the shot gained a month ago , going to have my 2shot tomarrow , you have to weight the pros and the cons, it's not right for everyone , I don't want to take it but I also don't want a hysterectomy, there is no real cure for this disease , I've been living with it for 30 something yrs, it's been just getting worse as I age, good luck to all woman , who need too take it ,I font want to but I need relief , that melds don't give you.",5
"I had Lupron Depot 3 Month 11.25 mg.  I was told that the first two weeks were supposed to be horrible, but for my surprise I felt better.  On the third week some of the bad symptoms started, hot flashes, headaches, cramps that don't go away, joint pain, I feel weak.  I don't have any depression, mood changes, and or night sweeting.  I have notice a reduction on my stomach which means my fibroids might have gotten smaller.  I would recommend this medication if you are having surgery afterwards, but be prepare for the pain.  I don't know how satisfied I am yet since this is my third week and the medication is supposed to last 3 months.  I will come back and write about my experience in 3 more months.",3
"I have received one of these shots to try and assist with my endo and uterine fibroids. The doc that issued this drug to me did not inform me of any of the horrible side effects it causes. I am 24 years old and feel like I'm going through Menopause! Electric tingly sensations, hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, mood swings, dizziness, nausea... need I go on? This drug has made me worse off than I was previously. Unless surgery for you is completely not an option I WOULDN'T get this shot. It sucks.",3
"This medication helped me stop having cycles, which is exactly what I needed. My cycle was SO HEAVY I had to have iron transfusions all the time. I have thus far  had no serious or unbearable side effect. I have fibroid on top of having to take Coumadin for factor 8 diagnosis. Surgery was not a favorable option, so for me this a God send, and I pray that it continues to work until I reach menopause an And have no long term effects from it's use. ",5
"Used during invitro and also endometriosis. Horrible fought it each time, but dr. seemed confident, and then basically told me if I wanted to do invitro had to use it as chemical menopause.  It worked for that within a week, but the long term effects are not worth it.  Headaches, brain lesions, numbness in limbs,etc...I do not know how it works in men as that what it was designed for (FDA at the time, they told me not for women) but do not advise for women.  Too harsh.",1
I was just given the injection about  2 weeks ago for 1 month.I have severe headaches that just come and constant joint pain and chest pain.I cry all the time my emotions are over the top.I have never been this way and am scared because I need to take this for 3 more months.Still in pain about to have MRI in another month to see if It is working will let you know. My memory is still intact and I constantly read and study to keep my mind going.,2
"I wish I had never gotten this shot and will never do it again. I was told very little about it and rushed into the decision in my preop appointment less than 24 hours before surgey.   I had it during a diagnostic laparoscopy so its ease of use gets 5 stars since i didnt have to do it nor feel it. Its effectiveness should get zero stars. I was told I would not ovulate and therefore not menstruate. I have been bleeding heavily for over a week and no one can tell me if or when it will stop, nor did they ever tell me it would start in the first place.  Satisfaction should also get zero stars. Not only is it NOT helping with my pelvic pain or heavy menstrual cycle, I have become a useless blubbering idiot. I have since learner that by shutting down all of the estrogen in my body I also lose complete control of any emotions. No one told me that would happen either. I am so depressed my mind is going crazy and now I need more meds they say....  Don't let time or other people push you into making this decision. I wish I didn't. I never would have done it.",1
"First of all, I am a male that has had prostate cancer. I am experiencing hot flashes and severe bloating of the stomach. A little problem with sleeping, but over all doing fairly well. Is this normal, and how long do you think it will last. ",5

hoi flashed,5
i got relief from my stomach pain,4
"I was very apprehensive about this drug, but my doctor seemed to be confident in the benefits for my severe endometriosis.  I had just had the laporscopy surgery and 3 months later my pain was back full blown.  About 48 hrs after my 1st (and last) injection my mood just went hay-wire.  I could literally feel myself being so crazy in every aspect of my life.  I did have hot flashes but no night sweats.  my pain worsened, and has still not eased up.  I have IBS, which I keep under control, well the shot just made my bowels go nuts, very uncontrollable no matter what I ate.

"Because it was monthly shots (1x3mos) I did not menstruate, which was the idea.  However, the last shot really took a tole on my bones and muscles.  I also had feelings of depression. Over all it worked for its purpose.  I would like to know if there is any long term consequence from doing these injections. Still researching-:)",5

Though my pelvic pain has decreased, I have severe abdominal distention within 48 hrs of receiving the shot each month, I look about 6 months pregnant for about a week a month.  I have hot flashes which I can tolerte, but the insomnia is terrible.  I wake up about 15 times per night.  I was considered average weight when starting treatment, I have now gained over 15 pounds in about two months.  I also endure GI upset on a daily basis.  I am to receive this injection three more times to make my 6 month treatment complete.  I am considering living with the Endo pain and opting for a full hysterectomy instead of dealing with these side effects.",3
THE FIRST MONTH WAS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE WITH EMOTIONS BUT HAS SINCE EVENED OUT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE USE OF THIS DRUG TO ANYONE WITH ABNORMAL BLEEDING OR FIBROID ISSUES.,4
3rd injection resulted in severe anaphylactic reaction. Side affects were terrible. 24yo stage 3 endo. After scouring the internet I found a trial of the drugs in post op use for endo treatment. I think anyone considering lupron should print it off and discuss it with their dr. The trials concluded that it doesnt provide benefits to women TTC.

"I had 4 injections of Lupron last yr for Endomrtriosis. I was in so much pain every month that I would have to miss days from works because of it. This shot has help me in so many ways. To this day I still have not gotten a period since I received the 2nd injection. This shot may help some, may not not I am happy to say it help me. ",5
Had my first injection 3 weeks ago for fibroids and haven't noticed any changes as of yet. For the price of this medication I guess I expected results right away!!!,1
"I was on the 3month set of injections from June through August. I went through the hot flashes & cold sweats. My memory degraded as I went through this process & it has deteriorated since then. My cramps are still really bad, to the usual point where I have to go to the ER for some sort of relief. A month after the last injection, I saw 4different types of doctors, including a neurologist, & they all stated my dizzy spells, blackouts & severe headaches were in result of the depot lupron injections. My endometriosis is located on a fallopian tube & was told this was my only option. If there is another option for you, I highly encourage you to take that other option. Like the other ladies stated, once you take it, there is no going back. I had no luck with this medication. Hopefully there are some of you out there that do.",1
"I was told that I should to have a hysterectomy form my large fibroids, and that a myomectomy would be dangerous, and have a long recovery period. I didn't want a hysterectomy, so I was offered Lupron Depot with add back therapy. The first month was great! No period, no pain, and I felt good and happy. The second month was not as good. The hot flashes were bad, and I was VERY moody. I received an extra 5 mg of Norethendrone, which helped. I am achey, dizzy, and tired, but it could be my thyroid. (Had cancer and had it removed recently. Side effects are many, and similar.) I got an ultrasound a little after the third shot, and my largest fibroid shrunk by nearly half! I was told I am an excellent candidate for laproscopic myomectomy. YAY! Side effects are not great, but I would do it again if I had to. ",5
"Don't take Lupron because it causes grevious, permanent injuries to many women.  Besides, it's only a temporary treatment for endo and you will still need surgery to remove the endo, so the risk is not worth it.  Please Google Lupron Victims.  The side effects are permanent so if you TRY this drug just once, there is no turning back.",1
"I took Lupron just ONCE for a fibroid and it utterly destroyed my abdominal wall, and thus my life.  I have not recovered even after major surgery.  I also had sharp shooting pains right away, and now have osteoporosis.  The drug didn't even shrink my fibroid!  Lupron is a dangerous drug that should be off the market!  ",1
"I was diagnosed with endo when I was 16 but the pain was never too bad until last October. The pain was bad enough that I couldn't function without taking prescription pain killers. I got my first injection in January and two weeks later I was almost completely pain free. I also had no side effects at all - no hot flashes, no mood swings, no dizziness. I am very happy I decided to try Lupron.",5
"Have first stage endometriosis, getting ready to take 4th injection, after 3rd injection pain was almost gone. Hoping after 4th will be completely gone. Biggest complaint for me was tiredness and hot flashes. Starting to see some breast changes, but nothing drastic. Overall I am happy I decided to try this treatment.  ",4
"I am taking Lupron Depot due to uterine fibroids and my doctor suggested I take this medication for 3 months prior to surgery.It has been horrible! My hair is falling out, my stomach is severally bloated, severe insomnia, joint pain, hot flashes and the worst part is the depression, mood swings and feelings of not being myself. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. Please beware!!!",1
"I took this medication by injection for 6 months along with progesterone. I had such invasive endo that I had to have a bowel dissection and my appendix removed, as well as many adhesions removed. This lupron/progest treatment has allowed my body to recover from the surgery. I just had an ultrasound to determine extent of damage and how much endo I still have now, and will soon see my dr to get started on a monthly BC pill which should keep the endo in check until I naturally go through menopause (I'm 47). I didn't have side effects because of taking this with the progesterone. The only real problem I had was ""reverse hot flashes"" (my term) - I got really bone chilling cold once in a while, especially when tired, but this mostly went away after a few months. I reccommend this combo medication treatment. It was a blessing to me not to have to worry about my organs being attacked by endo so I could heal and recover from very major surgery.",5
the hot flashes alone will kill you oh my god. please tell me how long does it take before the medication will be out of my system my last shot was the first of january,4
"The complaints noted by others of this drug are frightening. The night sweats, mood swings, memory loss and others can be dismal, however, the suffering, the pain, uncomfortability and or health hazards of the disorder are just as dismal if not more so. Be informed. This website can help. Be knowledgeable. Be sensible. Be understanding. The Drs/OBs/GYNs/Phys are trying to help (mostly). But,it is ultimately your decision for your treatment. Therefore, it is ultimately YOU to decide how much pain you will have, YOU to choose how much blood you will lose, and YOU who will affect the quality of your life. I decided for the drug. I dealt with the side effects, all of them. (cotton clothing is a godsend for the hot flashes)The drug gave me a chance to THINK and RESEARCH and DECIDE on treatment options that did not require 8-10 weeks of recovery time and a loss of my organs. I am thankful. OH, so very THANKFUL. ",4

Lupron Depot 3.75 was recommended by my OB Gyn to shrink my fibroids before surgery.It has been a week since my first shot and so far no side effects. The bloating and pain in my abdominal area is gone. ,5
I was put on lupron 11.25 in 2009 because i bled very bad for about 4 weeks.My ob/gyn treated me in the hospitol i had to have a blood transfusion and full hystorectomy.told him i wanted a prevenative an gave me the shot.I had horrible side effects...all the above.stopped taking it last part of 2009.started bleeding again an was a the same shape so he put me on the 3.25 once a month shot.i took my second one a couple weeks ago and I want to say i havnt had the bad side effects.I was upset at first and wanted the stronger ever 3 month one but i really cant even tell iv taken it other than i dont have a period.So the ones that have taken the 11mg an couldnt handle the side effects ask your doctor to change it to once a month an i bet you will b able to take it..oh an no weight gain!It was horrible.actually my stomach has went down an am size i have been for years...hope this helps ,5
I only received 1 injection 1 month prior to having a hydrothermal abblation. I had the injection on 9/17/10 - today is 11/09/10 and I am still having hot flashes. My doctor has assured me that they will go away soon. Does anyone have any idea of about how long I should continue to get them? My surgery was on 10/18/10 and so far it seems to have worked.,4
I have been taking the shot for 7 months now. The first month I still had a lot of pain. I had my second shot had not had any pain since. I had really bad night sweats but the doctor gave me a pill to help with that I take it at supper and have had no other problems. He just gave me another pill now to take to help with the bone help issue. So far so good. This shot is so much better than the pain that I was dealing with. I had a reaction to the 3month shot so now I can just take the monthly one. Would not change it for anything now.,5
"Lupron Depot 3 month 11.25mg has been remarkable. Before the shot, I was experiencing flooding menstral cycles and bleeding everyday until the next flooding. I had intense preasure in my uterus. Sept 8th. 2010 I had a hemmorage that caused me to lose pints of blood. I was diagnosed with fibroid tumors larger then grapefruits. My uterus was the size of being 5 months pregnant. I am 49 years old. I am hoping 2 rounds of this drug will put me in permanent menopause. My second dose will be Jan 4th. 2011. It has been a little over a week since I received this drug. The next morning the pain was almost gone. I has lost alot of weight especially through my middle and I no longer look pregnant. I have had some warm spells and some strange symptoms from time to time but nothing major. My bleeding has decreased to occasional spotting. I expect it to stop altogether. It has given me my life back.",5
"I was on this for five months to treat endometriosis. Within the first month, I experienced severe symptoms of and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Although I've been off the drug for several months, I still have fibromyalgia symptoms. ",4
"Like everyone else who's left a review, THE HOT FLASHES AND NIGHT SWEATS are too much!!!!  My first shot was in reverse for me, the monthly came down super heavy.  Just took the second shot for this month and I'll jus thave to wait to see what happens.  *Sigh*  my electricity bill... can't go to sleep w/out the air conditioner on!  ",3
The hot flashes day and night were unbearable.  I had migranes and severe mood swings. One dose and that was enough for me.,4
"I was given lupron 7.5 for inducing menopause at 30 y/o.  I have stage 3 breast cancer.  This is what doctors do when a person has hormone receptive cancer, and I don't really blame the doctor for prescribing it, BUT I wish the true side-effects were explained, and taken seriously.  I hate Lupron, and I would rather die of cancer then ever compromise my quality of life again.  I don't know how much time I have left, and I will not spend it all messed up from lupron.  It is 4 months after my only dose of this drug, and my anxiety has remained at it's highest ever, I am still weak, and i still get night sweats...hope this ends...These side-effects are SO INTENSE, I see exactly what everyone in this forum is so angry about...",3
I have been a very active paraplegic for 23 years and this medicine has destroyed my life. After a radical prostatectomy my PSA increased a little. Dr recommended LUPRON DEPOT. Sept. 1st 2009 had injection. Had 40th class reunion nov 22 and hard remember any details. Nov 24th had fall from reduced muscle strength. Had two fractures of left fibula. I went back to my Dr and my psa was non detectable so I did not need another. Told him I would never take another. I cannot even transfer into my vehicle and have to depend on para transit. Being trapped in house is no fun.,5
I was on this medication for only two months. I had a severe allergic reaction to it and was covered with hives the entire time it was in my system. The drug had no effect on my cramps and I continued to constantly be in pain. It was not worth my time or money and I do not recommend it to anyone else. Your doctor may make it seem like this is your only option for treatment but it isn't. I advise anyone seeking treatment for endometriosis to choose a different method.,1
experience hot flashes and tempraory menopause,5
ON MY SECOND SHOT LOVE IT! NO MORE PAIN. I HAD CRAMPS FOR 5 WEEKS STRATIGHT AND NOW NO MORE CRAMPING. IT'S JUST THE HOT FLASHES THAT ARE KILLER NOW! IF YOU HAVE ENDO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND TRY IT!,5
The hot flashes and night sweats are killing me.But my pain is gone.Before this point I was doing great the hot flashes were bearable. But each month they seem to get worse. and starting this month my second Month I have started to get Nose bleeds and become very tired and dizzy. Is this a normal side affect? or should I be concerned?,4
"The side effects are ridiculous! I am having severe hot flashes not only during the day but at night which is causing me not to be able to sleep. I have gained a significant amount of weight, and my mood swings are also uncontrollable. I have only taken 2 of 6 shots and I am fed up. I can just hope that the outcome is worth it because the side effects are horrible! ",3
"After DES was discontinued, my dr prescribed Lupron Depot, even though my PSA had been less than 0.1 for 10 years. Testicles atrophied, lost all sex drive, gained weight, developed joint pain, blurry vision at time.  Quit the program after 2 years, had no problems with cancer returning, PSA has remained less than 0.1 for the past 12 years.",5
When i first started taking this medication it was amazing.. but then over time i realized i would rather go through the 2 weeks of pain because of the surgery then another round of this medication. It has effected me severly and it is definitly not worth all the side-effects.. if i had known what it would put me through before i got offered to take it i would of declined the treatment and gone with the surgery right off the bat. It did help in the first few months but my endometriosis has recently returned and is worse then before. The doctor also did not describe all of the symptoms of this drug or for that matter the condition i have. So i had to get second opinions. I strongly urge you to search elsewhere for a treatment becuase lupron depot is not worth everything you willl go through.,3
"I was put on Lupron to shrink a fibroid and stop excessive bleeding.  I received 3 injections nad will never receive another.  I have had the hot flashes, which I expected but I also have experienced severe migraines, mood swings, inexplicable weight gain and bloating, sudden increase in my blood pressure....used to be very, very low....and extreme joint pain.  I have expressed this to health professionals but none will agree that it is the Lupron.  I didn't have ANY of these issues before the injections.  This is all far too coincidental for me.  I do not recommend it to anyone for anything.",1
my doctor didnt tell me all the side effects and the long term effects like permanent memory loss i hating being on this stuff,1
"My 17 year old granddaughter is on this medication.  I was wondering if anyone has experienced any seizers. She has taken 4 shots so far, but has started having seizers. Hopefully, it has nothing to do with this medcine. Has anyone experienced this?",3
"Taking this drug was the biggest mistake I ever made.  I took only ONE shot, to prepare for fibroid surgery, and I doubt I will ever be myself again.  I have a permanently swollen abdomen from fluid retention.  It has been eight months since the shot and  my weight is only 92 pounds.  I have seen four specialists.  The side effects of this horrible poison are PERMANENT and this drug must be taken off the market.  Do NOT ""try"" Lupron - once you take the shot it is too late and the effects are permanent.  If your doctor recommends this drug, you have a bad doctor!  Please check out the victims' websites all over the internet and please understand, your health can be ruined on the first shot !!!  Vision loss can occur - read the label!  This drug costs about $700/month so Abbott Labs is keeping the problems hushed up.  1100 people have died.  Google it!",1
So far my symptoms are getting worse.  All of my old pains from when I was 19 years old are back now and at this time my emotions are out of control.,1
"I will have my second injection soon and just finished my first period on lupron, it was a dream come true, barely any pain. I don't know if it is because of the injection but I have no other way to explain it. Every month my period was so painful and the meds I was on did not work. I do notice a flucuation in my mood but my life in general has been turned upside down and I am being treated for a mood disorder already. But I have great support during my ups and downs with my mood and that helps a great deal. I will see how it goes after the next couple of injections but so far so good. ",4
I am on my third round of 6 month injections since 2006 and it does not work. It is not worth the side effects and the ER visits. I think it should be pulled off the market.,1
"I started lupron for endo last march and it has taken most of my pain away. It's amazing. I also am on the add back of progesterone, which reduces the side effects of menupause. I haven't had a single side effect. I still need to occasionally take my pain medicine about the week before I'm due for inj. I'll be on this drug until I try to get pregnant.I highly recommended trying lupron for all you endo sufferers!",5
"This treatment worked really well to treat my endometriosis. I think the only down-side is that my moods were up and down constantly, which made it hard for me to work. I will say that approximately 5 minutes after my first injection I got a really bad wave of nausea and had to sit in the doctors office. But the medicine did stop all of my bleeding and took away a lot of my pain",5
"I have been on these shots for about 10 months now, I am almost pain free, the add back therapy caused irregular bleeding and major cramping so I was advised to stop them for 3 months, everything else seems to be going alright, it has definately made a difference",4
"I started to take this knowing all of the side effects i studied it extensively through the internet, nursing and pharmacology books. It was just getting hard to do somethings so i gave in to having the shot 3.25mg. I also started Prozac 20mg at the same time given by my family MD to counterbalance the depression, i was most worried about that. First month a little worse mostly hot flashes like crazy. Second month pain pretty much gone still side effects third month even better.. started hormones also helped with the hot flashes fourth shot did not even start to work. I told my doctor that it didnt even feel like it kicked in and he said i was prob right it wasnt strong  enough. So i got another 3.25mg that day which did not work either. and he is ordering the 7.5mg for this week. I am not sure when i go to the office if i am going to get that one. I quit taking my prozac because i was kinda numb.... and had lost all sex drive, that has gotten a tiny bit better.... But in reality my mass of endo (where it all started feels bigger i can feel it in my abd). and the pain is still there. I am hoping he will do laproscopy soon just to get the big mass out even. Only doing this so i can have more children. He said this is all from my C section! I don't feel like me though soo only one more shot and i am done with the lupron i wanna feel like me i can handle the pain if i have to.....",3
"After having multiple ovarian cysts, 2 laparoscopies, finding stage IV endo, and having a tube and ovary removed my Dr felt that putting me on the Lupron would be the best thing for me.  I have been trying to have children for years with no success. My doctor who performed my last surgery and recommended this drug to me is also a reproductive specialist.  He was VERY informative as to what the side effects of this drug are and how my body MAY react.  I could tell he was very informed.  He let me know that women who have gone through the same procedures as I, then taken this drug, have a much higher success rate for becomming pregnant.  I took the shot for 4 months, just ending in September of 2009.  During this time I experienced little to no side effects.  I prepared myself for the worst, but hoped for the best.  No hot flashes, very few mood swings, no depression...however, I did experience slight weight gain.  I honestly feel that if you know what you are getting into with the Lupron, that you can control some of the effects...you know WHY this is happening, which to me made it easier.  I am now over a month past my last shot and am still feeling great.  I have absolutely nothing negative to say in regards to Lupron.  I feel that this has been just the start to my wonderful future.   I wish everyone luck who takes Lupron, and can only hope that your experience will be as pleasant as mine has been.  ",5

"My first injection was on oct. 2009, the same day I took it I almost threw up!!  I have had night sweats, mood swings, severe depression, real bad memory loss, and I just fell down a flight of stairs over the weekend.  I hate this drug and have been doing research and found that there has been some deaths on FDA.gov website, and most of the reviews I read have not been good.  I just dont feel like myself and have been very spacey and hard to concentrate.  Sex suxs~!!",1
"i had taken this medication for 12 months striaght for treatment of sever endometriosis, i still bleed 365 days they gave me three different types of birth control pills with it and antidepressents. i became crazy and still in pain and still bleeding now its been about 6 years and i am 29 with severe bone loss, migraines, body aches, hair loss, pain and hot flashes and night sweats still, all which have gotten worse starting from when i was on this medication. ive gone without walking for weeks at a time due to bone aches and joint problems now all a result from this drug that noone cares to tell you about, please research this drug before using it and make sure it is what you are looking for or you could be a 29yr old feeling like your 100 too,this drug should be pulled off the market all my results state ""drug induced"" all info from each speacialist i have gone too states they feel all my problems and symtops are drug induced from a drug taken called lupron, good luck to you all. it relieved some pain fir a short time and now its worse.

"I have been on this drug for 2 months now. I choose to take this drug hoping that it would stop the abdominal pain that I have been suffering from do to the Endometriosis. It seems to be helping but it has been hard to determine. The side effects have been living hell! I have been suffering through constant hot flashes, headaches, mood swings, depression, weight gain, insomnia, joint pain, lack of energy, lack of appetite, inflammation and dryness that causes sex to be painful (which was the main problem with the Endo...), dizziness, and horrible short term memory. I am hoping that I will be pain free in 4 more months or this will have been a huge mistake. Wish me luck.",3
I had the worse endometriosis bout on file it was surrounding my liver.  I was in so much pain I would pass out and not remember what happened.  I was on the drug for 12 months first for six after the surgery than the pill for 3 months then back on lupron for another six.  I have been pain free the whole time and now it has been almost five months and I am pregnant.  Doctors always told me I could never get pregnant and after the surgery I really believed they were right.  Just goes to show you your body can do anything and doctors may not always be right.  Miracles can and do happen!,5
"This tx has been a godsend for me.  Id undergone surgeries to remove tumors and also an ablation. Id been miserable since the onset of puberty when I got my first period at the age of 12. I wish this tx existed when I was 18. It would've saved me a lifetime of agony. My dr. started this tx after recovery from last surgical procedure.  Id been on the pill, but that was not as effective in curbing my symptoms and I experienced bleeding in between cycles. I love it.I have no   pain, no bloating or discomfort and don't have to take oxycodone ,flexeril to manage my pain issues. Ive taken up weight training  and have actually  gained muscle and have more stamina due to not having a cycle . My sex drive actually improved.  Before  it was painful due to symptoms and declined after surgical/pill tx's.  Now my libido has improved after Lupron  significantly, more positive and more often  . What I dread the most is when I go off the shots. I feel the difference once the drug starts to level off. Mood swings, bloating , achiness in lower abdominal area. I want to continue as long as possible and keep training my body to become stronger. Im also running and taking vitamin/herbal supplements. Ive been researching other alternative options to enhance the positive results Im now experiencing. Mine is probably atypical since not everyone can be on this med.     For me, its been very positive and effective.   ",5
"I absolutely loved this medication. After wasting money I did not have on other possibilities the day after I got this shot my pain was gone. I was so happy because I have had to go on with this pain for 5+ years as if I were just fine.  Unfortunately my employer dropped a lot of my insurance benefits and I am now unable to afford my medication. So I am now experiencing the side effects as the medication goes away, the hot flashes are crazy but other than that it was great for one month at least.  ",5
"prescribed aygestin and experienced severe hot flashes, headaches/migraines, foggy head, tiredness, dizziness doctor though depot lupron would be better now I have nausea with the other symptoms.  I am only 4 days into the shot so I start bleeding if I do not take the aygestin every 6 hours.  Abdominal pain and all other side effects make this drug not worth it.  I wish my doctor had been more honest and I had done research before I let my doctor bully me into this course of treatment.  I am scheduled for a hysterectomy on 10/14/09 at 35 and do not recommend this drug or aygestin for anyone who wants to maintain sanity and control over body.",2
"I am on my 5th shot of Lupron and I am satisfied so far with the results.  The only thing I don't like is that it lowered my sex drive, but compared to the pain that I suffered before, it is worth it.  I had very heavy periods with severe cramping.  For two weeks of every month, I couldn't function because of severe fatigue and pain.  My period was so heavy that I was taking presciption iron pills to combat extreme anemia.  One doctor told me that I would need a hysterectomy to relieve my symptoms, but I got a second opinion and my new doctor prescribed Lupron.  Now-though I've had some mood swings and minor hot flashes-I can get on with my life.  And I'm saving a bundle on sanitary products because I don't have a period.  Yay!",4
This is my second round of Lupron. The first time I was pain free for about 3 months. This time I have felt no relief from being on the Lupron. I gained 40# last time so this time my doctor add Aygestin daily along with the monthly Lupron. This is supposed to help with the side effects. It has seemed to make them more intense than before. The only positive thing is that I am not gaining the weight. The only reason it works that way is that I am so nauseous from taking the drug I can't even bare to smell food let alone eat it. The other thing I am noticing is joint and bone aches. This has not seemed worth it.,2

"i am 24 yrs old and have been having pelic pain most of my life or well i should say since i hit puberty. i have been on the shot 4 6 months and have yet to see any good come out of it still horriblr pain, night sweats, hot flashes like crazy, very moody, confusion. i am very disatisfied with this medicine",1

"I got my third shot today.  This drug has been a miracle for me.  Before, I had horrible pelvic pain 20-25 days a month and horrible periods.  My pain decreased substantially after the first shot and went away completely after the second.  I have not had a period since the first month of the shot, so I not longer have horrible cramps from that.  My only concern is that all my symptoms will come back once I'm off the shot.",4
"At the age of 22 I have been on the Depo shot for 3 months now, and love it.  Before I was having severe abdominal pain, pain with intercourse, and nightly attacks feeling a lot like appendicitis.  Everyone’s body reacts differently to medicines and yes I’ve had night sweats, insomnia, and I can tell I am a bit more moody, but I am very happy with the overall results.  I have not had an ounce of pain since I have been on this shot.  ",5
"I was very apprehensive about this drug-but after the Lap surg, 6 months of non stop bleeding, trips to the ER, and the chronic ""GI"" issues-I was desparate-and pleasantly suprised. The pain is gone, the bleeding stopped, and the ""GI"" issues ceased. My Dr prescribed ""add back"" therapy so my side effects have been minimal-Would defenitly take again in the future. ",5
"I finished my last shot on January 21/09.  I had severe pain during the entire 6 months on the shot.  I had hot flashes, night sweats and fuzzy brain.

Maybe accupuncture works if you are consistant. I still have the pain and now told by my doctor the pain is in my head...  Its a very invasive treatment that does not work. ",1
"i just finished my 6th and last shot.  I did not have many side effects.  I did have hot flashes, but they told me to drink lots of water and that helped.  I had my last shot a month ago and already hurting again.  If it helps me get pregnant it will be worth it, but it does not look hopeful.",3
"I only started treatment yesteday. I am just looking for some advice on what to expect with this medication. I'm really not sure, I am only 25 and really scared as to what is going to happen, so if anyone could please give me some advice. Thanks",2
"I started having very severe pain during my period after I had my son, about 1 1/2 years later.  I had a laps. surgery, found out I had endo and dr put me on lupron depot.  After the 2 shot my periods were gone, Yea!! no pain.  The side effects have been widespread from tired to insomnia(but you can get a lot done!) mood swings and such.  I would do it all over again though!!  ",4
"Wow! I think the medication is great. before I started using it I had terrible pain, it was so bad I could not get out of bed for 3-4 days in a row. The great asset to this medication is no more menses cycles Yea! and no more pain. Whew! I hate giving myself a shot but, I gotta do what I gotta do! It would be nice if they could come out with a patch or something oral. I wish the rest of you the best of luck and hang in there give it a chance.",5
I had my first Lupron shot two weeks ago for ovarian remnant syndrome and to stop the growth of a inclusion cyst 5 months after having my ovaries (and a previous cyst) removed. So far-so good. Pain has decreased somewhat. Literally one hot flash! NO sex drive at all...I will have two more injections and then we'll see if it did what it's supposed to do...shrink the cyst and get rid of the pain altogether.,3
"I am on my first shot and I am having a very hard time with this drug, if I am not angry I am crying I have the shakes, rapid heart beat, and the feeling that I am crawling out of my skin. I have always had problems with hormones in the past but I have never felt like I was litteraly going insane! I am also having moments where I swear that I have just gone up in flames. I have not experienced tiredness I am the opposite I have more energy and when I go to the gym I am stronger and as far as my pain it is a little better but if this is how every month is going to be I would rather be in the pain I have an 8year old and a 6month old so this kind of crazy is not good",3
"I have Pelvic Congestion syndrome, and was given the shot for my pain and many other symtoms. It has been a week so far, my mood is much better, the pain is alittle worse, but the swelling in my pelvic area is definetly going down. I will update my progress.",3
"I have just taken my 3rd Lupron shot.  I am 30 years old (with two little boys) and at times feel I am in an 80 year old body.  I have always been a very active person.  I am working with one of the best doctors.  The side effects have been absolutely horrible.  My doctor has been treating the side effect with medication which entails 9 different pills twice daily.  My side effects consist of joint pain in my ankles, knees and wrists; weakness in my legs which makes it hard to walk up stairs.  When I exercise or even vaccum I get realy dizzy.  I feel at times my muscles are not there.  My anxiety and depression has started to increase.  As an instructor at a college I tend to forget allot of things while I am teaching.  After the second month I did have releif from the pain caused from the endometriosis.  I am pretty much trying to suck it up.  My pain before the Lupron was severe, I couldn't sleep, I was so tired, physically I couldn't do the simple things like cleaning house it was too painful.  Now I can do the normal things but I have to take breaks and sit after about 45 minutes or I will have severe back pain and then my legs will start to hurt.  IF I cannot get through this shot I will be having a hysto.  I am hoping this will be helpful to everyone that is thinking of doing the Lupron shot.  When making the decision I think it depends on the severity of your pain.  Because you get to a point you just want the pain to go away.",3
I'm going in for my 4th shot this week and so far I'm still in pain there's no difference. The hot flashes are the worst thing along with the irritability. I feel sick all the time and always have a headache.,2
i have been on this drug for two months and have had verry little side affects the pain is almost gone still some here and there i would recomend this to any one who has had pain ,4
I'm 26 and supposed to take my 3rd shot next week...Since being on this medicine i take lots of depression medicine and I have SERIOUS thoughts of suicide...my hot flashes aren't bad but i have alot of nausea and vomiting. My head spins and occasionally I have cramps. My relationship with family and friends is bad. THere are days where I dont even want to get out of bed..I DO NOT recommend this medicine to anyone!!!,5
"Took the shot for 4 months. I was supposed to go for a 6 month cycle but I could not do it. I had severe hot flashes, anxiety, depression, mood swings, and insomnia. I was places on ""add back therapy"" to help with the bad side effects & nothing helped. My last shot was June of 2007 & I am still experiencing the hot flashes and insomnia. Every once in a while I will experience mild anxiety. The worst part of it was even while I was on the medication, my pain was never fully alleviated. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone!",2
"Was tired of being in pain all the time. I was recommended to start medication until my scheduled Full- Hyst. After the first dose... Started my period 3 days later, that lasted for 16-17 days. I aquired extreme side effects. Bad joint/ muscle pain, continuing headaches, irritability, loss of appetite, Hot/cold flashes, trouble sleeping/staying asleep, vivid dreams. I only took 1x and have not returned for more. Has been 1 1/2 mths since then, still feeling it all. I would rather deal with pain, then side effects. Can't wait for the Hysto! Please be careful. Especially cost! Not paying $1,000.00+ to feel worse!",2
"I was given the lupron shot & was told that I would only have hot flashes lol , I had Fibroomyalgia before the shot was'nt having any problems with it (fibro) until the shot I am in so much pain now it's horrible ! Dr says never heard of such reactions from shot wont do anything for me has to run its course should be out of my system soon . what do i do in the mean time for the fatigue , headaches, pain, depression , the list goes on ! ",1
"I WAS ON THE 3.75 INJECTION..CONTINUED TO HAVE SEVERE PAIN AND BLEEDING..SO MY DOCTOR PUT ME ON THE 7,5..AND IM STILL HAVING SEVER PAIN AND BLEEDING..IM NOT LONGER ON THE SHOT!",1
"I took Lupron for 6 months(last shot Feb 2007.) I am still having side effects from the drug.Dr told me the drug could possibly stay in my system for 3 years. My pain has began to come back and most side effects are fading except headaches, fatigue, and most of all loss of sex drive. I had just got married when I started the 6 month series and I thought I would be better by now but things are still not any better. I would not recommend this treatment to anyone, it is not worth it!!!",3
"I have been on Lupron for 4 months, and I recently had to stop treatment due to the fact that I now have Vertigo ( Dizzy) The doctor says I got the Vertigo from the Lupron so he took me off of it. Now I feel like the pelvic pain is starting to creep up on me again so I am getting a 2nd opinion. I feel that putting up with the Endometriosis is much better than having night sweats, sweating in general, insomnia, dizzy, vomiting, and other uncomfortable pain. ",3
"I was given lupron in 1994 and it was a horrible experience. I was given lupron again in 2008 and a hormone ring and the hormone addition made a big difference.The first 4 shots, I felt great, have some bone and muscle pain but it is manageable. Starting with # 5 shot, I have had spotting and bleeding, cramping, just not feeling well.I was told to take out the hormone ring and I did but I put it back in because of the hot flashes. I am a week away from being off the lupron, don't know what is next?",3
"I had a laparoscopy because I was not able to get pregnant and the Dr. discovered moderate endometriosis.  He immediately put me on Lupron for 6 months.  I was already depressed because of the two years of unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant.  Lupron made the depression deepen severely.  I also had the late day headaches (which were crushing), insomnia (for the first time in my life), and most of the other menopause symptoms to some degree. My doctor put me on a low dose HRT and that helped the headaches. I did not get pregnant after I finished the 6 month of Lupron and have now moved on to a fertility specialist.  If your main issue is infertility, please go see a good infertility doctor before you try Lupron. You may be able to avoid this treatment.  It's rough.  I would not take it again.",1
"i've been on this drug for 2 months, i've had nothing but bad times with it. my depression got worse, mood swings out of control. my husband of 20 years is so worried about me that he won't leave me alone, for fear i may kill myself.  i'm 38 and can't wait for my dr to take it ALL out!  he doubled my prozac and put me on hormones to try to ""make me feel better"".  it hasn't happend yet!  i guess i'll have to go see him again, spend MORE money, just to be told that nothing else can be done.",1
"I feel absolutely HORRIBLE on this drug. I just got my 2nd shot 3 days ago and have been so depressed that I don't feel like doing ANYTHING. I was on Lupron once before but because of side effects stopped after one shot. I feel nauseous, restless, irritable, tired and I have severe cramps that feel like mild labor pains. I would rather put up with the discomfort of endometriosis than feel like this every day, all day. My mood swings are awful. I don't know how I make myself go to work everyday because I can't concentrate when I'm there. I will NOT get my 3rd shot. I just want to feel normal again. It's affecting my family and social life, also. Please only use this drug as a last resort. I would rather have surgery once a year than feel like this.      ",3
"This is my 4th month on the shot. Yes, the side effects are there if you concentrate on them enough. But after having suffered for 15 years with Endo, 5 surgeries and years of TRYING to get pregnant, I am at ""peace with my pelvis"" for the first time since early teenage years. No periods, no pain at all. I am told that it only safe for 6 shots.. I dread getting OFF the shot. It has been a wonderful drug that I wish I could have taken so long ago.",5
"I AM NOW ON MY SECOND TREATMENT OF LUPRON. THE FIRST WAS WHEN I WAS 14. IT WAS THE WORST 6MONS OF MY LIFE. I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH ENDO FOR 12 YRS. & EVEN THOUGH I HAD A HORRIBLE FIRST EXPERINCE MY DOCTOR GAVE ME NO OTHER OPTIONS. I'VE HAD 3 SURGERIES, TEN YEARS AGO & THE THIRD 2 MONTHS AGO. I STILL HAVE PELVIC PAIN & IRREGULAR BLEEDING. I KEEP BEING TOLD ""WELL YOU SHOULD BE FEELING BETTER BY NOW."" THE NIGHT SWEATS, NO SEX DRIVE & MOOD SWINGS ARE JUST ADDING TO THE PAINFUL CRAMPS. I WILL FINISH MY 6MONTH TREATMENT BUT IF I AM EVER TOLD I NEED TO TAKE THIS AGAIN I WILL NOT.",1
"I have been living with Endo for several years. I recently had a laproscopy and started Lupron. I am on my secone injection and due to start my third. I have had no period however the headaches are close to unbearable. I don't have many hot flashes but every evening I get a terrible head ache accompanied by a low grade fever( 101.1-101.9)and chills that has been consistent for 8 days now. I originally was concerned about post op infection but all my blood work and chest Xray were fine.Both my gyno and MD think its not the injection but my gyno. wanted to hold off on taking the next inj. for 1 week. Until they can find some reason for the daily elevated temp., which only spikes at night, my opinion is Lupron definitely should not be excluded....I sure hope the outcome is worth it. I would like to fall asleep one night without a fever.",4
"I took this for 5 months after a lap for endometriosis. It's hard for me to tell whether it helped the pain, because I subsequently developed a bladder condition that has been causing me a lot of pain. But the Lupron was a horrible experience that is still having a huge negative impact on my life. The first two months weren't too bad, just lots of nausea. Then the mood swings, depression, lack of sex drive hit. I toughed it out for a while, but refused to take my sixth and final injection.  But four months after my last shot, the side effects are not diminishing. I'm a wreck, and it's damaging my personal relationships and my career. Please, please investigate this drug fully before you decide to take it. My doctor was NOT AT ALL knowledgable about this drug before she had me take it, and therefore I was not fully aware of the problems this drug could cause. ",2
"I started taking the shot in August of 07 and took it until March of 08. I was pain free about 3 weeks after the initial injection and still am. The hot flashes bothered me the whole time I was on it. Also, the mood swings were BAD!!! Overall, the biggest thing that affected me was the fact that I gained 45 lbs durring the 8 month treatment. On the bright side, I have been off the shot for 2 months and the pain has not come back so far. ",5
"I had to use this drug as a child for ""precosious puberty"". I was an infant, and now that I am almost 21, I have loads of questions about what the side effects, if any, effect me now. I was stopped suddenly by my mother because the drug was still experimental at the time. I did have a fairly early period at age 10, but better than Kindergarden, as projected before its use. I am average height, so my bone age did slow down as projected. My periods are about normal but took a while to regulate in early puberty. I am just left with a lot of questions about my egg count, how long do I have until menopause, and did the drug cause any other side effects inside of me that I am not aware of yet?   I am a virgin, so pregnancy is not an issue, and will not be until marriage. I remember taking the drug as a toddler. The shot is painful for children, and then the invasive tests are still in my memory. In the end, I am okay with my mother's decision about the drug, and glad she took me off of it when she did. Now, all I have are some questions now that I am older, and wanting answers. There is little research about the side effects from childhood going into adulthood.",3
"Lupron is the only treatment that has made me pain free. I have suffered from endometriosis for 14 years. I have had many surgeries, including a partial hystorectomy. My doctor put me on Lupron with hopes that I will still be able to hve children. The side effects suck, but I will deal with them if it keeps me out of pain. I recommend this drug to anyone who has suffered the horrible pain from endometriosis.",5
"I am 27 and started using Lupron for Endo, and it works dont get me wrong but the side effects are not fun. I can't wait to get off it and have my hystorectomy",4
I was put on Lupron because I'm starting IVF and this was suggested by the doctor because of my history with endometriosis.  First month was no big deal but then I was told that I would be on it for another month. I got my second shot last week and the hot flashes are a little annoying and my body feels like it is on fire when I sleep but the vertigo is what makes it difficult.  Just to type and looking at the screen makes me dizzy.  But it did stop the cramps and back pain.  I guess it will be worth it when I get pregnant.  ,4
"I had Endometriosis for 9 years, since I was 20 years old, and during those years dcts in several states prescribed me every kind of pain killer imaginable..I hated that, I felt like I was dependent on those things. None of those dcts took my pains serious. So once I started the Lupron shot Dec 08, I have had nothing but success. I have had the hot flashes, mood swings, low sex drive,no period(not complaining about that one) but all of those are worth it to be pain free! I am in my last 3 months,just got a 3 mo shot, and so far I have been very satisfied. The pain stopped almost instantly after the second shot. As of right now I am very happy with the results, I just hope things continue once this is out of my system. I recommend anyone who has dealt with pain for as long as I have, to at least try it. You wont know how it effects you until you try, it effects everyone differently. Good luck and I hope this helped.",4
"I have had 5 out of 6 lupron shots so far.  The first 2 made my endo pain worse, the third seemed to clear everything up and i felt great.  The 4th caused back pain, fever, chills.  The 5th caused SEVERE back pain ( i couldnt even sit), fever, chills and a rash on my back...one more to go!  The side effects i had were mild to moderate hot flashes, pretty bad night sweats, constant crying, moody, mild acne, and the worst of all in my opinion severe hair loss!  Although i would do it again if i had to because the pain i was in for months is gone.  Hope this helps.",4
"I have been experiencing pelvic pain for a while and cysts that keep bursting on my ovaries.  My doctor has ran all kinds of tests and has not found and thing other than the cysts on my ovaries, so he decided to give me a shot of Lupron to kind of shut everything down and see if this helps with the pain and cysts.  It has now been almost one week since my first shot and I have not had a appetite and I am in more pain than I was starting out.  I called my doctor and he told me that this is all normal and when I go into the office for my second shot it will be all better from that point. I have not had any of the hot flashes or anything, but as for eating and the pain being worse it worries me a little.  So ladies so far not to bad, but I will keep you updated!!!",3
"I HAD BEEN IN A LOT OF PAIN FOR A WHILE. THE SHOT ITSELF TOOK AWAY A LOT OF THE PAIN BUT THE SIDE EFFECT NOT SO GOOD. SWEATING LIKE U WOULD NOT BELIEVE, HOT FLASHES, NIGHT SWEATS, NO APPITE, AND NO SEX DRIVE. IF UR N A LOT OF PAIN, N MY EYES WHATEVER WILL HELP I WILL DO. I HAVE 2 CHILDREN OF MY OWN AND 3 STEP CHILDREN SO I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR PAIN.  ",3
"think it over carefully.  this shot made me so sick that my severe endometriosis and fibroids are easier to live with (at least for now, 5 months post-operative) than the side effects.  i took it for a few months and didn't finish the cycle.  couldn't sleep, hot flashes ALL THE TIME.  sounds like no big deal but it was wretched.  hopefully it helps some, but be careful deciding to do it.  intolerable for me.  NEVER NEVER again.  a thoroughly horrible experience.  ",3
"I was on lupron for six months. Only side effect was hot flashes, which were SO much easier to deal with than the previous debilitating pain. My periods completely stopped. I loved it, loved it, loved it!",5
"I had stage IV endometriosis and 16 fibroid cysts, one of which was cancerous. My Dr. placed me on this drug to sustain and stop the endometriosis by putting me into menopause. My Doctor was very clear on the side affects. However; after 6 months of being on this shot, the endometriosis came back. Other risks are possible now, but I would have to get a radical hysterectomy at 35. I would like to have children and this is the only way. The hot flashes and night sweats are more within the fist few days after the shot and then a few days before the shot. It did discontinue the cancerous cyst from coming back, so it is a 50/50 feeling. I hope this may help someone.",3
"After three weeks into the injection I have begun to experience mood swings, headaches, as of yet my period has not come.",3
"I have suffered severe and horrible pain since using this drug. I have had memory problems, vision problems, and vertigo. I have had sudden attacks of high blood pressure. I cannot get this drug out of my system and it terrifies me. I cannot receive treatment for this drug and my medical bills have mounted. Do not use this drug.",1
"Lupron was given to me over 3 years ago.I lost my job, used my retirement, my cobra expired. I am in debt since I              was hospitalized. Self pay is charged more than double. I had so much due to my hard work and this has been taken away from me.Now I have bill collectors calling me and I find that very difficult, my family never had to deal with a collection agency.I have lived with terrible bone and joint pain everyday due to this poison that was put in my system. I don't believe the doctor read his PDR about this drug and had only relied on what the sales person told him when he got the free drugs.To make it even more painful, I have been told it is all in my head by a surgeon, another doctor told me I have a mood disorder.Many other women have heard things like that from other doctors.  Tap the maker of this drug owes me for the over three years and my medical bill plus my retirement. They had reps out in the field not telling the truth about the drug.NOw over three years later doctors are starting to tell the truth about this drug.",1
"The first few months on this were extremly rough for me. Then again I was 16 and going through a chemically enduced menopause. I missed out on a lot of things that normal teenage girls get to do, until my doctor suggested this. I was scared but since I was on Lupron I haven't had any signs of the endometriosis again. I was on it for a year and a half. ",4
My Drs office often had problems w the delivery so I never knew if I was gonna be able to receive the injection on time. The night sweats & hot flashes were almost unbearable. I had menstrual bleeding for months at a time. The pain never went away. I lost weight from the loss of appetite from the pain. I had problems w acne in the past but the Lupron made it horrible. I hated to go out in public the acne got so bad. That contributed to major depression issues and even a suicide attempt while on the therapy. The Drs didnt want to give me any prescription pain meds for the pain so I missed a lot of work and spent most of the time lying in bed trying to cope while taking Naproxyn or Tylenol that didnt even begin to help the pain. I wouldnt recommend this drug to my worst enemy. I also suggest that if ur dealing with Endometriosis u get a femal OBGYN because my male Dr had no compassion at all. Only a woman can truly understand a womans body and the pain surrounding it.,3
It was a great experience for me. I was upset that I had to get off of this medicine. I suffered maybe 2 quick hotflashes but other than that..that's it!!! It was a life-saver.,5
"Hot flashes every hour, night sweats almost unbearable, gaining weight about 1.5 lbs per week (even on diet).  Tried Effexor for hot flashes -- it worked but the side effects were worse than the hot flashes.  Will likely not have another Lupron injection -- will try using only Casodex + Avodart.",3
"Have Been using lupron for 15 years, and psa is less than 0.1",5
"Hot flashes, Night sweats, tired, & trouble sleeping. First dose (4 month shot) was Mar. 21, 2014, second was July 21",5
"Many, many side effects such as headache, muscle aches and pain, depression, suicidal ideation, no energy, fatigue, exhaution, decreased strength, mind fog and nocturia",2
works well but must deal with hot flashes throughout the day...just carry a handkerchief and catch a breeze,4
"PSA 25, Gleeson 7 Had 6 month shot one month before starting radiation. PSA after 42 treatments 0.14- PSA one month later and before 2nd 6 month shot 0.12 today. It did seem to turn me into a somewhat grumpy moss covered rock with no patience, stamina, some hot flashes and seems like dozens of other side effects but it was evened out by lack of interest and memory about bad things that faded quickly. Can't really confirm that it is helping but just consider it as my personal little stealth fighter. Mine is considered a presumptive disease caused by Agent Orange due to service in Viet Nam and is usually more aggressive. ",5
Night sweat's tired all the time and bad shortness of breath,3
"Impotence,increased bone pain ,extreme mood swings, Night swets,along with sleeplessness only positive is my Psa is lower after 2nd treatment.",4
"I too am having severe muscle pain and joints pain such as the finger joints. I am tired all the time but I keep moving, and I do not stop throughout the day. I hate getting out of bed because my body is so sore and painful stiffness has set in the joints. I just had my second four month shot, and I have unwelcome hot flashes and just currently experiencing some GI issues. I was always very sexually active, and that flew out the door real fast, and it has me very upset about the situation. My first five weeks on the Lupron showed only a few side affects such as hot flashes; then all heck broke lose! I am told that I will be on Lupron for a total of 18 months in combination of 45 radiation treatments. I am concerned about the residual chemical still in my system when it is compounded with the next shot. In essence, I have to wait and see as this stuff seems not to hit me until the first several weeks pass; then it's game on...  :-(",4
"The hot flashes are a serious nuisance, but better than the alternative of no treatment.",5

"My experience with this medicine has been horrific to say the least. But according to my insurance company I had to try certain things before they would say okay, a histerectomy is obvious since the patient has had no success. I am 3 shots in, due for my 4th on the 16th which i will not be taking. My Dr has me set up for a 6 month shot therapy. I was hospitalized 6/6/11 due to severe right flank pain , nausea, migraines. My pain was so severe that it had become unbearable. Well here it is the 11th & have been diagnosed with IBS, erosive gastritis, & these shots threw my body into menapause. They're hoping I'll be able to go home tomorrow. I've been on a liquid diet because when I would eat within 10-15 minutes everything I ate would come right back up. So I have to be able to eat so I can go home. They're taking me off the Lupron shots & now I have IBS to deal with for the rest of my life. I'm not necessarily wanting to have surgery, I just want to my happy go lucky positive self, be 'me' again. I haven't felt like me for a few months. It has been by the grace of God himself that I made it as far as I have dealing with all this pain & misery. It will also be by the grace of God himself that I will overcome this with the help of my doctors to keep me from living with the pain of endometriosis. ",1
"I've taken these injections 4 times in the past.  In June 2010 my PSA was 0.2; went down to 0.1 after 4 months; went down to non-readable after 4 months; went up to 0.2 again this month (June 2011).  Originally, prior to treatment of radiation (about 12 years ago), my PSA was 9.6.",5
"My Gleason 6 & 7 (2 spots in prostate) but told I had early malignancy. This one 4 month inj. did lower my PSA from 1.7 to .06, however, I felt tired after the 2nd month.  When I finally started checking my BP during those times, my Blood pressure was tanking.  This happened several times during each day, going from 81/52 to 72/44, 60/40, 62/43, 71/46 and then back to near 107/68 which is still not normal for me (133/80).  Webb MD mentions abnormally low BP as rare side effect, however, we could not find a doctor who had ever heard of hypotension as a side effect.  I am dizzy, blurred vision, weak/faint during these episodes.  It has restricted my activities totally.  When I do anything that requires stooping/bending I have an episode.  Has anyone else checked their BP during their weak/fainting episodes?  Could be low BP. How long does lupron stay in the system as I am 6 months past the one injection and still having Low BP, hot flashes, blurred vision, tiredness dizziness, etc? There was a Heart Attack/stroke warning added by the FDA last October.  I wonder what caused that to be added at such a late date.  ",3
Had severe endometriosis-pain was excruciating. First month on depot lupron pain was almost gone....the second and third months the pain was gone but the side effects were quite uncomfortable..much better than the endometriosis but still bad. Hot flashes lasting about 10 minutes where I felt dizzy and my chest felt heavy...and the worst was sleeplessness ,5
I received first injection 4 days ago,1
"my husband had prostate removed 1993 and is now 72 years old.  he had stage 4 cancer.  since taking the lupron injections he has had some unexplained episodes of intermitant head pain (shooting shocks he calls them) that last from an hour to a day.  he also began having seriously high fevers, 103-104, and non responsiveness that got him to the ER several times.  does this sound familiar to anyone else?  we need help.  ",4
I am on the third 4 month dose of this drug.My PSA has gone from 19.5 before trearment to.05 after the first 4 month shot and to .02 after the second 4 month dose . Iam now on the third 4 month dose and will have my PSA checked after I give blood on 7/2.,5
only had 1 treatment so far,3
besides the hot flashes this drug ha really helped me with endometriosis,5
"the hot flashes and night sweats are terrible. My bones are constantly aching after the first injection. I have mood swings, dizziness, and concentration problems, numbness in my left arm along with tingling in my hands.",5
"severe muscle cramps, moderate bone loss in less than 6 months of use, severe GI problems, weight loss, stomach bleeding, anemia.  may be great for some, but if you have any allergies or any kind of stomach sensitivity, WATCH OUT! had to stop after one year, side effects worse than disease.",3
"Was a very hairy man but have lost all chest and back hair as well as hair in my arm pits. Have lost all urges of sexual desire along with erection problems and also the  possibility of erection size by  2-3"". Sometimes have sleepless nights and have resorted to natural sleeping pills ",4
I was diagnosed with endometriosis. The side effects of this medicne began after 3 days and progressively got worse. My mood swings effected my family and my work. I feel like I am demented and everything I do is a frustrating task that I cannot complete. I am only on my second shot and cannot stand whats happening.,3
"I started Lupron Depot 4 month injection three weeks ago to stop my period....I am a four year survivor of breast cancer.  The side effects have been very difficult, including regular and frequest dizziness, fatique, weakness, and headaches.  I do not know whether it is effective at this point.  I will not stay on the medicine as the side effects are too bad.  They are, in fact, reminiscent of chemotherapy....  ",3
"Fifteen years ago, my husband was given 5 years to live because his cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. He has been on Lupron depot for the past 14 years. He has also been taking Casodex for the past 10 years or when it first came out.  He takes naps when necessary but he is still very active.  He has complained this past year of bone pain and some dizziness.  My husband is 84 years old and takes care of 15 steers, 2 horses and 2 dogs.  Last year he stacked 100 bales of hay by himself.  He has a strong faith in God, a positive attitude and a sense of humor.  I'm sure the Lupron and Casodex also helps.  He believes in quality of life and not quantity of life.  I hope this review helps other advanced cancer patients.",5

The only measure of it's effectiveness is a PSA level of >1.4 during a 21 month period. My weight gain is ~20# with restless sleep.,3

"Minimal night sweats, no dizziness, minimal weight gain (near impossible to lose weight), some aches in joints but not noticeable beyond existing arthritis. I did best on the medication for 18 mos. (6 inj.) and then off for up to 18 mos. or when PSA began to climb (usually double).  I feel the inj. allows me to live longer with minimal interruption of daily life.",5
"Had radiation treatment, ended 9 Dec 14. PSA was 15.7 at start now .02 for 3 tests. DR. says the DRE soft and no bumps, I should be very happy. I need to take this stuff so I do: but it does have a few side effects. Hot flashes (can be troublesome to totally awful can also  causes cold flashes ""ick""): Received prescription to help with hot flashes, ANTI-DEPRESINT: works but it is not perfect, can leave you tired and felling like a zombie.  Mood swings can be epic:  Yesterday I started to cry at lunch in a restaurant and just could not stop! Lupron likes to ""hang out with my arthritis"". Memory is a ""bit mushier"", name recall just awful, but it was never excellent.  Concentration on a project is more difficult.  Getting bored is easy.  If you take Lupron try to set aside 10 hours a day for sleep!  Problem here is I get up 4 to 5 times every night to go ""pee"" and that involves sitting (absolutely on standing) for 4 to 6 minuets. But I stand during the day and it is no different that it was before.  SO go Figure. Sleep is a real problem -- I have sleeping pills, I would rate them on a scale of 1 to 10 about a 3;  sleeping pills can leave me groggy in the morning, but that only last until noon, GEE WHAT A GOOD deal! SO, I BITCHED enough; I need to have this stuff in me for another year, AND I WILL DO IT!",5
"The Lupron shot has made my pain worse and I have gotten most of the side effects including speech issues, memory issues, and weakness in arms and legs, mostly on my left.",2

I have been sick for 7 years going to and from the doctor. I have been through two surgeries. I was so sick and my doctor recommended i get on lupron and i was very afraid at first. I got my shot in August and we are not in October. I have had hardly any side effects. This drug is a miracle drug for endometriosis. This is the only thing that has helped me cope and get through life without so much pain. I will say i do have body aches sometimes but that is all. I haven't gone through horrible hot-flashes like everyone says they do. I highly recommend speaking to your doctor if you have a severe  case of endometriosis like I did. ,5
"After reviewing information on this drug, I was PETRIFIED to begin treatment.  But, my endo was so bad that doc encouraged me to try it.  I call her my miracle worker now!!  I did have some side effects.. hot flashes, muscle aches and mood swings at the top of the list.  I began taking BLACK COHOSH.. an over the counter homeopath product which I HIGHLY recommend for any hormonal imbalance issues.. PMS, etc.. Life has never been better for me!!  ",5
"Daughter was given Lupron because her growth was stunted due to hypothyroidism, doc wanted to delay puberty to give her more time to grow. First three month dose didn't seem to stop her puberty, so doc ordered increased dose. Result was that she almost immediately became moody, cried for no reason, eventually became depressed with suicidal thoughts. We're talking about a ten year old here. This is supposed to be a rare side effect, but it wasn't rare enough in our case. Beware. If given a choice, do the one-month dose even if it's more convenient, if the patient has a bad reaction it will wear off more quickly, Our daughter started feeling herself again about 9 weeks into the 12 week dose.",2
"I had the 3 month shot for suspected endo. My heavy periods completely stopped with the first shot and pain during sex decreased a lot. The drug did exactly what it was suppose to do, and most of the side effects (I also took that add-back) were very minimal: only a few hot flashes, that weren't as bad as people made them out to be, some acne and trouble sleeping. The worst side effect was the body aches, which were severe. I am suppose to get another 3 month shot, but I am unsure if I am going to since the body aches were just as bad as the cramps at times.",4
"I started on Lupron Depot- Leuprolide 11.25mg 3 month injection April 23rd, 2015.  My OB believes I have endometriosis after MRI scan and ultrasounds showed nothing, he's basing this off of the symptoms which I have almost every system of endo.  It took away my pain, no periods for the last 2 of the 3 months.  Only symptoms I was grateful to have were minor- some acne, tired all the time, & restless sleep.  I had no hot flashes, no joint pain, etc.",5
"I'm 27 and I found out I had stage 3-4 severe endometriosis last year. I had all the horrible symptoms for endo but I honestly just thought it was normal for me. One night, I woke up with terrible, terrible pain in my lower abdomen. Turned out I had grapefruit sized cysts INSIDE both of my ovaries and they were leaking blood into my abdomen. I had emergency surgery to break open the cysts and I also had a laproscopy. My doctor managed to save my ovaries but wanted me to start the lupron injection. I didn't want to at first and tried a holistic approach but my endometriosis was just too far gone for that. More pain came my way which led to more ultrasounds which showed that my cysts were back..after just three months. Thankfully they weren't as big as before..yet. so I got the Lupron injection, because the pain was too unbearable. I've gotten the injection 3 times since last year and once it wears off I'll will be moving on to the Mirena IUD in the near future. Lupron side effects vary for everyone but yes they can be tough to deal with at times. I get horrible hot flashes many times throughout my day and also at night. I've experienced nausea, headaches, mood swings, short term memory loss, fatigue (especially after the 3rd injection), sore joints and muscles, and loss of sex drive. Hot flashes and fatigue have been constant though. I tried the pill for hot flashes and that just gave me more problems. I would recommend lupron, it really helped give my body a break from the end. If I didn't take it, I would have been back in the hospital. I also recommend following the special diet for endometriosis. It really helps me and can't imagine not following it.. I don't eat gluten, soy, dairy and stay away from meats that aren't hormone free. ",4
"I'm 53 and have endometriosis. I've taken Lupron for a year now. It stopped my period. It has helped me tremendously give me a life back as my periods were so incapacitating with the heavy bleeding and PMS/bloating beforehand for years and year except during pregnancies. The downside is the constant hot flashes and night sweats. I also have mood swings,a lot of memory loss and achy hip bones. I suppose you have to outweigh what is worse and what is easiest to deal with.In my case I would rather deal with the side effects then having to live my life around my periods and be in pain every month. I am going to stop the Lupron soon and my hope is that I will be in a ""natural"" menopause and periods will just be a bad memory! ",5
"This has been a horrible medication that I would never recommend, nor will I take it again. I had two injections, one in June and the other in September of 2013.  They did help my fibroids to shrink and I was scheduled for third injection in December when I realized that all the physical problems I had been having since the summer had been caused by the Lupron Depot. I've had severe joint and muscle pain, especially in my right shoulder, stiff neck, muscle weakness, balance problems, and nerve problems as well (numbness, tingling). I continue to have pain in my right arm and shoulder and I've lost range of motion. Massage and chiropractic have had limited results and I will probably be scheduling an MRI soon to see exactly what the extent of the damage has been to my shoulder. The medication also did not stop my period like it was supposed to. Since September however I've started juicing, and in December I started eating a mostly raw food diet, and these have helped me to lose weight and the fibroids have continued to shrink. And finally this month (March 2014) I had a very light period, but it's been six months since the last injection so I credit the dietary changes I've made. At this point I'm just hoping and praying the damage that's been done is not permanent. I would never advise anyone to take this harmful drug.",1
"My daughter started this medication at the age of 7 yearsold. She was 5-2"", wore a size 7 shoe, and 125 lbs. 1year later months later, she has severe depression, anti-social behavior at school, sleep walks and has full conversations in her sleep, lethargic and we have to force her to play sports, she has gained 30 lbs in a year even though she is consisently in the gym and non-stop sports (by force), grown 2 inches, 3 shoe sizes and has full acne. The side effects outweigh the good byfar. ",1
"Been on for 15 months, before, during and after Radiation Treatments for Prostate cancer. Side effects: continual fatigue, hot flashes/sweats, memory challenges, swollen calves/feet, swollen hands, joint pain/aches in legs & hands, body hair loss, numbing down right arm & hand. Zero libido. Mild pain sensations over lower body mostly during sleep time. Restless sleep, therefore fatigue during daytime. While benefits have been favorable, side effects have been challenging to say the least. ",5
One month,4
Between blood pressure going up and the side effect that we're not explained to me I would take it again if give the chose.,5
"I was diagnosed with endometriosis in Spring of 2013.  Lupron honestly saved my life!  For 6 months I felt normal.  My pain was gone and I took control of my life back.  I started out on the monthly depot.  Not sure of the side effects etc., I wanted to play it safe.  First month was a little ruff.  I had body aches for few days, hot flashes, and night sweats.  Second month my Dr. prescribed me the add back therapy as well and that immediately subsided the side effects.  My hot flashes were minimal, night sweats were gone and I felt like a brand new person.  Month 3, I decided to get the 3 month depot.  At the end of my 6 months, cramping started to return, got a normal period one month after being n the Lupron.  Heavy bleeding again, bad cramping and along came severe depression.  I am SO glad I had 6 months of peace and life.  I am back at square one and wish I could have went on the Lupron longer.  ",5
"had lupron injection for 3 months, I admit it stopped heavy flow of menstrual for a few months but had horrible side affects, hot flashed, sweats, major rashing and itching, acutal welts everywhere on my body I would not take nor can I take this medication again almost 11 months after 1st injection and still have side affects",2
"I dont care what anyone says, I love the lupron shot! It is the only thing that has taken away the pain and constant heavy bleeding. My only wish is that they come up with something that can be taken continuously and not just in 6 month intervals. Yes I did have side effects like hot flashes and decreased breast size but I would gladly take that over severe pain and constant horrible bleeding!",4
"I received this injection to stop the extremely heavy periods I had been experiencing for several months.  The bleeding was so bad that I had been hospitalized for low hemoglobin, which I had no idea is what was wrong with me.  The doctor gave me the shot which he obviously hoped would control the bleeding; it didn't and I bleed even more than before, for three months straight.  Finally had a partial hysterectomy but the side effect of this drug was not worth the drama I have been and still deal with over three months later.  I was been hoping that there is a way to completely remove it from my system because I got the shot in May and still feel the effect now to which I have to endure the docs telling me how eventually it should subside.  Give me a freakin break!  I hope it works for some ladies, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it if you have fibroids and have decided to have a partial hysterectomy.  It's simply not worth it.",1
"I suffered from severe endometriosis. I had two surgeries, the second surgery it completely covered my ovaries. Dr. suggested Lupron Depot shots (I actually had 4 months of it). I am now divorced earlier than I had planned (I planned on doing it in the future, but not at the moment) and I know it is because of this drug. I am a very logical person. While receiving these shots, I seriously was not myself. I couldn't stand even looking at my husband. I was irrational, emotional, crying over nothing. While this did work for my health issue, I don't think it's worth the risk of the side effects it can cause. I have decreased bone density, even though I took two other drugs to stop that from happening. I also have memory loss - I actually don't have memories of certain time periods during treatment. I would not recommend this as a treatment. Beside all of the other menial side effects (night sweats, etc.) While I realize some people don't have the side effects, I don't think it is worth the risk that you might have them. My whole life changed because of it.",4
"has been a great help in stopping my endometriosis and pelvic pain.  the only side effect i have experienced is hot flashes and night sweats.  and hair growth and acne.  overall, would recommend this drug!",5
"I received Lupron injections for the first time in 2006 prior to having surgery to remove fibroids. It worked as described, stopping my periods - but I also had the side effects of hot flashes, night sweats, etc. I didn't mind because it stopped the heavy flow and allowed me to have the surgery. I received the injections again - after having severe anemia - it didn't work as well the second time - the periods didn't stop as quickly - but I also think I wasn't as diligent in getting my injections. I'm now on it again for the thir time - again for severe anemia, requiring a blood transfusion - hemoglobin count of 4.0 (not good !) - it's only been 3 weeks since my first injection and I still got my period as scheduled - but I'm starting to experience the side effects. This time I find I'm experiencing dizziness - which I don't recall having the other two times. I also feel a little more ""foggy"" in terms of memory - but that could be due to information ""overload"" - but at 47 it could also be age. ",4
"Have had 2 injections (3 months apart) Have had renal transplant (2002) No History of   mental illness. Transplant was considered a failed transplant. ATN.kidney took 2 weeks for it to start working. Best creatinne 2.3 best hemoglobin 9-10 range. Lupron has destroyed my life. The lupron has lowered my hemoglobin to - 7.7 - 8.2 range. My mind and body consider the lupron as a real life threat,both are on extremely high alert.I have experienced - Hot flashes, chills,night sweats,sleepless nights (awake 48 hrs at a time) sleeping pills give me 4 hours of sleep. I have mood swings,can go into a deep depression,which can last from a half hour and as long as nine hours.I have tachycardia          with the highest rate of 150 with a orthostatic BP 71/47.I am extremely suicidal  with a plan in place. I went for treatment,but was told it is not treatable, by the use of medication. My mind is stressed out to the limits,and if a medication is used my mind will consider this a real life threat and I will end up taking my life. My life has been a living hell.I am fine when I have the periods when the drug leaves me alone. The drug can effect me with no notice and at any given moment. When it takes hold I have completely no desire to live,I lay in a fetal position and cry. I am completely helpless,the thoughts are from events that have taken place in the past,never the present or the future. The thoughts are extremely cruel,degrading, hurtful,and extremely painful. I sometimes wish I never would have started the prostrate treatment. My quality of life just does not exist anymore. The lupron would not make a good street drug. I only wish I had never started the drug. With the poor renal function, the drug is expected to stay in my system for an unknown period of time. The drug was DC after the second injection due to the severe side effects.   ",5
"I am 48 and have had 1 shot of lupron.Not really sure why Dr gave it to me.I had a partial hyst.13yrs ago and had some cysts on my cervix that showed up in a CT scan. I have severe scarring from 5 adominal surgerys and dr felt a complete hysterectomy was too dangerous,so gave me the shot. I have had nothing but horrible hot flashes,no sex drive,night sweats,mood swings,bodyaches etc....this drug has made me miserable.I would love to know how long this stays in a persons system! I am about to go crazy! PLEASE if you take this shot do lots of research! it is very expensive! definately did not work for me!",1
"Severe pain due to endometriosis. Shot provided, DID NOT work. Suffered ALL of the side effects & the pain did not subside. Unfotunately unsuccessful for me, but to each its own, Best of Luck Ladies!",1
"I took this as a last ditch attempt to ""control"" my periods in relation to my endo (stage 4). It never stopped my period,  had terrible achy bones, moods swings, hot flashes, blood pressure permanently affected, chest pains i still have that are not anxiety as some doctor said, severe dry chapped lips. These are the side effects I remember the most- I did take the ""add- back"" pill & still had side effects. It did not do anything other than harm my body- bad mistake to take & will always go with gut instinct next time advised. ",1
I have endometriosis for over 10 years and the pain was like having natural labor with no pain meds. I could deal with the heavy bleeding but not the pain that kept me incapacitated at times and without Lu-pron I would not have been able to function. I rather have the hot flashes and mood swing than to suffer with that type of pain and having to take Vicodin or morphine.   ,5
"I was diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer in Dec of 2005. I was put on lupron right from the beginning, my oncologist believing surgery would be of no benefit. I remained on the injections for about 2 years and then it was decided my PSA level was low enough I could do without for awhile. My main problem whike on treatment was the hot flashes and fatigue. It's been decided, due to an increase again of my PSA stats that I will probably have to resume treatment once again within a few more months. Has anyone else been in remission for more than 2 years and then suffered a reversal? My problem now is depression after believing I had this disease beaten. I also have heart problems so I don't know which will be the cause of my demise but I'm thinking I'd rather go with the suddeness of heart  failure. I'm 78 years old and have been in declining health for 6 years now.",5
I will discuss this with my Physician in private Only.,4
used for endometriosis~ didn't see to help that much& experienced side effects with bad hot flashes & night sweats,2
"My physicians treating me said I had the worse case of Endometriosis they had ever seen. I had to have a partial hysterectomy at 23 yrs of age. I begged them to take my ovaries due to my mother dying of ovarian cancer at just 39 yrs, but he refused. Now due to his decision, I have endometriosis all through out my abdomen. I had to take Lupron injections & radiation txts every 28 days for 10 months. The side affects were horrible and to make matters worse they didn't help. I had to have more surgery. They done a complete hysterectomy, removed several adhesions from endometriosis from my bladder, intestions, organs, etc. and the nightmare still was not over. The oncologist told me I had to do more Luron txts; but the 3 month txts this time. What would I recommend to other women: DO NOT TAKE!! They do not help. They destroy bone, cause migraines, and joint pain and do not cure endometriosis as promised. All it does is drain your wallet and health! ",1
"After some very painful and heavy periods that would last over 20 days, I have been diagnosed with rather large fibroids. I researched the Lupron Depot before agreeing to take the 3 month injection. Two days after taking the shot I began to bleed. I am experiencing my body temperature being a lot warmer than usual but that is the only side effect. I don't have mood swings and I sleep well at night. I have no more pain however I have been bleeding very lightly for 20 days now. Today makes 3 weeks since taking the shot and I am praying the bleeding stops. I'm certain the Lupron is working because there is no pain and no heavy bleeding. ",3
hot flashes were many and often. These got better after 9 months. new back pain not sure if it came form lupron or cancer. I wish there was another drug but options are limited. ,4
I just started using it about three weeks ago. Thus far I have had no ill effects.,4
"I'm 24 and was diagnosed with endo 5 years ago. 2 laps done and have been on the shot on and off for 3 years. Huge change in mestration, used to be heavy and painful and last for 2-3 weeks with 1-2 week break before I got my period again. Now I don't even get a period. I still get random pains by my hips but I'd rather deal with random pain opposed to everyday throbbing sharp pains. My side effects:Gained about 50 lbs in the last 3 years, somewhat moody, some joint pain on and off, hot flashes, very tired, bra size went up 2 full cup sizes. The side effect really suck but I'd rather have all of them opposed to being in pain and running out of blood from having such a long heavy period all the time. ",5
After a radical prostatectomy my PSA increased somewhat. My Dr said there maybe some stray cancer cells present. I took the 3 month injection 09/01/09 and my life has been pure misery since. I have been a paraplegic for 25 years and this medication robbed me of most of my muscle strength. The bone pain in areas where I had no sensation is getting unbearable. The pain has caused my changes in mood and interaction with friends and family. The worst problem has been the memory loss. It was real bad about 2 months after the injection. Has improved somewhat but still causing a lot of problems. These are causing a snowball effect with depression. My ability to sleep soundly has disappeared due to constant pain.,4
"I am 61 been on lupron 10 years psa starting to rise now but I have lived longer than expected and psa is still low at 0.21 but rising, still have hot flashes I had hoped my psa would stay undectable but it didn't.",5
"The first time I had a Lupron injection was back in 2003, before I had my surgery to remove fibroids. I had hot flashes, but it worked and I didn't have my period for three months prior to surgery. Now it's 2010 and I'm tired of the heavy periods that leave me tired and drained. I was given another Lupron injection ( thinking it would work like it did before )to stop my cycles until I had my hysterectomy. Nope, my cycle is right on schedule in-spite of the Lupron and the only saving grace is that I will have my surgery in several weeks. I have had heavy cycles for years ( most of my life )and I am no where near menopause at the age of 47. I'm disappointed that the Lupron injection didn't work this time, but people should keep in mind that that it might work and that it might not. Someone posted about having RA ( rheumatoid arthritis ) I don't know if the Lupron caused this, but I am also being treated for RA, which was diagnosed about 2 years ago. My mother had arthritis as well, so I really don't know if the RA is contributed to the Lupron or just genetics. I'm glad to hear that the injection is working for some and to the poor souls who don't have insurance to cover it....it is VERY expensive. I had a 20 dollar co-pay, but my insurance was billed over 2,000 dollars. I'm sure they adjusted the amount they paid, but it was still expensive non the less. ",1
i have been dealing with endometreosis for quite some time now i have been to d.s and tried all the birth control none of them helped im 26   years old and i have been thrown into medical medipause. i have had a laproscopic for the removal of cysts and then three months later i had a hysterectomy with 1/2 oophraectomy removal of 1 ovary but the pain was still there so my gyn put me on the shot with a hormone and i feel fine thank you depo luprona and hormone pill,4
"I was diagnosed with endometrosis and had laproscopy as well. They put me on the injection and also told me the side effects. I can not deal with the hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and not being able to get the adequate rest. I am also having some abdominal pain and nothing seems to help ease the pain except for BC Powder. I can't take many of those because it will eat away the lining of my stomach. The next time I go to the doctor, I'm just going to have to request for them to take out the tissue and my ovary, I can't keep living like this. It's a horrible feeling to have this continuously happen every night/day. ",3
"I choose Lupron over surgical removal of my ovaries, for now. This will shrink them and keep the estrogen away; breast cancer left me with concerned. All the side effects are TOUGH, yet managable. I always wasnted to be warm, and now, Boy! am I ever. None are severe enough to discourage me and thank God there was an option. I just put one foot in front of the other and get moving. Its good to know the side effects of hot flashes, chills, joint aches,and head aches may subside.",5
I suffered with endometriosis for 9 years and no birth control pills or medications ever helped with the pain. I would end up in the emergency room for stronger treatment all to end up with a high bill. I found a wonderful doctor who performed a laparoscapy with laser and removed the endometriosis. 1 month before surgery I started the Lupron shot and received 2 all together over 6 months. I did get hot flashes often but it's been a year since surgery and I have had no problems since. ,5
"I'm 5 years after lupron treating fibroid tumor . Menopause  at 42 years old.I'm now 48.My life is so bad.I can't use my hands,my legs an back hurt so bad the muscle on both sides of ribs are so tight I cry all the time.My husband  can't understand  all day long and half the night he has to rub my back and legs.I found out I have sugar last june.found out this week I have R A.We need to contact Senator's congressmen, and the President if we can..This drug need's taken off the market!To many of us with the same problems..WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG!!!",1
"Being treated for Stave IV metastatic breast cancer, peri-menopausal, receiving shots to decrease estrogen levels.  I have not had any problems with the shot itself.  Hot flashes and night sweats are expected and welcomed as good signs of decreasing estrogen, so the drug is doing it's job well!",4
"I was dianosed with endrometerios and i took this drug i took two shots and i really didnt feel much of the side effects except the heat falshes , yet it didnt stop my cycle there were days when i was heavy bleeding and others mild bleeding dont know if this is normal or not but it was not comfortable at all as now i just get bleeding with no pain and unexpected and have to wear pads every single day",3
"I took this drug for the dx of Stage IV Endo after surgery.  The drug did what it was suppose to, it stopped my cycles, therefore shutting off the estrogen for the endo to grow.  But, I contine to have severe pain along with the side effects: hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, insomnia, blurred vision, shortness of breath.  I also got dizzy from time to time right after the getting each shot.  The night sweats and hot flashes were the worst of the side effects.  I didn't sleep much from the night sweats and some of the time I would just wake up in the middle of the night for no reason wide awake and had trouble going back to sleep. I don't know if I would do it again or not.  The pain has improved a little with the combo of surgery and Lupron.  I had my last shot 12-28-09 and the side effects are still continuing.",2
i have stage 4 endo & the side effects not mentioned affected me terribly. look forward to chest pains & higher blood pressure on top of all the other stuff they do tell you. i do not agree this is for everyone b/c it is not a cure & you're realistically only should take it no longer than a year b/c of the damage it (lupron) does.,2
I use it for fibroid uterus and it has done everything it was suppos to do the price is very high I have to save in advance prior to my injections I feel so much better when I take the shot.,5
"After reading the reviews I did not want to take this drug. It took me months of speaking with my doctor and husband before I decided to go for it. I have endometriosis, i've had 2 laparoscopic surgeries in the last 3 years. Im taking Lupron Depot 11.25 mg injection + Add-back and I FEEL GREAT! I have no more pain. After several months I still haven't noticed any side effects, I am going about my life better than before.",5
I took the 3 month lupron twice. I got all the side effects i read about but the worst was how mad it made me all the time. I took my last shot of lupron in july and it is December now. I just now got my period. I took the lupron because my endometriosis made my periods unbearable. The period i just had was not near as painful as i rememebered my periods being so that must mean the lupron helped. I would recommend using lupron but only if completely necessary. It was ery hard to get through the past six months and not something i would want to do again. ,4
The headaches and bone aches are the worst. I am 17 and have felt like a 70 yr old woman. Im always tired and grouchy and i would  not reccomend this to anyone with an active lifestyle.,1
"This is my first time using lupron. I must admit that I do not like taking Meds. especially hormones. But I had no choice, my situation was dire! I bled profously each month and I was drained!! I'm close to the 3rd month of using Lupron and I'm ok. Thank God!!",4
"My side effects: hot flashes (of course), head aches, joint pain, hair loss (not sure if the shot is the cause but am not on any other meds) cramping, bloating, swelling, abdominal discomfort, super tired with out ability to sleep.   I am 28 years old have known about my endo for 10 years.  I tried many treatments and this was one of them.  I first took it in june of 2008 for 6 months. I got extremely depressed and had a hard time getting off the couch(lexipro helped) My period didnt stop and i had a ton of side effects swore i would never do it again.  in April of this year I had my 2nd lap and hystoscopy my endo had spread badly and the scar tissue from the first surgery fused my intestines to my abdominal wall so it had to be seporated. they told me because i had just been all cleaned out the shot would be more effective... the first 1 month shot i had my cycle, on the 3 month shot... first month i had cycle, 2nd month none all side effects increased, 3rd (this month) my cycle is back with a vengance... idk what to think or why i keep trying this stuff I guess I just realy realy want something anything to work.. but this doesnt, not for me.  I envy those of you who it has worked for but am happy for you.  ",1
This drug did not work! I was given a 3 month dose to shrink fibroids.  They did not shrink and I bled for 3 straight months!  I'm not sure why this drug was used; it is very expensive and did not work for me.  The only benefit was I did not have any negative side effects as reported by other users.,1
I used this drug for year because of constant pain with endometrios and fibroids.  I had 2 surgerys with in months of each other.  After the 2nd ssurgery I did the luperon for a year and I loved it.  I had hot flashes and nightsweats but that was so much better than the pain.  I was off of luperon for a year and I begged to be back on it again it was the only that has helped. I would take about 12-16 motrins a day and it did not even relieve the pain.  I have a cabniet full of pain pills half of them never knocked the pain.  I am now on the shot again and I could not be happier about it.,5
cant control the hot flashes sometime dissnes,4
no side effects,4
"I took this medication for a massive fibroid that had completely distorted my uterus and was larger than a grapefruit. The Lupron reduced the size of the tumor by 70% making laproscopic possible. I had one IM injection a month for 3 months...side effects were terrible but after having to get blood transfusions because of 45 day menstrual cycles it was all worth it. The side effects that I had included: hot flashes, nausea, insomnia (i slept for 16 hours total in 3 months), and muscle pain but after the meds stopped I started coming back to myself almost immediately however, i am still having some questionable nerve pain and pain from an enlarged liver? My Dr. made it clear from the beginning that this med would shock my body/mind into an instant menopausal state. Knowing this from the beginning helped to cope with the onset of the side effects. Even after all of the side effects, I would take this treatment again becaue of it's effectiveness. 45 day periods...lucky i'm not writing this from prison! Good Luck",5
"Lupron injection has helped shrink my 7 fibroids and decreased my excessive menstrual periods. Side effects I noticed were mild ie. mild joint discomfort at beginning of therapy, 2 episodes of nausea and vomiting toward end of therapy, and hot flashes throughout therapy to the point where I received a written reprimand one time on my job just before going to surgery for my hysterectomy.  After surgery my PCP put me on zoloft and catapress for the hotflashes.  I hope this helps because in this economy who can afford to lose a job.  All in all, I did experience a positive outcome which was to shrink the fibroids and decreased periods which in turn helped resolve my anemia. The benefit outweighed the risk, for me, as I am recooperating from my surgery.",4
"I am 35 years old and recently underwent laproscopic surgery to remove endometriosis scar tissue. My obgyn suggested the 3 month injection. I was very reluctant after reading some of the reviews. However, was told that since I was very active, I would probably not experience any of the symptoms. Since April, my quality of life has suffered tremendously. I experienced body aches and pain, hot flashes/night sweats, mood changes, depression and extreme fatigue! My three month treatment is over now and I have yet to start my cycle. My doctor has given me a boost of progesterone in hopes of reversing the drug. I cannot stress enough...please think twice before taking this drug. It has a horrible experience!",2
"I am 21 years old and have had 2 laps and have tried every bcp on the market! Although the side effects aren't always pleasant the lupron im injection has eliminated all of the pain...I have been on the injection for 6 months and taking the add-back therapy and the side effects I have expierenced are hot flashes(very frequent), minor muscle cramps and bone pain, along with occasional insomnia. Even though these suck at times I love not cramping and I am thrilled that this is helping cease the endrometriosis for the time being until my husband and I are ready to have children! I hope this helps and I believe that this is a move in the right direction for endometriosis therapy it just needs a little more perfecting!",5
"PLEASE READ THIS:   I have stage 2 endometriosis and had 2 Laparoscopies. I have growth on my uteris, blatter, ovaries, falopian tubes, basically all over. Lupron was like a last resort because of all the warnings against it. But no b.c's worked and my doc wouldnt precribe pain meds(I wish he could feel what I felt!)So after only the first couple months on Lupron, I've gone from being active and healthy- to now feeling like I have the body of an 80yr old. My back constantly hurts, my knees ache, I get hot flashes which is humiliating, and the most terrifying one is that I'm starting to have some short term memory loss. I'm only 23 and I feel like I ruined my life by taking this medicine. I'm stopping this med, I'd rather suffer and see what life has in store for me and try alternative methods of relief, than take another shot of that ever again! To those taking it, I hope you don't experience what I did; to those who are in similar situations, I wish you the best and I hope you feel better once off the drug. And just a strong caution to those considering taking this. I hope this helps atleast one person :)",2
"hot flashes, hands, and leg cramping. Took for fibroid shrinkage.Three month injection only, with no visible signs of period. Body feels like a train ran over it.Women with fibriods i suggest laparoscopic and hysterscopic myomectomy.Every night im throwing covers off and on.Antiflamatory medication good for aching pain.",3
I have bone pain and even after having a hysterectomy and receiving these injections my endometriosis has returned.,1
"I was given Lupron after having breast cancer to stop my body's production of estrogen.  The only side effects I have had are hot flashes & occasional night sweats, along with ending my periods. ",5
"I am a 38-year-old woman who for over five years was misdiagnosed by the many doctors.  My coworker referred me to her GYN in 2008.  In July 2008 I made an appt to see her.  Immediately just based on the symptoms my doctor diagnosed me with Endometriosis.  To confirm she ran all the necessary test.  She discussed with me my options, and I opted for a partial hysterectomy.  I already had three children and we were not having anymore.  Because of my workload it was done in December 2008.  Once I had my hysterectomy she gave me some options that would help prolong Endometriosis from returning.  She was upfront and honest regarding the side effects.  Her concern was that since I suffer from Migraines they would be induced.  She gave me a 1-month shot first.  I did get more headaches than usual but agreed to take the three-month dosage when the next shot was due.  In order to help with some of the side affects my doctor also prescribed Norethindrome Acet Tab 5MG Generic for Aygestin Tabs and this has really helped minimize the side affects.  Mood swings aren’t an issue because I am on Sarafem 10 mg.  Hope this helps ladies.     ",4
"I have never been so miserable>>I haven't slept more than 2 hours in a night in months..The hot flashes are horrible..My hands, hips and knees ache so badly I can't stand it..Which then has made me terribly depressed> My doctor has done nothing about this as he doesn't like to prescribe narcotics..But by God he hands out the anti-depressants...I will NOT take those!!! ",2
"This has been the worst time of my life. It is awful. Hot flashes,insomnia,night sweats,my face,hands,feet and ankles swelled up like balloons w/water retention and I gained 23 lbs. in 2 months and a total of 35 lbs. all together.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS MEDICATION!",1
I have gained weight been VERY tired the past 4 months on this medication.,3
I recently had a pelviscopy and my doctor found emdemetriosis on my left ovary and my uterus. I was supposed to start a 3 month round of lupron last week but am now very hesitant to. I was told that it would help with the endemetriosis but after reading the raviews I dont think I want to take it. As I already have headaches and you say the periods are worse after. Help! What should I do?,1
"I was diagnosed with endometriosis eight years ago and have had two laprosopic surgeries.  My doctor put me on this med after my last surgery (May 2008) for six months.  While my side effects weren't severe during my treatment (minimal mood swings, some problems sleeping, and some hot flashes), the side effects of this medicine are now hitting home.  My hips ache day and night, sometimes so unbearable that I can't move (and I'm only 23 years old).  I have major hot flashes several times a day and I still have symptoms of insomnia.  And, after all of that, my pain was reduced a little during treatment, but has since returned just as bad as it was before.  I have been off of Lupron for three months and still have not had a menstrual cycle.  ",2
"I have severe endometriosis, and this was my Drs last try at keeping me from getting a hysterectomy...as I have been trying to get pregnant for over a year.  The first 3 months on the shot I had the normal symptoms that I expected, i.e. hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, reduced sex drive...however, in the last 2 weeks...month 5 of being on the shot...I have had a massive headache for 13 days now that nothing can get rid of, I can sleep...ended up spending a few nights on the couch to try not to wake my husband up while I tossed and turned ALL NIGHT! My blood pressure sky rocketed and then went back down and back up again. Shortness of breath.  I have had severe neck, shoulder, and back pain...going to see a chiropractor tomorrow.  Pains in my hands, swelling of my hands...painful swelling.  Had I done a little more research and read a few more reviews before getting the shot, I never would have.  Yes, I have not had a single endometriosis pain in 5 months and that is fantastic, but from what I have read recently it seems as though they are only going to be worse once I stop the Lupron.  At this point I am a little disappointed that my Dr even prescribed such a nasty little drug!",3
"I am a 36year old women last year had surgery to remove fiborid tumor,my doc discoverd i had endometriosis so am now on 3month shot i just had my shot a few days ago the only side effects i had after the shot was  headaches,The following day i had some cramping but nothing else.It seemed to help me with not having Hot flashes,yet this is my first shot so will see what happens next month. My advice I drink plenty of fluids even when i feel like i dont want to get up i do, workout, do a little walking and things will be fine. Good luck! Ladies",5
"I had very minimal side effects from the medicine.  I was on it for 12 months for endo and have now been off it for 6 months.  I finally had my first period last week and it was worse than before.  On top of that, I went to the ER because the pain was so bad and they said i was pregnant.  Has anyone heard of this drug causing a false positive on a pregnancy test?",2
"brought my PSA, to .1 Hot flashes for 8 months - 12-20 a day",4
"Ladies i know how you feel about the side effects of the shot. I have endometriosis, the doc used this as my first treatment after my surgery. It helped a little while i was getting the shot. The side effects of this was worst for me then the pain of the endo. I am almost out of options to do to help with the pain. my boyfriend left me because he can't deal with the emotional roller coaster that i have been on. so if there is any one that has suggestions please i am begging you help me. i have been on 4 different medications. i am desperate, i don't want a hysterectomy yet i am only 33.

It knocked mt PSA reading down from 900 to point 4 in a matter of a couple of months. Along with Casadex 50mg,5
"I have been on this drug for 9 months now. The doctor says I'm getting no better but I am getting no worse. The lack of energy, hot flashes, and chills are really bad at times.",4
"I recently had a laprascopy and a d&c due to having severe endometriosis. I just had the Lupron shot on Friday. I am already having muscle spasms, battling sleep, chills, sweats, etc....I was recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia earlier this year and with the shot, I feel like this is bringing all of the fibro symptons back! I finally had that under control until I started having major cramping and bleeding (even though I was on the pill). I want to go ahead with the hysterectomy, but due to my age, I have to go through this first. After all that I have reasearched on several websites, I will not due another shot. This one is a 3 month, so I am not sure how the next few months will be. I am ready to get through this and get better. I have 2 kids and would rather have the hysterectomy and get back to feeling ""normal"". I am still having a lot of pain and it's very difficult to have my dr understand that I am not seeking pain pills, just want something to help make me comfortable and get through work and try to spend time with my family without complaining of how much pain I am in. Giving birth to my kids was not as bad as this! Please do all the research you can and stick to your guns if you don't want to take it! Make your doctor listen! ",1
"I've had endo for over 15 years/ 3 laperoscopies- I would say a severe case. I have been on long term pain mngmnt for it as well just to function at my job. It took my doc almost a year to convince me on this shot. I admit it did what it was intended to do. I only did the 3 month shot - which should've worn off in the last 2 wks or so. I'm back on Lybrel - year round BCP now - due to the shot side effects. I have a new found side effect for menopausal women who don't have the choice to stop side effects. The name ""hot flash"" doesn't do it justice. Feeling your being microwaved from the inside out and not knowing how long it will last - excruciating! It can't be good for your body to have such dramatic constant body temp spikes. It's like you can't regulate your temp. After reading your stories I am now able to link the other side effects - swelling, migraines as I am weaning off, mood swings/less sex drive. Anxiety for sure - If your taking this to treat long term endo - I'm sure you agree it's worth it if done short term to stop the pain & bleeding, not to mention the literal damage you do to your femal organs EVERY time you cycle. I use to think after I have kids I want a hysterectomy so I don't have to deal w/ endo nemore. I now know that I will do whatever it takes to supress my cycles and keep my plumbing as long as possible so that I don't have these hot flashes!! Your stories have helped me immensely and I hope my story will someone also. Hang in there - keep in mind why your on it, and know that (for the most part) your doc is doing this because the side effects beneficially outweigh the condition for your overall health and well being. Good luck to all :) ",5
"I was bing treated for endometreosis. I was put on lupron for a year. When initially put on the shot, i did experience the hormone spike. Then the drop. Mood swing and alot of hot flashes.  I am satisfied with the fact that I wasn't in pain during the treatment, no sharp endo pains, severe cramping or painful intercourse. However I have been off treatment for 3 months now and I am already having some pains again. I have been put on the pill for those 3 months. I have had cramps every period, and through the entire period. This last time the cramps have continued for 5 days after my period was over. I do know there is no cure and that the endo will always come back, but I was hoping it would be a little longer.",5
"Mild depression,night sweats,lack of energey and low labito.",4
"My ob-gyn gave me the shot to stop my period. I took the one for 3 months, 11.25 mg. It did nothing for me but trouble : Headaches, no sleeping, cramps, over emotional, mood swings, hot flashes. I just couldn't take all the side effects. I was so tired all the time, weak in my arms. I felt like a 80 yr old women w/ mood swing out of control. I had a break down for no reason at all. I don't think anyone should take this shot. The horror of the exerience is worse than medcations I have ever had to try & help me. ",1
"My doctor recommended this drug as a treatment for my numerous fibroids and prolonged/extremely heavy, painful periods (I had been having a light,constant flow for 6 months interspersed with weeks of heavy, painful flow).  I was very hesitant to try this drug after reading the reviews on this site. But I decided I could not continue on living the way I was and went for it.  I could not be happier! After two weeks, my period FINALLY stopped.  It has been a month and a half since my 1st injection and the only side-effect I've had is occasional, mild hot flashes.",5
"For years I had excruciating menstrual pain. Late last year I was told I have endometriosis. I had a laparoscopy early February but to my surprise I still had horrible pain. My OBGYN suggested lupron. I am always tired, moody, super sensitive, extra emotional, become depressed at times, have constant headaches, experience hot flashes day and night constantly (to the point of no sleep!), gained weight and sex drive is gone! The pill given to reduce side effects only effects hot flashes. DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG. Do your research and you will find may articles about the long term effects and the may lawsuits filed against this drug.",5
"Yes I have hot flashes and night sweats where I wake up soaked, but it is nothing compaired to the horrible cramping and pain I had before I went on this.  I was diagnosed with adenomyosis and was in so much pain that I couldn't work.  I am only 24 and didn't want to have a hysterectomy, other than living with the pain, this medication was my only choice.  I hardly have any pain at all anymore.  It has really helped me.",5
The hot flashes are sometimes unbearable. I enjoy not having a monthly cycle. My blood iron levels have gotten better since I started with the injection.,3
"Thanks to all previous reviewers-it's not just me!  I took 3 months of injections to slow my extremely heavy periods and to shrink numerous large fibroid tumors.  This treatment was an option given to me since my doctor would not give me a hysterectomy while on blood thinners.  I have experienced those overwhelming hot flashes (where you're burning up from the inside out), night sweats/chills (causing insomnia and extreme fatique), unbelieveable pain and swelling in the hands, arms, legs, ankles and soles of feet that I walk like an 90 yr old, huge mood swings and deep depression.  I experienced unexpected bleeding since the lst shot in June and had to settle for wearing feminine hygiene products every day since as a precaution.  I would not recommend that women take this medication (which is used to treat advanced prostate cancer in men) to treat ""other"" coditions due to the side effects.  It's too late for me, but maybe someone else will benefit from this information.  I now have to suffer through the upcoming months wondering when my cycle will suddenly come back, while continuing to wear precautionary pads to avert another embarrassing moment.   ",3
"hot flashes, body aches, sweats",5
"I took a one month shot and followed with a 3 month shot for a fibroid with very heavy bleeding. I wish I hadn't. I now have severe muscle weakness, pain all over, especially in hands, feet, legs. I'm only 52 but feel like 80 when trying to move. Doctors don't seem to know anything. They don't want to admit it's from the lupron, but it came on as soon as I took the 3 month shot.",5
"ALMOST IMMEDIATELY REDUCED MY PSA TO UNDER 0.5.  tHIS, AFTER SURGERY AND RADIATION FOR PROSTATE CANCER.",5
"I am only 19 and have been on lupron depot for 6 months, at first my experience was horrible. My dotor wanted to say my problems were just muscle spasms. But i decided to have the surgey anyway. What do you know I have endometriosis. he prescribed me lupron without giving me anything to help out with the hot flashes. I was extremley emotional, couldnt sleep, severe mood swings and hot flashes. so found a new doctor he prescribed me medication to take with it. And I feel great. Besides feeling tired all the time",4
"The side effects can be rough in the beginning, but there are ways to help. Add back therapy has worked wonders for me :) Hot and cold flashes are very slim and other side effects are nonexistant. I highly recommend this drug to anyone who is suffering from endometriosis! I am only 25 and have been living with endometriosis for 10 years, and believe me the shot is worth it! Before Lupron I had 5 laproscopic surgeries for cyst removal, and 1 surgery that resulted in the loss of an ovary, tube, and 25% of my colon.. So, to me its absolutely worth it. But, talk to your doctor about ALL SIDE EFFECTS and PRECAUTIONS while on this drug. My doctor and I discussed Lupron for months before I made my decision. And too often, we let our doctors give us drugs that we don't know what they are for and how to properly use them. Do not be this way about just Lupron, use common sense everytime they write you a prescription! And do research as well. A lot of people on here blame their doctors when the only real person they can blame is themself.",5
"I have been on Lupron for 4 mths now.  My pain is gone my period is gone, I don't mind the flashes, but I am extremely tired and do not sleep well.  I do have muscle pain in my leg. Very annoying, especially when trying to sleep. ",4
"I had moderate endometriosis and my highly recommended gyn told me to take Lupron to ""burn out the endo"". She did not warn me about the side effects,however gave me a packet of info which I read.When I went back to get 1st shot she minimized my anxiety and assured me this was great!! I was supposed to have 6 shots but stopped after 3 mos(shots). I now have extreme fatigue,depression, and have now been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I would not have blamed the drug had I not read about all the possible side effects in another book about endometriosis. It recommend getting a bone scan after treatment with Lupron and told a story of a 20-ish woman with the bones of a 60 yr old.And that was the tip of the side effect iceberg!!The big problem with Lupron for endo is that there are not enough docs who care enough to find the disease in a laparoscopy so they do the drug route to save themselves time.If you have endo read from the endo organizations sites and learn about your options and the few true endo experts before making any decision. I would rather give myself a hysterectomy than touch Lupron again!!",1
"I started Lupron therapy in April for my impending myomectomy this July and the first and 2nd months were hell. Lost of hot flashes, then came the cold flashes/chills and the night sweats. The first month there was injection site pain, headaches. Fatigue has continued as I was severely anemic.Anemia has gotten better as I haven't had a cycle since January but now in the third month I seem to experiencing an actual period even though I am on both Lupron AND an oral hormone with estrogen because my Doc says lupron can cause bone loss as it has no estrogen in it.. Yeah I'm all screwed up!  Anyway, I was wonderin gif anyone has experienced hairloss. I believe I am and it's not due to low iron because I am PUMPED up on that stuff! I think Lupron has a lot of good and bad things associated with it. I'll be glad when the whole ordeal is over....",3
I HAD MY FIRST SHOT ALMOST A MONTH AGO. MY DOCTER GAVE ME A ONE MONTH DOES TO SEE HOW I WILL REACT TO IT BEFOR SHE GIVES ME THE THREE MONTH SHOT.MY MAIN SIDE AFFECT OF COURS HOT FLASHES!!! AND IM SOOO TIRED ALL THE TIME I SLEEP 12 HOURS A DAY AND STILL HAVE TO DRAG MYSELF OUT OF BED. ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROB? PLEASE TELL ME ITS NOT JUST ME. IM ONLY 24 AND HAVE ENDO!! BUT THANK GOD THE PAIN IS GONE...PLEASE TELL ME THEIRS NOT MORE TO COME.,5
"5 years later I am almost completely disabled from Lupron, It has ruined my life. I was better off having endo. I now have chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, insomnia, muscle tremors and weakness, daily headaches, digestion problems,back pain, chest pain, etc. I am not the only one also. Go to yahoo forums and look at ""victims of lupron"" there are many women reporting long term side effects after using this drug. This drug was never meant for women. It was designed to treat prostate cancer in men. I wish I had known before as I never would have taken it. I ended up having to have a hysterectomy anyway. I wish the Dr.s would have listened to me back then and allowed me to have the surgery instead of trying Lupron. It is pure poison!!",1
I have had head-akes alot but this medication has helped with my endometosis.,5
I had my first lupron injection for prostate cancer in February. 2 1/2 months later im having hot flashes constantly. I still have energy to do most active activities. but my sexual feelings have declined. Im also getting radiation treatments.,3
"I just had my second 3 month shot of lupron and it has really helped all of my symptoms of severe bleeding, clotting and cramping. I haven't had a cycle since starting this and I haven't had to miss any days of work due my cycle problem since. The only symptom I am having is alternating between severe hot flashes and cold flashes. They both last for hours at a time. Neither my Gyno or my family doctor advised me about any of the side effects so I was totally unprepared. I can honestly say Lupron has really helped me out. The hot and cold flashes only lasted for 2-3 weeks lsat time so I am hoping for the same this time. ",4
"I was diagnosed with endometriosis 5 years ago. After several doctors and two laperscopies to burn off the endo, there was still no relief. In fact, it got worse. I am just coming off of the lupron after a year. My pain went completely away and I was prepared for the side effects thanks to by doctor. Hot flashes and low sex drive were my biggest problems. Surprisingly, it did wonders for my anxiety and depression. I'm a MUCH happier person on Lupron than off. In coming off the Lupron, I have sever mood swings, cry for no reason. I am not looking forward to getting my period back.",5
I had the lupron shot in January and for the first two weeks my pelvic pain was more sever then before. After that the pelvic pain totally disappeared but then every joint in my body began to swell and ache and most days it is hard to get up out of bed let alone chase after my 19month old son. I am swollen and achy all the time and my mood has changed so much I snap at everything and fatigue is bad. I don't think I will take my next shot in a week. Will the swelling and aching joints go away?? if you ezperienced this please email me at [email protected] (oh also my calcium is way low now and i have to take a supplement everyday.,3
"My urologist d/ced its use. My question is: how long will the ""hot flashes"" continue? Am unable to find an answer to this. ",5
"This medicine does have side effects that i believe decrease over time; none severe enough for me to discourage use. I have found relief from every symptom of fibroids and severe anemia... although I am almost sure the relief is too temporary. I believe that some of my symptoms were hotflashes, interrupted sleep- continues, fatigue, irritability... but the me before this shot was just tired of whay i had to go through each and every day. Comparing symptoms of the fibroids and the lupron... the shot is more tolerable",3
"I previously posted that I had the first shot in October, and now, almost 6 months later, still no period.  I am beginning my next round of hormones to try to start my period.

"I am 25. I was diagnosed with moderate/severe endrometreosis after undergoing exploratory surgery for my abdominal pain. I have been using Lupron for about 7 months. I do have excessive hot flashes, mood swings, and lowered sex drive, just like during menopause. I was prepared for all the side effects because of my doctor. And I would have to say that the temporary side effects are better for me than what I was experiencing (the sudden crippling pain,  pain during sex, and worst of all the possibilty that I might not be able to have children.) I am however looking forward to when the hot flashes, mood swings, and lowered sex drive will stop, and I am sure my husband is as well.",4
Have had many injections to slow prostate cancer,3
"I used this medication for endometriosis.  I just got the first shot two days ago, and I already know that I will not get the second one.  The pain I was living with before is way better than the side effects I am going through now.  Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, muscle pain.  I feel like every muscle in my body is tearing itself apart and somebody is stabbing me in the chest.  I called my dr office and so far, no response.  It seems to me like these are some of the side effects they dont tell you about before you get the shot.",3
"I was diagnosed with endometriosis and began the depot lupron injections in late June and the last injection ""wore off"" late december. It is now beginning of March, and I have still not had a cycle. I still suffer from severe hot flashes, and pelvic pain. This medication has been a nightmare. My knees are sore, my tibia (shin bone) is extremely sore. does anyone else have delayed menstrual cycles?

"I've never been so hot in my life.  The hot flashes are downright overwhelming!  When the hot flashes start, I get weak and light-headed, my pulse starts racing and I feel like I'm being smothered. I find it hard to concentrate at work because of the constant onset of the hot flashes. I'm not sleeping well because I'm so hot.  I keep on of those gel ice paks on my night stand and usually wake up in the morning with it on my chest.  Sadly though, by the time morning comes, the ice pak is no longer cold; it's usually warm to the touch because I'd used it during the course of the night.  I also purchased a 'chill pillow' via the internet.  I put that one under my pillow or between my mattress and my memory foam topper.  It helps when I'm falling asleep, but has the same effect as the chill pillow...by the time I wake up, it's warm to the touch.  No more periods though...so far, so that's good.  And my fibroids are shrinking so I'm not as uncomfortable in the abdomen area as I was when I started the treatment.  GOOD LUCK LADIES!",4
"My doctor warned me before I took the shot that it would feel like I was in menopause, so he prepared me for it better than what some seem to have been (from reading their posts)  However, It's been 5 months since my last injection and I still have not had any cycles yet.  Just lots of hot flashes and mood swings.  Has any one else not gotten there period back after taking this shot?  And for those that did, how long does it take?  I was assured by my doctor that I would definately start cycling again, but am becoming very worried. . . .  ",4
"This medication had horrible side effects. The hot flashes are very uncomfortable. Also my muscles, joints, and bones have been horribly effected, to the point where I am on long term pain medications. I am also having to limit my physical activites, like having a good work - out at the gym. My last work out session caused me to get a sprain in my general shoulder area, this has happened twice.

"I took this and had severe side effects, mood swings, depression, bleeding off and on with heavy cramping. Severe chest pain too. Also had severe acne. Never had any acne in my life.Told Dr. of problems and she just blew them off. Said I had to continue with the full 6 month treatment. Had last shot in Dec. Full blown period 2 weeks later with the most severe cramping I've ever had.Also having severe depression and thoughts of sucide. Would absolutly not recommend this to anyone. Worst mistake I ever made. Please stay away from this medication.",1
"I took one dose of Lupron for endometriosis, and it not only excaserbated my condition, but severely messed up my mood. I had a mildly heavy period for the whole three months, horrible cramps (worse than when I was off it), and it relapsed my depression. I told my doctor I had mood issues, and he assured me Lupron would not affect my mood. Boy was he wrong: I fell into one of my deepest depressions to date, becoming listless, hopeless, and suicidal--I almost got hospitalized twice while on it. Three days after my dose wore off and I switched to a new medication, my period and cramps stopped (well, mostly) and my depression cleared. IF YOU HAVE ANY HISTORY OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TAKING LUPRON!!!",1
"It's great not having a cycle but the flashes, mood swings, sweating is fierce.  Use cautiously.",3

"There are side effects that you should discuss with doctor. For prostate treatment, I understand ""flare"" can be reduced be preceding treatment with Casodex. I had pain around site of 2nd injection, which went away after a few days. Fatigue is main side effect now.",5
"The first few days I had very severe bone pain and my dr. said she had never heard of that as a side effect.  After I got past that, I've had minimal problems.  I do have to take a hormone pill every day so I don't have hot flashes and mood swings, so I haven't experienced any of that at all.  I only had the injection a month ago.",4

"I have severe endometriosis and had two shots of the lupron.  It worked for the pelvic pain well enough after the first shot.  I had lots of hot flashes and mood swings.

"Taking 112 capsules a week is amazing. But it made me feel much better than before. My CA decreased. The only thing is that the price is too much expensive.

my elderly father has been taking Megestrol because of drastic weight loss. It seemed to work well at first. He gained 14.5 lbs in 1 month. In the last 7 weeks he has lost all the weight he has gained and then some. At first he was hungry all the time. Now he is back to no appetite. The only thing that has changed is that he was getting the Mgestrol from the local pharmacy and now he is getting  Megestrol Acetate from the VA. Can the different generic be less effective for some people? ,3

"Jane, megace (megestrol acetate) is a high strength progestin. so basically it's nothing more than a hormone.  If she is haing problems with the drug you might consider a lower dosage.  Diarrhea is not actually a sign of allergic reaction with this drug it is simply a side effect.  if it becomes too much of a problem you might want to look into changing medications but before you do anything drastic try lowering the dosage or maybe taking some imodium with it as needed.  if you do decide to take her off the drug be sure you do not stop it abbruptly the side effects from the drastic hormone change could be VERY uncomfortable!  Hope this helped.",5

In 2006 I was put on Remicade and it worked wonders and put me in remission, but I had to stop the infusions in 2009 so that I could have a bowel resection surgery. Once stopped, you cannot start it again due to a high chance of an allergic reaction. So my GI put me on 6MP. I was on 150mg a day at first, but now I am down to 75mg a day.

Also on endicort, no side effects so far. I don't agree with infusions, long term, I know people with luekemia they got from years of infusions.  No one knows long term problems on these infusions.

"I've been dealing with epidermolysis bullosa for nearly 30 years.  I've taking prednisone periodically over this time.  Most of those years, I skipped the prednisone, but over the past 3 years, breathing is a real issue due to mucus.  I have a trach that i think was brought on by numerous episodes of acid-reflux, and having a trach allows for my airway to dry out,  resulting in dysphagia.  I finally gave in and began taking 10mgs of prednisone, and for the first time in years, i wasn't afraid to sleep.  my doctor felt that i needed to reduce my use of prednisone, so mercapturine 50mgs was started along with the prednisone.  after six days of this, my lose teeth were damn near killing me.  it took 2 days of not taking the the mercapturine, before the pain from my teeth subsided.  my teeth are loose because of my epidermylysis bullosa.

"I was put on 6MP in the hospital about six years ago, within days of being diagnosed with Crohn's. This was my first hospital stay, so I was already a bit apprehensive. The nurse walking in gloved, carrying a tiny bottle - sealed and labeled ""CAUTION: CHEMOTHERAPY"" - did not really help matters. I was extremely hesitant to swallow something that no one else would even touch, but I was sick and desperate enough to try anything that might make me feel better. So I took it. And took it again the next day. And again. I was on a Prednisone high at that point, happily able to function ""normally"" again, but my doctor said that it would take a while to kick in, but it would help keep me well once I was off the steroids, and I believed him. Over the next four years, I suppose it might have been helping... maybe. It's hard to say, really, looking back. I definitely was better than I was in the hospital or before treatment, but I didn't really have the energy to spend too long on my feet doing much of anything. At the time, I just took it with a grimace that the fatigue was just part of being chronically ill. But some more serious symptoms did flare up every now and then - maybe once or twice a year. I was given Prednisone and Entocort in such cases, and the symptoms quickly went away, so I thought little of them - until they returned, of course. And then, after four years, within the span of about a month, without any visible bleeding, my red blood cell counts depleted... to the point of me needing to be hospitalized and given three blood transfusions. No one really wanted to say that it was the 6MP, but my doctors never really told me anything else conclusive about what happened. After that hospital stay, I was switched from 6MP to Remicade treatments. Comparatively, since the switch, I have had virtually no symptoms and have at least five times the energy I had on 6MP. I'm sure 6MP works for some people, but it does have its risks, and it just didn't work out for me.",2

"I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2006, started on prednisone, then moved on to 6mp. Over the years I felt this medicine has helped and also hurt me. I get several infections each year, have lost a lot of my hair several times, and have passed 4 kidney stones. I should mention I am a vegetarian and eat extremely healthy. I got pregnant while taking this medication and was told to stay on the medicine by my GI--- I had a devastating late term miscarriage (18 weeks). Of course I was told it was not the medicine. I am trying to heal naturally and have been on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for 6 months now. I have had major improvements and am hopeful to get off the 6mp soon and try to have another baby. This medicine may work for some people, but it has caused more pain then help for me. I think it is a harsh medicine and no one should take it while being pregnant. I am trying to find a GI doctor that will help me treat my Crohn's with diet and vitamins--with no luck so far. I am researching D.O.'s versus M.D's to successfully get off the 6mp. I hope it will work!      ",2
This med works pretty good. i have put weight on for the frist time in years.,5
"Avoid it if you can! Though Mercaptopurine (6mp) is primarily a cancer chemotherapy, I was being treated for IBD with this drug in years 1999-2000, for approximately 3 months.  At the time it was widely believed to be a potentially effective therapy for IBD.  I am uncertain of its current medical status in this regard. However, having no other primary causation, I contracted sever liver cirrhosis which effects me in exceptionally negative ways.  Later, I was a cancer patient and the cirrhosis compromised my cancer treatment.  I have been diagnosed with ""cryptogenic cirrhosis"" (unknown or mysterious origin) though I strongly suspect the 6mp to be the primary causal factor. It's very powerful chemotherapy in some cases, but similarly has potentially very strong side effects. If you are predisposed to liver problems, you certainly do not want to use this drug if you can avoid it. Likewise, even if you do not have liver issues, I would try to avoid it in favor of alternatives with similar or better records of effectiveness.  The significance of severe liver disease as a possible side effect of 6mp is a high life-threatening and/or life-shortening risk, not to mention severe reductions in quality of the remainder of life.",1

If this doesn't work then I may have to have my rectum removed and use a bag.  I really hope the flare up doesn't return.  I am exhausted and work a 45 hr/ week job with a 7 years old.

I have been on it for 8 months, and I have not seen the side affects that I heard about, thank God!! My goal is to continue my meds and the Single Carbohydrate Diet by Elaine Gottschall.  I am a nervous person and have begun relaxation techniques and maybe I can then be weaned off the meds and stay on the diet for another year and then gradually try introducing grains again.  The diet is not easy to stay on.",5
I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 3 years ago ever since than I was put on prednisone (steroid) to keep my severe flare  ups under control. I had 3 difrent gi doctors to take me off the steroids because I couldn't find the right medication To work for me other than steroid. So finally I was put on 6 mp 6 months ago100 mg per day.  and I have been doing well on it with no side effect or flare ups.So my doctor recommend I stay taking it for the rest of my life.  But my Maine concern is what should I expect from this medication if I stay on it for the  rest if my life? Anyone has the same recommendation ?   ,4
Responding to the previous reviewer--my daughter took both 6MP and warfarin for about 8 months.  She had a clot and was on warfarin for a few months.  Her IBD worsened and couldn't be controlled with any other drugs we tried.  Once on 6MP she got much better.  She never has any bad interactions between the 6MP and the warfarin.  Her doctors monitored her warfarin carefully--she went for weekly bloodwork the entire time she was on warfarin (almost a year).  I hope you're doing better!,5
"I just started this drug and am very concerned with the drug interactions- my doctor and pharm, both said I can mix it with warfarin, but im not so sure, after 2 days of use I now have a blood clot in my leg, not sure what to think- any one else mixing WITH BLOOD THINNERS??",3
ulcerative colitis,3
"After 2 weeks of taking this medicine, I became very nauseated all the time.  That is the only side effect I've had, but it's enough to make me stop taking it. ",2
"I have been taking this medication since being diagnosed with Crohns 5 years ago.  Have had very little to no side effects, but recently have had an increase in upper respiratory infections.  Wondering if any others are suffering increase illness?",4
"I have had Crohnes for about 10 years.  When this drug was only available as a name brand (purenthol,) it was much better.  The generics are inconsistent in the relief they give.  Even though they are supposed to be the same.  I am tempted to pay the difference and forget about the insurance.",3
"I have been taking this drug (50 mg) for 6 years right after a serious flare that landed me in. I have never had any serious side effects. I also take Asacol 3 times a day(started with 4 tablets per dose, and now down to three). I got pregnant and continued both treatments. I was monitored closely and delivered a healthy baby via c-section. No breast feeding, but thankful for the healthy baby. I did not experience a flare after the pregnancy. This drug has kept me from being dependent on prednisone.",5
"Ive been using this drug for 10 monthes with little improvement and alot of side effects.I started at 50mg ,then was upped to 75mg.I cant go up any futher than that cuz my blood counts and liver enzymes go crazy.Ive expercienced nausea,hair loss,sinus infections,itchy skin,fever,chills,body aches and inflamation,its not showing results after ten monthes so we are gonna try Humira",3
"I have Crohn's.  Taken this med on/off for over 1 year.  No side effects noticed.  Some lower back issues but didn't believe related.  Female reviews indicate hair loss, not for me.  Try it.  Better yet, heathly diet (reduce lettuce, increase tomato), reduce stress, and hope your dr. is good (I had issues with dr ignoring and making illness worse).",5
"Have had UC for 30 years.  A few years ago 5-ASA failed to resolve my flares.  Tried Prednisone twice.  Worked on UC, but side effect of hyperglycemia made continued use impossible.  Have been on 6MP for 9 months.  Works fine on UC.  Found I had to change my diet somewhat as the 6MP seems to have made me less tolerant of some foods, but I can live with that.  Worst side effect, if it is one, is middle back pain from area of just above left kidney to slightly higher on right.  Came on after 3 weeks of 6MP use.  Despite various tests and imaging no one can diagnose anything else wrong, but the literature on 6MP doesn't have show that kind of pain associated with it.  Will risk going off for 6 months soon to see if that resolves the back pain.  Hope your experience is better than mine.",4
This medication worked well for me until blood tests indicated that it was effecting my liver. I also experienced skin rashes/inflamation and wonder if anyone else has had this experience?,4
Taking 50mg daily for autoimmune hepatitis. Started out along with 40mg prednisone but have been off prednisone since May. Mild elevation of liver enzymes but so far no decrease in white cell count. Sometimes fatigued but it usually doesn't last longer than a day or two at a time. Occasional hot flashes. Slightly more bruising then usual. No hair loss. Some joint stiffness/weakness but that may be associated with unknown connective tissue disease.,3
"My 5 year old granddaughter has been on this medication for aproximately 18 months, in conjunction with Sulfasalazine and has had very welcome results with little or no side effects.",5
"I've only been on this medication for 6 weeks. I've noticed a great improvement. I only have one  problem, hair loss. Anyone have any ideas as to how I can reverse this and still take the med?",4
"I had been taking asocal but i had to take so many every 4 hours! Now i take 1 1/2 a day. Its better for me cause one dose im done for the day, with having children you are contuniously doing things, and having to remember things. This i dont have to remember if i took it or not!",5
"Have had IBD for more than 37 years. Until I started mercaptopurine(about 8 years now), I suffered severe and long term flare ups. It took quite awhile, but once this medication quicked in, my symptoms have been very mild at worst. One treatment worth considering! ",5
"I've been on almost everything:  prednisone (works wonder, but horrible side effects including moon face, acne, bad temper/mood, and longer-term consequences -- was on 60mg at one point), prevacid/protonix couple with sucralfate (more to protect the upper track + stomach), cyclonesporin (used when hospitalized; very effective when taken with prednisone; serious side effects as well), Humira (injections, worked first 3 weeks, ineffective afterwards), Levaquin/Flagyl/Cirpo (antibiotics), probiotics, Lialda (mesalamine; very effective but unfortunately i was one of the unlucky few that developed pancreatitis -- fevers, back spasms/aches, trouble breathing -- worst feeling ever), Remicade (IV drip every once a month; very annoying and costly, worked for a good month then flared up again), eastern medication (tried this as well, herb stuff for good 2-3 months), no carbs diet or no veggie/fruits diet (not disciplined enough), and lastly 6mp.  Now, about 6mp:  I'm currently on 100mg (2 tablets); it prevented the flare-ups but after 3 months of being on it, i developed a bad side effect of nausea.  I would gag at least 20+ times every morning, couple times right before lunch, and a few more at nights.  I've tried changing the schedule of dosage: instead 2 tablets every morning (with and without foods) to every evening to 1 tablet each morning/evening, and to even half tablet each morning/evening, but nothing seem to be working. After stopping for a good 2-3 weeks, I flared up again! Now I'm on hydrocortisone enemas + 6mp again... hopefully soon enough I can taper off the steroids enemas and stay w/ the 6mp.  I'm gagging again... this is intolerable and I might once again stop the 6mp just to experience another flare-up.  the cycle continues... sigh!",4
"i have had crohn's for 6 years. starting getting steriod damage from prednisone. doc put me on mercap starting w 50mg does. increased to 100 mg to get off prednisone. was fine but now having flair ups again, sinus's infected, and may have to start steriods again. ",5
"Ive been taking this drug for 6 monthes.The first few monthes was only on 50mg.After carefully watching my blood counts she upped me to 75mg.Im seeing dramaic improvement now.The thing thats sucks tho,hair loss.Ever since i went on a higher dosage im seeing alot of hair loss,my hair is thinning.Also reoccuring sinus infections.But my UC symtoms are getting under control.",4
"I have had ulcerative colitis for 20 yrs. Painful and tiring days are now replaced with happy painfree energetic days. My prayers were answered with only 1 slight side effect, minimal hair loss.",5
I have been on MP6 for 6 month (lots of hair loss).  So far unable to wean off the Prednisone. The longest I've been off the steroid was a month & then my UC flaired again so I'm back on it (lots of side effects).  Unable to say if the MP6 actually working!!! ,3
"My husband was diagnosed with Crohns in 2004 and other meds were tried with no success. He began 6MP in 2005 and for awhile it seemed to work. Last year he became worse; severe abdominal pains, painful urination, vomiting, diarrhea. His dr. stopped the 6MP, but the symptoms continue..blood cell count out of wack, he has lost 50 lbs and stays weak. They are running tests to determine what illness/condition he has. Maybe his pancreas? Of course, I can't prove the 6MP caused this, but with all the research I've done recently about the long term side-effects of this medication it's hard not to think there is some connection.",2
My 11 year old son has been taking 50 mg 6 mp for more than 2 1/2 years for acute lymphocytic leukemia Right now his dose is 2 1/2 tab. 4 days a week and 2 tab. 3 days a week.  He has not had any known side effects from this medication so far and the leukemia has stayed in remission. ,4
I am taking 100mg 6mp for autoimmune hepatitis. I also take 5mg prednisone. I have had one flare up in the last 3 months. That is when the Dr. increased the 6mp from 50 to 100.  I have had no hair loss and no other side affects in 10 months of usage. Azathiopine was the drug of choice but I became violenly ill after 30 days od taking it.  What work for some does not work for others.,4
I have had UC for over 15 years and was in remission until last year when I had a very bad flare up. The only thing that was working for me was Prednisone and Colazal. Every time I was weaned off the Prednisone I would flare again. My Doctor told me that I should try Mercaptopurine and that most people tolerated it very well. I have had few side effects (hair loss and tiredness) but it beats the UC symptoms! I have lost urgency and cramping. I gained weight and feel great compared to last year at this time! I am on 100mg of it at the recommendation of my Doctor. ,5
11 year old son being treated with 6MP for Crohn's Disease. MY only concern so far is mild elevated liver enzymes when his blood work was done. Not sure what this means.,3
I have had Crohn's disease for 5.5 years now(since I was 18) and this medicine has been the only pill that has worked for me (I've been taking it for about 4.5 years). I went 4 years before I had even the slightest recurrence of the crohns pain/symptoms. The only side effect that I experience is extreme sensitivity to the sun- If I'm out in the sun for more than 2 hrs I break out in rashes/severe sun poisoning and I never had this problem before I started on this medication. Otherwise this drug has been extremely effective in controlling all of my symptoms. However I did read that this drug can cause gallstones and I did in fact have my gallbladder removed about a year ago- but I would rather go through one painless/quick surgery then live a lifetime of pain from the crohns. ,5
"I have been on 6-MP for close to 2 years now to treat my UC. Starting at 50mg and now at 100mg. So far I haven't seen any major side-effects other than thinning hair, bruises very slow to go away, and fatigue.  Although I was only diagnosed with UC a little over 2 years ago so it's hard to tell what's the UC and what's drug side-effects. I'm also taking several other meds so it's hard to say.  I've since been diagonosed with gastritis recently due to all my meds. My concerns however are more the long term use, which there seems to be little research on. At this point I have tried once to cut my dose to try and ultimately stop the drug.  This just caused my UC to flare so I had to start Predisone again and raise the dose back up.  I just think that before starting this drug people should be informed about how long term you will have to be on it, possibly forever.  I also didn't know until recently when I changed DR.'s that there is a blood test that can tell you if the dossage of 6-mp is right for you.",4
"I have had UC for over 15 years with flare-ups every 3 or 4 months, some that lastest 6 weeks.  My choice was colon removal or living with it.  I went to Mayo's in Jacksonville where my GE tried to talk me into 6-MP for two years.    Finally I agreed.  Now no flare ups for well over a year and my last colosostopy was so good, every 3 or 4 years is no all I have to consider.",5
"I am on this drug for a flareup that occurred this summer.  However I will be requesting that my doctor take me off it, as the side effects are too serious for me to be comfortable with.  We would also like to have children in the next few years.  I would encourage anyone with IBD issues to research and seriously consider the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I started it a few months ago and feel great - no bleeding and I've been regular for months!  Over the holidays I ate food I wasn't sure about (not sure if it contained sugars or starches) and found that my symptoms began to return, while still on the medication.  The testimonials I've read and my own experience so far have convinced me to give this diet a real try and I would like to try it without medications.  I felt compelled to share this because so many people sound so hopeless when the drugs don't work or quit working and most doctors won't mention the diet, either because they don't know about it or because they don't believe it works.  I would encourage anyone with concerns about their treatment to research and seriously consider giving this diet a chance, and discuss it with your doctor too - it's hard at first but there are many many wonderful supportive websites.  A good book to start with is ""Breaking the Vicious Cycle"" by Elaine Gottschall.  I got mine on Amazon.  Best of luck.",3
I have UC now for 10 years and currently am on predisone as well as 6MP.  The side effects are hair loss and diarahea but the colitis is in remission.  I tried methatrexate but experienced extreme memory loss so this is my only alternative since methotrexate caused severe memory loss.  After 10 years most of the lower dosage medications for anti inflammatory do not work anymore such as Asacol etc,4
"I have had UC since 2004 with little improvement from taking Colozal or other meds. My flair ups come and go, but as of early 2008 my flair ups caused my doctor to start me on 6mp. I must say, reviewing all the side effects concerned me, but I thought to give it a try. I was on it for 2 months and felt a lot better, no cramps or urgencies. However, I stopped taking 6mp because of the fear of getting cancer or other side effects from long term use. I am in my late 20's and feel the risks out weigh the benefit. About 1 month after stopping all medications, my flair ups began. Is there no hope once diagnosed with UC?",3
I have had UC for about 2yrs. I have tried several other medication. This is the first to allow me the 1st sense of relief and for once I am actualy not having to take high doses of prednisone. ,4
"My daughter was diagnosed with mild crohns disease 4 yrs ago.For the past 2 yrs , she has been on 6mp. ( a medicine given off label for crohns, no clinical studies on children ) this medication is very potent and decreases white blood count. Therefore, leading it to be a medication with major side effects. This medication is suppose to be monitored with weekly then monthly blood tests. My daughter went every 3 months , and approx 8 months ago : I asked for all copies of blood labs , tests , etc . I noticed that her WBC and Lymp counts were out of range: LOW. The dr dismissed this by saying it was an effect of 6mp. I sought out additional help  ,and after 2 months of blood tests : she was just diagnosed with auto immune disorder with monthly IVIG transfusions for life. After dozens of hours on the internet , talking to FDA and drug manu : I am wondering if ANYONE ( child / adult ) had any side effects of taking 6mp longterm ???",1
This medication has a side effect of severe knee and hip joint pain.  During the mornings I can hardly walk.  I have APL and am using this medication to slow down the growth of the cancer cells.  I have to take a pain medication to help relieve the pain in my leg joints.  I will be seeking advise as to other medication with few side effects.,3
"i took this med. along with a few other meds. i have just eliminated it because of severe knee pain... i still have the bad knee pain..i have ulcerative colitis, im 16 and have been hospitalized 5 times in 6 months..the colitis seems under control but the knee pain is extreme and prevents me from doing much of anything..my dr.s dont know why its this bad ....",2
I have been using this medication for about 4 years and have no problems,4
"I have been on every type of drug for Crohn's disease and have not been in remission for ine year I have been on this medicine for five weeks and I have been feeling pretty good, before I took this drug I couldn't leave the house I was going to the bathroom about 10times a day had was very week I went down to l06 pounds from 138 pds. and I couldn't eat nowI am eating and weight l09 pds. I also am on entocort and flaygl. I do have to take blood tests with this medicie I don't like the side effects but I had no choice but to take this medicine it was my last resort so far I am feeling pretty good.",3
I have been on this for three weeks now and see no  improvement yet. I have Crohns for four years have tried everthing after awhile nothing works for me.,1
"I have had uc for ten years but just recently diagnosed.I was on prednisone for 2 months and hated it because my face blew up really really bad!!! I am now on 6mp and love it!!! I was very scared to take it. I researched it alot and decided to go for it. I am doing very good on it, no hair lose,which I was soooo afraid of. I am a little bit more tired but not bad at all. I've been on it for about six weeks and my colitis hasn't flared up at all. I feel alive again!!",5
"I am afraid of taking this med.  I have just found out about a month ago that I have Chrones.  My doctor wants me to start 6-mp, but i am scared.  Please email me if you have any advice.  [email protected]",1
I've had crohn's sinse 1980 and sulfasal azine has worked for me all these years a;ong with the occasional use of a decreased dosage for flare-ups.  Earlier this year I had a tough flare up and my doctor felt I should take 6Mp as well.  I take 2 and 1/2 tablets a day.  do not like to take so much medicine and hope that I can some day come off of it.  however. I hade felt very good and credit the new med. for the improvement. also have blood tests to make sure vital signs remain normal.  ,4
"I was diagnosed with UC in 2003 (it went untreated for about 6 months).  It was under control with Colazal and occasional prendisone usage.  I had a big flare up during the end of 2006 and was taking prendisone for about a year (horrible, horrible side effects).  I moved and got a new doctor and he put me on 6MP (and kept the Colazal) in late 2007.  It has been pretty great.  I have noticed that I don't heal as quickly as I used to and that I need more sleep to feel well rested.  I have not had any noticeable hair loss and I don't seem to get sick (cold, flu, etc) anymore than I usually do per year.  ",5
"If my blood counts are ok I will begin the 6MP next week.  I am excited but scared of some of the side effects. The loss of hair worries me but then I want to live without the pain and complications of UC. Does anybody have any sugestions or words of wisdom? Please, please help!  -Scared but desperate!",3
No side effects for me.  I have Chron's and am controlling my diease,5
"I was diagnosed with UC two years ago. I caught it early so I haven't had too many problems. I basically tried everything in the book for it - Asocol, Colzal, Prednisone, secial diets, etc. Some of them would calm the colitis but the side effects were far worse. Now I am on 6MP and the colitis has pretty much subsided. I am having the hair loss issues as well. I am getting married in 6 months and I am afraid that I will be bald and have to wear a wig. My doctor claims that this medicine doesn't cause people to lose their hair but after reading other people's messages, I know that it must. Thanks!",3
I have UC.  I have been sick for over 4 years with no solutions - asacol / prednizone ... nothing worked.  Mercaptopurine has saved me - I have not been sick for weeks.  I eat vegetables again / fiber again - I just cannot have dairy or peanuts (?).  I have never felt more alive - and with no side effects.  I have my life back to where I was before.,5
"Ive had mild UC since 1984. Flared up in March when I lost my mom. New GI doc proscribed this, and switched me to Lialda from Azulfidine EN, which I had been taking for 24 years.  Ive been having muscle spasms in the neck, chest, back, and legs.  Difficulty breathing. Waking up 4 times a night to take a hot shower to relieve the pain. I cant say if this is withdrawal from the Azulfidine or due to Mercaptopurine. My UC was never terrible before, but now I cant live/walk/sleep. I dont mean to scare anyone away from a potentially good drug, but this is nuts.  Waiting on blood tests to see whats happening before he makes a change.  I have been on this less than a week now.  Note that past lapses in Azulfidine did cause joint pain and increased UC activity, but never anything like this....",1
I have only been taking this med for about 9 Months. I have Crohns disease - active at this time. This is the first time I have taken this med. I'am still not crazy that I'am taking this - due to the side effects. I have had 5 surgery's for my crohns. My last surgery was 3 years ago and the one prior to that was 11 years. Therefore because it came back so fast the Doctor wanted me on this med. I don't like hearing that it can cause hair loss - not good.,4
"After Asacol not working and a needed 6 weeks of Prednisone to relieve major inflammation, this drug has worked for me to reduce my severe Ulcerative Colitis.  However, I have been on it for about 6 months and asked the DR when I can stop since I am in remission.  He informed me ""never"" according to the Mayo Clinic Dr.'s.  Apparently sometimes those that stop have the condition return and when put back on the meds, they no longer work.  Now 1 month later my white blood cells are so low they are telling me to stop taking the medication.  I am leary to do so as I don't want the Colitis to return but I am so weak right now I don't think I will have a choice.  I am hoping my count will rise quickly so I can resume the medication.",4
This has been the best treatment for my Crohns a couple months after i started taking it started feeling amazingly better and it has got me in remission i have had no side effects and i would recommend this drug cause it has truly worked wonders for me.,5
"I have fought UC for many years not knowing that I had it.  Dx in 2004 following a scope.  No flares until 2007.  Am now on Asacol and 6MP with some minor improvement.  I still cannot go to the office as the restroom is too far from my desk.  Tried the steroids, which worked, however, side effects were not worth the results.   Has anyone who is on 6mp suffered with hair loss?  I used to have very thick hair and now I need to wear a wig after 30 days of being on the drug.",2
I have had Crohns disease for approx 5 years now. I went through so many medications before finding a doctor who offered this one. Miracle Drug! I have had little to now flare ups since switching to this one and my condition has been stable. I hope they find a cure one day but until then- this drug makes me feel as normal as possible- I can function like normal again and not be keeled over in pain everyday of my life.,5
"Crohns: many years of IBD before properly treated. Doctors tried all remedies. Had 25"" of small bowel removed. After surgery all well for 3 months and flared back up. Treated with Azacol with severe side effects before being swicthed to mercaptopurine. Have had 1 mild flare up in the 1 year since being prescribed 6-MP and switched dosage from pm to am. Have nothing but Great to say about this drug. Great doctor helps, also.",4
"son with crohn's since 9 yo.c/o pressure in throat, tired,while on 6 mp, helps with stomache aches, less frequency of severe bouts of  disease",3
"so far no side effects, but also so far no relief. I have Severe Ulcerative  Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis. I take the seriods with it, and I seem to get the moon pie face, but I havent gained wieght, so that is good for me.  Has anyone had great luck with this? Or is surgery goine to be my only other option? I have had this disease for 19yrs now, and I am tired of it.",3
This Medication caused my daughter to loose all her hair and stop production of blood cells and was hospitalized for a month,1
Has worked for the most part.  Ocassional pain and flair ups but not suvere.  Crohn's,4
I have taken this for 3 years with little improvement from meds only from surgery. It caused my liver enzymes to get to a toxic level. ,2
I have been taking 6MP for a number of years to treat my Crohn's Disease. To date my flare ups have been minimal ...  Thank G-d!,4
Have taken thus for several years and it has worked better than Azacol and Colazol to which I had severe side effects.,3
I have taken this medication with little result. It seems that I still get alot of ups and downs. I take this medication for chrones disease.,1
"Avoid it if you can! Though Mercaptopurine (6mp) is primarily a cancer chemotherapy, I was being treated for IBD with this drug in years 1999-2000, for approximately 3 months.  At the time it was widely believed to be a potentially effective therapy for IBD.  I am uncertain of its current medical status in this regard. However, having no other primary causation, I contracted sever liver cirrhosis which effects me in exceptionally negative ways.  Later, I was a cancer patient and the cirrhosis compromised my cancer treatment.  I have been diagnosed with ""cryptogenic cirrhosis"" (unknown or mysterious origin) though I strongly suspect the 6mp to be the primary causal factor. It's very powerful chemotherapy in some cases, but similarly has potentially very strong side effects. If you are predisposed to liver problems, you certainly do not want to use this drug if you can avoid it. Likewise, even if you do not have liver issues, I would try to avoid it in favor of alternatives with similar or better records of effectiveness.  The significance of severe liver disease as a possible side effect of 6mp is a high life-threatening and/or life-shortening risk, not to mention severe reductions in quality of the remainder of life.",1
it sucks!!,3
"At first I found that I was very tired and sleepy and did not feel quite like myself. However, the bleeding stopped which was the goal of this treatment. I would highly recommend this medication and drink the required amount of liquids to keep your bladder flushed.",5
"I have been on methotrexate for 8-9 years, I've been telling my Dr. that my bones and joints ache(hurt) also I get very cold and can't get my body warmed up, with out laying on a heated mattress pad for lengths of time. How do I get my Dr. to listen to me and try a different drug? so I don't have these side effects?",3
So far- so good- itâ??s been only 3 weeks- I have had minimal side effects and hope the low dose works to put it into remission ,3
Very difficult to deal with.  Causes extreme fatigue. Was taking 20 mg per week now cut back to 15mg due to surgery on hip. After taking nauseous the whole next day.  I take with Arava and prednison for ra,3
"I came down with a rare mouth issue called Lichen Planus.  There is no cure for this and there is not much research done on the disease.  I see, of all things, a dermatologist for this issue.  I go to the UAB hospital in Birmingham, AL, where the doctor has seen a lot of patients suffering this disease.  The one problem I suffer is the hair loss.  I fill the tub with hair now.  The back of my chair has hair all over it.  My hair has stopped growing.  The doctor has cut back my dosage to see if this helps, but this page says this ""should stop"" after treatment has ""stopped.""  So I guess I will continue to lose hair until I am bald or she changes my treatment.  It has helped the Lichen Planus for now.  It comes and goes.  She has tried other drugs also with success.  There is no absolute treatment for this disease.  Pray you don't get it.  It causes all kinds of mouth issues.  Google it to see what I am talking about.  But, the Metho works, just is making me go bald.",4
"Still having problems with mouth ulcers, and now having nose ulcers too. I take 12 tablets every Thursday ,like clock work. ",4
I have been taking this for 2 years with minimal effectiveness. I continued because some was better than none. I had some side effects like hair loss and fatigue. I have added a nutritional cleansing routine this year and that has given me my life back. I'm hoping to be off meds soon.  ,2
Have been taking 15mg weekly for 14 months without a flair-up.  Some almost insignificant pain in my thumbs.  Have been off steroids for 6 months.  I have had no side effects so far.  I am happy with the results,5
"I have been in for four weeks now. It has helped with flair ups ans swelling, but really find I'm tired. Almost surprises me that i need to sleep or nap right now. ",4
 Am not sure it does much but I can't afford the other treatments (biologics) so I have stayed with this drug.  My hair is really thinning out though - may consider not using it and just staying with my anti-inflammatory.,3
"Used for approx. two months, showing very little clear ups, on the other hand , little too NO side effects",3
"Take this with folic acid and humira, works best of what I have tried. Used to be on sulfaalzine,  plaquenil  and prednisone. Still have pain in hands, neck and knee, also dry itchy skin",3
I have been on this drug for 2 years. I also take Simponi. I have no flares. I am tired a lot and have to take a nap each day but very much worth it. Just found out my lungs are covered with nodulers. No systoms but showed up in CT scan for another problem. I haven't talked to my RA doctor yet. Will see him Monday and hopefully will find out if this drug has this side effect.,5
"After being treating for bilateral knee pain with narcotics for osteoarthritis, swelling and unbearable aching to the point I could not sleep my new doc put me on methotrexate and within a week I was 90% pain free. It worked for me for over 8 months but it's back. Uping the dose and hoping for a repeat performance. Have three boys. Two 5 year olds and a 7. Wife is a nurse. Gotta be able to be a parent.",4
"MY MOTHER WAS ON THIS MED FOR BOTH HER PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS. SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED IN THE ICU TWICE WITH ""METHOTREXATE POISONING"" AND DIED THE SECOND TIME AROUND, HAVING ALSO CONTRACTED ECOLI. You already have an immune disorder if you're being prescribed this drug. These drugs suppress your immune system even more. All the pharmacists I've worked with have told me they personally would opt not to take the most meds being prescribed for these illnesses because ""they are toxic"".",1
"I am in NZ and was unable to move or walk absolutely crippled with RA.  They moved me onto this drug and its being brillant for holding off RA.  Flare ups and side effects (hair loss, tiredness) are definitely minor to the drug usefulness.  My sister also to the drug but was dizzy and nauseous so had to stop taking it. Suits some but not all, but best to try for a while as sometimes the first few weeks are the worse. ",5
I have suffered sever side effects from the oral methotrexate and have not been able to remain on this medication.,3
I have had a good experience except it makes me loose my appetite to the point of my losing over 20lbs. Ive started working on eating more & maintaining as I prefer this than going to other meds.,4
"I have a rare disease dermatomyosytis I am taking metho and have horrible sweats, even if I am doing nothing, like a hot flash only worse.  I exercise, eat fairly well and I am noticing very little relief of my external symtoms of course I need to wait for blood work to see if it is helping with the muscle part of my illness.  I do not think this is working for me",3
This medication made feel horrible. I had trouble breathing and the day after taking it could barely get out of bed. I would feel a little better after the first day but still had shortness of breath. ,2
"Methotrexate was prescribed for Psoriatic Arthritis and I took 20mg a week for 8 years. The drug was effective at controlling the PA but I was diagnosed with Cirrhosis Stage 4 and now need a liver transplant. I suffered Esophageal Varices in Jan 2012, 8 endoscopies, two liver tumors with ChemoEmbolization and Radio Frequency Ablation in March 2013, then Hepatic Encephalopathy in Oct 2013.

"My husband has had psoriasis since 1999 & was diagnosed with PsA last year. He had severe (70%) coverage when he started taking MTX last year. His psoriasis was almost gone within a month. He was taken off of MTX in May due to surgery, & his psoriasis came back with a vengeance. He just restarted the MTX on Dec 7, & we can already see a 50-60% improvement in his P. As for his arthritis, he has PsA & Osteoarthritis. We have already seen a big improvement in his PsA, but of course not the OA. Because he has had kidney issues all his life, they monitor his blood work a little more often than usual (1X/month), but everything has been really good. No real complaints here.",5
"Using 20 mg once a week for about 8 years.  No flare ups, only side effects are fatigue and need for naps.  I can do full range of activities-bike, hike, fish, hunt, tennis and golf but not for as long duration.  Very stiff after exercise or activity BUT NO PAINFUL FLAREUPS  that used to leave me with useless limbs.  ",5
"have taken 20mg for 5 yrs now also 500mcg folic acid 2 times a day this stops the mouth sores ,has given me much less pain, I used to live on very heavy addictive pain killers, they are not the answer , they only mask and can make you feel crazy. ",5
I have psiotic (spelling) arthritis mostly in my wrist.  Mayo client gave this to me and I have been on it for 4 weeks now.   Also had cordisone shots in my wrist for the pain.   That took the pain away until this medicine has time to work.   The few spots of psoriasis I had left are all gone.  You must have blood work done every 3 months.   Also take folic acid.   I have no pain anywhere.,4
"Arthritis pain gone,Psoriasis improved. After Prednisone to get under control I started methotrexate and very satisfied.",5
"Approx. 18,mos. ago stated with 3 tabs. 7.5mg for 20, weeks then 6,tabs 15mg for 24, weeks then 9, tabs. 22.5 for 30 weeks. Results are minimal, no noticeable side effects yet.",2
"I have been taking this for 22 years with excellent results. I play tennis, hike, do yard work with no problems if I limit to about 4 hours a day. started with 3 pills a week, now take 6 per week. Occasional flare, maybe 2 or 3 per year, requires a couple of advil or if more severe maybe 4 day dosepack of prednisone. No side effects at this time. I do regular blood tests to check.",5
"I was taking the 6 pills every friday, after about 4 months I started to feel a big improvement, not being woke up by pain at night etc., my MD wanted to have me start with Humira but I refused so we switched me to self-injections (ugh) to up the dose and less trauma for my stomach.  Its been going ok, but this last week my husband and I found a lot of nodules on my thighs, that explains the strange pains that I've been having. So, I'll have to do some research and discuss with my MD as to a plan of action. I haven't really felt all the fatigue that some speak of, thank goodness and generally have felt so much better.  Everyone is different and reacts or not differently. I have worked with physicians for many years, you must be your own best advocate, do your homework and don't be afraid to say NO to any treatment that you are unsure of!",5
FIRST DOSAGE 4-2.5 MG TABS 7/7/13,3
"I have taken the 17mg weekly of metho for over 18yr. mo. checks of liver, all clear. Lupus is well controlled along with prednisone, plaquenil, and anti-inflammatories. Flares are usually due to high stress or fatigue situations. In my case it has been a prayer answered for RA, Lupus & Fibro.  ",4
"5mg to 8mg for flare ups, very sick at my stomach and tireness over well me",3
I have been on this drug for 6 weeks and increase from 10mg to 15mg.  I can see no improvement with the pain.  I get stomach cramps when I take the meds and then nausea for a couple of days.,3
I have taken this med on & off since I was in my early twentys. I tried a biologic med to treat my psoriasis but it just did not work for me. Metholtrexate has worked best for me.,4
"This is the only drug that has worked for my mild-to-moderate seronegative RA, and I initially tried not to take it due to fear of side effects. When I was diagnosed 5 years ago, I tried anti-inflammatories, Plaquenil, sulfasalizine, Arava, and the biologics. All of those either didn't improve my symptoms or caused unbearable or scary side effects. I will not take prednisone. Eventually, I gave in and tried the methotrexate at 15mg/week, and it worked immediately. After about a year, I went down to 10mg/week, and I've been stable and virtually symptomless ever since. X-rays and scans show no permanent joint damage. I realize that I am very lucky. I initially had and still deal with hairloss and fatigue. The hairloss has lessened for me over time, though, and like other reviewers, I take my weekly dose at the beginning of the weekend to be able to deal with the fatigue. I still don't like having to take it and worry about long-term effects, but for me, the benefits definitely outweigh the negative. ",5
This is a wonder drug. Worked right off the bat!,4
Developed blood clots after taking drug for one week.  Was hospitalized and told to never take it again.,1
"I have been on it for 3 mths. i have been getting severe headaches four days a week, very nauseas and am now getting dizzy spells. it has helped my hands but not worth all the side effects. the dr. called today and left a message saying my liver function was high. calling tomorrow and stopping the meds.",4
Side affects of this drug were Growths on the bones which were painful.  Had to get what appears to be unnecessary surgery to remove.  After stopping the use of this drug all of the remaining Growths went away.,1
"something is making me break out in hives, i have had them for a few months.",2

"Psoriatic skin lesions cleared fairly rapidly on 10, 2.5 mgs tabs weekly. Daily folic acid. Gradually have reduced to 4, 2.5 mgs weekly and feel better but have skin outbreaks recurring. Medicine affects taste resulting in loss of appetite.Some hair loss. Worst side effect is 1-3 days after dosing suffer with 1 bout of severe intestinal dumping which happens without warning requiring need to stay home and sometimes emergency return home thereby seriously restricting activities. Less medicine, diet do not seem to stop the intestinal side effect.",3
"I have been on methotrexate for approximately 4 years 6 2.5 mg once a week, it has been quite affective with controlling my inflamation, I do find taking it with food helps with the nausea.  My hair started to fall out when I first started taking it, but after a few months it stopped and grew back in curly (and I had very fine straight hair)so that was a plus.  I take it on a Saturday so I can deal with the fatigue before Monday.",4
methotrexate combined with prednisone to treat rheumatoid arthritis.,3
"I have been on this medicine for over a year now.  I am on 7 pills a week.  I am also on Mobic for inflammation, predisone and folic acid.  I am down to 2.5 mg on predisone and hope to come off soon.  I have not had any effects from the medicine except it makes me sick and tired.  I tend to take it right before I go to bed so I dont have to deal with the nausea and tiredness as much.  I forgot I do take 2mg of folic acid because I was seeing an increase in hair loss.  Overall it has worked great",5
"Started taking 7weeks ago very scared after reading reviews,but so far so good no side effects. My hands feel 95% better. I haven't had to take any NSAIDS for pain so very happy.",4
"I had ugly psoriasis patches on my face & elbows plus arthritis.DR perscribed 2.5mg tabs - (2Fri/2Sat). Not much help so DR upped it to 6 tabs per wkend and for past 1+yrs seems to do the trick. My psoriasis cleared up nicely in conjunction with OXY (maximum) Face Wash and consistent use of Cetaphil lotion.I do have strange / bad dreams occasionally and do seem to be very tired. I do take folic acid, lisinopril, 81mg aspirin and citalopram as well. Not sure which or combo is causing tiredness but I can sleep lots unless I set alarm. I also seem to have strange ""tingling"" in my legs sometimes when trying to sleep.It's like I have to move them-walk around or something to make it stop. Usually goes away after 20mins or so. Thought it might be potassium - have gotten up and eaten a banana...not sure if it was the walk or the banana that got rid of the tingle.Overall, I am very happy with the effect on my psoriasis, pain is manageable. Prior to this RX I was eating Aleve like candy--6-8 per day, seriously. I am also overweight which obviously doesn't help. Am somewhat concerned about the possible effects to liver and bones. Also was perscribed 50K Vit D per week plus 1000 Vit D daily with the Methotrexate. Hopefully that will help keep the bones intact.",3
have to take it by iv inj due to stomach problems,4
"My mother took this drug for three years, and she died from having methotrexate toxicity her dose was extremely high and her provider did not monitor her with blood work-ups. it depressed her bone marrow, resulting her hospitalization. The doctors at three different hospitals tried to help her recover but were not successful.  I would suggest this drug be taken off the market",1
I've been on drug for at least 15 years.  No problems (so far)  Now take 6 per week Rx Folic Acid taken on other 6 days per week.RA diagnosed 30 yrs. ago with other meds tried prior to Methotrexate.  All eventually lost effectiveness.  So far current dose has done the job.,5
It took awhile before (4-6 months) I could tell any effects. It does sometime cause nausia and next day fatigue. I went as high as (8) 2.5mg each week and am now taking (5) each week. I am satisfied with the results it has shown.  ,5
Recently started on this drug. I haven't really see the effect fully kick in as of now.,4
methotrexate makes me feel very natious and gives me dirrea,1
"I just started yesterday, and slept through the night for the first time in months. despite my hesitance to use this medication. My Dr. thought I should give it a trial for a month. so far so good.",4
"4 years on Methotrexate.  No problems. Taken for Psoriatic Arthritis (like RA). Doesn't do much for psoriasis, but helps with arthritis.  Great in tandem with Enbrel or Humira. I take 6 - 2.5mg pills. ",4
Before taking this I was unable to move my hands. I could not walk without pain. I had big open sores on my hands and feet becouse of the psoriasis. The Arthritis associated with the psoriasis was so bad I could not function. I have been taking this for a year and my life is alot better. I have cramps in the stomack and dont fell well for about a day but my life is much better with this drug I will keep taking it. ,5
I am spitting 24 hours a day since taking this medication.,3

"Psorisis decreased considearbaly. Am taking five 2,5 mgms every Monday along woth Prednisone (on alternate days) Folic acid daily.",4
at first i seemed to be ok with it but when i had taken my 10th round i started really having bad effects. i have asthma and now i have frequienet chest pains and my liver enzimies have sky rocketed. so now my dr has taken me off of it. i ask my ra dr what would happen if i was taken off of it he said my lupus would probably get 10 times worse.,2

"just started, second dose ",2
"Taking 8 pills weekly.Feet still hurt,with burning pain.Hands stiff,joints pop on thumbs.No side effects YET.RH wants to go with more agressive meds.Do not know which way to go.",4
I had very painful swollen joints my ankle was swollen twice it's normal size when I began my treatment.  We had to increase to dose for several weeks but at about 6 weeks I was able to walk much better and most of the swelling in my joints went away.  I am still in pain but able to manage most day to day tasks.  I am also very tired and don't know if this is the medication or the disease.,4
began mtx 10/08 after a severe few months of constant flare ups.  i didn't believe this drug would work so well.  after 2 weeks if felt 98% better.  i still ache but no flare ups so far.  i have recently cut back from 15 mgs to 12.5 mg weekly.  i hope to cut it back to 10 mg but we'll see.  i also take a multi vitamin and folic acid daily.  no side effects.,5
"I have just taken 3rd dose today(once weekly,10mg),also still on prednisone and aleve daily. Nauseated for a hour or two after dose and very tired that day.

"I have taken Methotrexate for approximately 6 years.  For the past few months however, I have noticed more episodes in which my arthritis has flared up requiring me to take steroids for a short period.  My rhematologist has considered changing my treatment plan, but I have had chronic sinus infections, and have hesitated in switching up until now.  I recently was found to have a mass which appears benign pressing against my esophagus.  They are still in the process of diagnosing this nodule, but I am wondering if it could not be rheumatoid in nature.  I mentioned this to my family physician and he seems to believe this is not the case.  As yet, I have not had the opportunity to mention this to my rheumatologist, as my next appointment is not until May.  I plan on giving him a call however.  If it does prove to be rheumatoid in nature, I plan on switching to another form of treatment.  ",4
"I'm taking this drug to keep my kidneys from failing as a result of my lupus. According to my doctor, half the time it works and half the time it doesn't appear to be the best option for me. The nausea is unbearable though, and the schedule is difficult to conform to with my chronic fatigue. However, I guess this is the best option I have right now (and for the next two years at least) so if it's between failing kidneys or a little nausea, I'll take the nausea any day.",3
i take this drug for lupus and its not working,1
"I have ""Ankylosing Spondylitis"" and so far the methotrexate has worked great.  I take Folic Acid with it and just had my first blood test, but don't know the results yet.  It sure has helped with the swelling in my hands and feet and the stiffness in my back and neck.",5
"I take methotrexate for Dermatomyositis an inflammatory auto immune disease, my skin had a Lupus like rash but my fingers were splitting at the cuticles and my rash was purple and very itchy. I could hardly get out of bed , brush my hair or walk without being out of breath. I was so weak with muscle inflammation. Methotrexate 15 and prednisone(now  low) dose, along with leucovorin for side effects at first my hair started to fall out but not all and I was nauseaus and tired the day I took it and the day after. I tolerate it well now and my skin is clear I can run up the stairs if I have a good nights sleep. I worry aabout side effects but don't want to go back to being bedridden and in pain.",4
"DX'd with RA in July 2008, on MTX since August 2008 minimal side effects, take 1mg Folic Acid able to discontinue Prednisone after 3 months.  Still have some swelling in toes where erosions were already present - tingling/burning in legs and feet, that worsen when bad weather approaches.  Currently @ 20mg per week may be increasing dosage soon or adding another DMARD.  Don't let long list of potential side effects scare you, be sure to tell your RD all your symptoms, side effects and concerns.",4
"I was given this drug to help the symptoms of my lupus but it was not helpful because I got violently ill and I chose not to take it although the doctor said this was a typical ""side effect.""  Symtoms of the lupus were easier to handle. ",1
The constant pain in the legs is so much better.  I take 2 folic tablets each day to counteract effects of meds.  Occasionally have some joint pain that seems to disappear within a day.  Have taken many others meds and injections but find this has helped the most.  I have had some occasional stomach discomfort,4
I have been taking this medication for two years.I am hla-b27 positive and have rheuumtiod arthritis and psoriasis and iritis. I feel the pills are helping me some but am worried about the side effects.I take 15 mg a week,3

I have been taking methotrexate for over 12 years and controls my psoriasis with no side effects. The blood test and biopsies are annoying but a small price to pay for being clear. ,4
I have been taking shots for 3 months and have really bad dreams every night.Is it from the shots?,3
I just started this 3 weeks ago and take 5 pills in 2 days. So far no results.,2
"Im too young to feel this achy...between my asthma and RA, I feel I can't win.  My doctors want to get me off the prednisone and, maybe, methotrexate, but I know how I'm going to feel in a couple of weeks!!!  OTC products do not work --- tired of wasting I do not have.  I'm at my wits end!",3
I was on Methotrexate for 5 weeks maybe not long enough for it to take full effect but had to stop because of wosening headaches that started after I began taking the self administered injections. I also experienced blurred vision and reverberating sounds in my head - possibly from headaches. Headaches were constant after the 4th week and were bad enough for me to be out of work for 3 weeks - I not not missed a day from work in 20 years before that. ,1
"I feel sick the day I take it and 2-3 days after, I have no energy, I still have swelling in fingers, feet and wrist, sores I never had before, and I have a sore throat, like it is swollen. I'm showing little improvement and will be changing meds.",3
"nausea,headaches,tired all the time.Toes and fingers joints still ache.got 2 boils on upper leg--never before.nervous about continuing this drug",1
I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. one year ago I only had 25% use of my hands now I have full use.  I had alot of side effects when taking the tablet form but since going on the injections I've had no problems at all.  All tests still come back with normal levels.  It's keeping my Arthritis and Lupus in check.  Doesn't help or hinder the fibromyalgia.,5
Helped clear up most of most patches.  Have some still on hands.  Take 4pills at 2.5 once weekly.  No side effects but always have the worries in the back of my mind.  I also take folic acid daily to combat side effects and have blood tests monthly.,4
My grandmother is on this medication and is had pleural effusions.  They are actually putting a tube in her chest so that it can be drained at home.    There is a lot online linking methotrexate with pleural effusions but her Dr didn't want to even discuse this as a cause.  Has anyone else had pleural effusions while on methotrexate?  ,3
"I've had psoriasis for more than 20 years with very bad outbreaks sometimes. This medication has worked wonders for me each time I go on it. My dermatologist would put me on 6x2.5mg once a week for 6 weeks, then reduce dosage to zero gradually. Each time I take these pills, my outbreak clears miraculously. But problem is, my psoriasis has a tendency to come back a few months after I go off the pills. I also go for regular blood test to ensure my liver is clear. This medication is a godsend to me when I'm depressed over a very bad outbreak that ointment couldn't help much. It's my short quick fix whenever I need to clear my skin of the ugly psoriasis outbreak, but I only go on this medication only in times of heavy outbreak as I'm afraid of possible side effects.",5
with this medication my rheumatoid arthritis has not slowed down and i stay sick and can't eat anything for at least 2-3 days after taking it.,2
"I have had palm psoriasis for 6 years. Was refered to this drug about 2 months ago. Started out with 7.5mg per week. Every time I took this medication I would get ill. Vomiting, nausiea, migraines, fever, the list is endless. After taking this for 4 weeks my Dr. added another 5mg to the 7.5mg I had already been taking.  Side effects continued to get worse. My psoriasis didn't get much better. The illness and side effects made this medication not worth taking.",3
"I had a so called ""reaction"" to this medication and I believe anyone who is considering it for any disease should be very careful about side effects.  I started on a low dose and had some warning signs but because these side effects are so ""rare"" the doctor dismissed these signs as not related to the Methotrexate.  He doubled my dose to 7 mg and within 8 hours I was in the ER vomiting with diarrhea that was black and smelled extremely foul and like chemicals.  Everyone in the ER was sent to my room to help. I was in the hospital for five days. I had mouth sores, history of a gastric ulcer, history of sensitivity to medications.  I was being treated for lupus.  This medication may be very helpful for many people but sometimes I think the ""rare"" reactions are dismissed too regularly because they are so adamantly labeled ""RARE.""  I am also afraid that many cases of these kind of reactions are under reported after all the official studies are done where somehow the rare side effects are overlooked.  My advice is to be very careful and take it slowly with this drug.     It's tempting to say only bad things about this drug considering the hell I went through because of it.  It might be that this drug might help a lot of people with serious disease with agonizing symptoms.  But when you read about it in detail, it is pretty scary what can happen to you.  You better have a very good doctor who can pick up on the nuances of your disease and what are truly VERY IMPORTANT side effects.  Good luck to you all.",1
I have been taking this drug now for 3 months 12.5mg weekly for Polymyalgia Reheumatica. Symptoms are still with me but intermittent not constant. Diarrhea has been a troublesome side effect. ,3

"although this pill is hard on my stomach, and ive noticed more hair than normal falling out- its a very effective treatment for my RA. The results completely outweigh the side effects and im very glad my doctor started me on this prescription.

"I have been on this medication (4ml) for 4 weeks.  I take it on Wednesday, and Thursday I get the sweats!  I mean pouring down sweating.  It continues until about Sunday and begins to subside.  Then the cycle begins again.  The first three injections, by Friday I felt as if I were hit by a truck, but this past Friday I felt okay.  Not as bad.  But the plus side of this is I am experiencing a dramatic decrease in SLE symptoms.  Does anyone else experience these sweating episodes?",4
"It took around 7 weeks of shots until it began to work.  Now I look forward to it as towards the end of the week I am really getting swollen.  I also take Palqnil and Sulphasalazine.  I use Rogaine for hair loss, which started before Methotrexate.  It works great.  You  just have to use it every night.  Also I take Biotin and use Biotin shampoo. I do miss my wine...",5
"Love/hate relationship with methotrexate. I'm sure others can relate. Im on injectable mtx, (1ml) which is much easier on my stomach than the pills were. The medicine works and I have taken with and without a biologic combo. It is not a cure all, but it gives me a dramatic reduction in symptoms. Of course, I love that part. The hate part... side effects. The days after my weekly injection, I feel fatigue, nausea and generally sick. I read somewhere high carb food the night of the injection helps, so I tried it. Not sure if its the carbs or simply having a filling meal since I usually don't eat much for a few days after, but it has helped. I also have nausea meds on standby and take 1 mg folic acid 6x week. Another downside is you do become more vulnerable to infection and have to stop treatment every time you get sick. My flares get really bad with each stop. With each start, getting through the first few weeks, especially the nausea, are difficult. Also, just recently began experiencing very bad muscle spasms, especially in my legs and feet. Not sure what that is about and why its just starting after years on the drug. The good news... even with the side effects, I'm happy to have something that helps fight this disease. ",4
"I've been taking 1ml sq weekly w/Enbrel (tried Remicade, Arava, Humira, Actemra always go back to Enbrel) for around 13 yrs., first in pill form then switched to injectable in 2006. According to my Dr., the injectable is ""absorbed"" 20% better than pill(my RA has been pretty severe most of the 14 yrs. I've had it). It does help me somewhat, but I'm starting to feel some side effects (headaches, occasional nausea, hair loss) so I've been on again/off again with it. My biggest problem with this med. is what it does to my hair...Yes, I know that sounds very superficial, however this disease has robbed me of enough. I've got scars all over from this disease (surgeries), my fingers are severely deformed and now my hair is becoming so dry & brittle that it breaks off every time I style/comb it (worn up in clip always), not to mention the handful that I lose every time I wash it (twice weekly, deep conditioning). I'm tired of finding my hair in, on, all over everything and I'm tired of having to unclog my shower drain on a regular basis (even though I use a drain cover to catch the hair). We'll see, I'm still on the fence about it. ",4
"Took injectable for 8 weeks.  No improvement and major side effects: nausea, joint pain, headache, fatigue.  Discontinued to dramatic drop in red blood count, ferritin and hematocrit, plus blood in stool.  Not a good option for me.  I am sensitive to medication.",1
Within an hour of the injection I feel weak and nausea. The next day I am bedridden with severe abdominal pain   and my nausea is worse. I quit taking methotrexate once and I felt great. My doctor advised me to stay on this drug since I can't take meds for inflammation. ,2
have only been on med for 5 weeks.,1
"I think I am having side affects from this medicine. I have blood in my stool and urine I had a EDG-colonoscopy and they found abnormal mucosa in the stomach compatible with gastritis,diverticulosis of the descending colon mass in the cecum the mass was a lipoma they biopsy everything. I am having test on the tenth of June they are going to scope my bladder and do a CT of my kidney and now I am having little knots popping up on my finger and on my thumb all of the sudden. My RA doctor knows this but do not seem to be concern. I am worried about the methotrexate I take 0.8 sq. once a week and Orencia infusion once a month I take  Celebrate twice a day Gabapentin, I know Celebrate has aspen in it after I get this other text and they do not fine anything I am going off the methotrexate myself I am telling my doctor to see if it is the medicine maybe the Orencia will be enough or maybe he can give me some thing else. I just want     Another opinion. ",5
I use the injectable because I've been on this med for over 18 years and the pills were giving me stomach problems.,5
"I have been diagnosed with Lupus for the last 11 years and my doc wanted to try the methotrex inj. About 6 hours after the injection i thought i was going to die! My muscles were so weak and shaky I dropped to the floor and couldn't get up. Pain all over my body, shortness of breath, headache, sore throat, shaking all over. It took 3 FULL days to get over the side effects. Won't ever try it again!",1
"since the oral meds was making me very sick, I was willing to give the injection a try. Once I got over the ease of the needles, it's been the easiest meds I have ever taken. It does not hurt at all,and is is sometimes trouble to get because companys have a shortage of making the drug. I always hve extra,so if they run out I have enough for a few extra months.",5
"The first few weeks, I had heavy fatigue but this gradually improved after 2-3 months. The med reduced knee swelling and pain - NSAIDs and plaquenil were used previously but had no affect. Was prescribed folic acid 1000mg oral in conjunction with methotrexate on days that I did not take Methotrexate inj.   Puzzle:  Continue to have a negative RF/RA test in spite of all other symptoms indicating RA (including an upcoming total knee replacement). The only positive lab test was elevated CPR=all other indications are physical symptoms or seen on xray/MRI. ",4
"Methotrexate has helped my RA but i have a lot of the side effects: nausea vomitting usually for two days after my inj also hair loss, fatigue, and malaise. But after three consecutive blood tests showing elevated liver enzymes my dr wont let me continue. I seem to have trouble with all meds and am AGAIN untreated besides pain meds which are near impossible to get not sure what to try next!",3
"My 6 year old daughter takes this to help with her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  She has been on it for almost 2 years.  She fights at times, which is why it is difficult to use.  Her arthritis has gotten a lot better over time, but recently has been having some side effects.  She gets sick quite a bit afterwards lately and it can last up to 2 days after getting her shot.  The doctor put her on an anti nausea pill to help and so far it seems to be helping.  She had both knees and ankles affected by her arthritis and is down to one knee.  Sometimes though I think her arthritis is better than the side effects from this medication, but we have to do what needs to be done.  I can't blame all the side effects on the methotrexate because she is also on indomethacin and that causes her a lot of heartburn.",5
"I have used it one for an ectopic preg. I have had severe pain to one side where ectopic took place, severe nausea, bleeding for about a month, I wish I would have just had the surgery. I recommend not be used for this sort of treatment. ",3
"It worked great for me. I had one injection, no pain with that. I had cramping and diarrhea the first night and that has been it. HCG has been going down by more than 50% each week.",5
"i used this med for my second ectopic pregnancy and the the first dose didn't work and so i had to receive another dose, i had bad side effects, dizziness, nausea, hair loss,shakiness, joint pain, bad dreams, sleepiness, mouth sores.",1
I have been injecting this for two months now and still haven't noticed the results my doctors have expected. ,3
'm being treated for Anklosing Spndlitis,2
I had been taking the pills for almost 2 1/2 years.  With very little results the pain was just a constint thing.  Most days I just wanted to stay in bed I hurt so much.  I talked to my Dr about changing to injectable and she thought it would be a good idea.  I have only been taking it for about a month now and am so happy with the results.  I am stiff in the morning but after a shower I feel great.  I am so happy with the difference.,5
"hair loss, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite (not bad thing I guess, I'm overweight anyways). I still have pain and swelling in my left hand. Very little flare ups, so far. Much of the pain and swelling is gone. I've been on the weekly shots for 5 weeks.",3
"I have been on Methotrexate since a year ago. It seemed to be helping and under care of my doctor.  I have developed an inflammed stomach lining and two ulcers due to this drug.  Other meds I am on do not leave me with any side affects.  I have had an ultrasound..am waiting for treatment from the Endoscopy doctor that did the tests.  It will be a type of medicine to heal my stomach.  I have been very sick and vomiting, dry heaves, and am limited to what I can eat.  Please make sure if you have any of these side affects, you inform your doctor immediately.  I am off the Methotrexate for good.  Not a good experience for me.  Thank You.",3
"I have been using Methotrexate injections for two months now and having the best results ever.  I feel so much better and can do so many more activities than before, I have no pain in all my joints and what a relief.  ",5
I was diagnosed with RA over 12 years ago. I've been injecting methotrexate for several years.  I take ibuprophen and Tramedol for inflammation and pain. I also supplement with folic acid and Vit D. I have my liver function tested on a regular schedule and have been very satisfied with the way my deterioration has slowed almost to a stop. I am very active and healthy! ,4
I have polymyositis and within the first week of diagnosis my Dr started me on metho.  I was taking one shot a week and was on it for about a year and a half.  Why he had  e on it for so long is a mystery to because I felt most of the side effects with no sign that the drug was helping.  It is a very hard on your body and almost 5 years later I have yet to get my hair back.  ,1
"The side effects of this drug are sproatic and vary. I can go weeks at a time without any and then I might get stomach problems, mouth sores, etc. ",4
"I recieved this med in 2 injections for an ectopic pregnancy.  I had no side effects other than PAIN at the injection sites, which lastest about 8 hours.  The pain was somewhat dulled with ice at the injection sites.  Unfortunately, the methotrexate did not work and I needed surgery.  ",1
I have been taking this medication for more than three years and have not had any type of major reaction. I tend to get tired easier and I have developed a sensitivity to eggs and the smell of some plastics (makes me nauseous). I have severe psoriasis due to extreme indoor and environmental allergies and had tried everything from creams to uv therapy with no luck. Methotrexate for me has been a blessing.,5
"Psoriatic Arthritis pain so bad could not sleep, work, etc.  Started injuections 1 time week, and am living as before the condition.  Has been miracle drug for me.",5
"Was on pills for 2 years and now on injections for almost 1 year.  The usual minor side effects with both pill/injections, but I feel great and have been pain free the entire time I've been on this.  Have had to increase my folic acid due to mouth sores.  Have found that taking Biotin daily really helps with the hair thinning/loss!  Take care all!",5
"Was used twice for ectopic pregnancy.  Horrible side effects, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite.  Unfortunately, the option available for this condition other than surgery.",5
"I took the methotrexate pill form but had too many problems with stomach up sets, my dr. turned me over to injections which was very easy to use and quite painless.. but.. now my dr. is changing me to Hummara(sp) since even after 2x's of upping the doseage it doesn't seem to be effective. I've been taking it for almost 1 1/2 years (injection)",3
"I have been taking Methotrexate Inj for over 10 years, I only recently had to up the dose.  I am quite satisfied.",4
I started by taking it orally but it upset my stomach. My docter asked me if I could inject myself instead and I have tolerated it much better.,3
"This treatment takes to long to get out of my system after treatment. Mouth sores come quickly but my troche clears up quickly. Drink lots of fluid when you go through this treatment because if you don't, it could crystalize in your kidneys.",3
"I got horrible mouth sores from this chemo, they would last around a week.  For that whole week I could not eat anything but chicken soup broth, i could not even drink water.   A year after finishing chemo the cancer came back in my lungs.",2
Once you get through the initial side effects the medication is extremely effective.,5
I started the injection because the pills gave so much nausea and gut pain. The injection is no different so if you are thinking it will be it probably won't be. ,2
"I have been on methotrexate injections for over 6 months now.  I have not felt any relief from joint pain and swelling.  Side effects are my hair is falling out by the fistfuls and doctor prescribed Folic acid and I'm on biotin, but it's not helping.  I also developed thrush in the mouth and have bad episodes of itching all over.  I'm going to talk to my doctor about an alternative to this drug.",3
"I have been taking this drug .1 cc's for about 3 years now for my iritis.  Is anyone else out there using it for this condition?  It has been very effective with no side effects, allowing my doctor to wean me completely off the predisolone drops in my eye.  My uncle who has RA also uses this drug and was told that because he is doing the injection as opposed to the pills, it is first absorbed in the blood stream as opposed to the liver and therefore he can still consume alcohol on occasions.  Has anyone else ever heard of this?  I would love to go back to enjoying a few glasses of wine here and there.  Thanks!",4
"have been ill every since starting the injections, can't keep any food in me, severe headaches, extremely tired. Throwing up.",1
"I had gotten the inj in my back side, awful side effect's, I complained to my Dr. she said it was normal 21days later I was rushed to the ER, for emegancey sugery because my tube burst and I was bleeding internaley, I lost my laet tube. this was the worst thing that could have happen. ",1
"I started on MTX oral immediately upon diagnosis of RA in 1990.  Due to stomach ""bleeds"", my doctor put me on the injectable 3 years later.  I took it for the following 12 years.  Side effects I experienced were dry mouth, mouth sores, itchy rash, dry eyes and some lung problems.  The doctor prescribed Folic Acid 5mg per day to clear up the mouth sores.  It worked well.  I put up with the other side effects because they were the lesser of two evils, the other being RA flares.  Because I was on it so long, the doctor took me off it, without a replacement, and I was okay for a while, but just recently (2010), I had the worst flare of my life!  Maybe it's time to return to MTX.  I use acetametiphen with codeine if I feel a lot of pain because it doesn't bother my stomach as much as NSAIDs.  However, I always have to take them with a stool softener because they can be very constipating.  I also have Fibromyalgia & CFS, and have tried Lyrica and Neurontin for those symptoms.  The side effects were horrendous from both ... I was a zombie and couldn't function. My family begged me to get off them because they were affecting our relationships.  I also experienced short term emory loss while on these drugs, a function I've not been able to recoup.  ",3
I used oral MTX for 2 months than switched over to inj.(10cc) for 1 month-today my Dr. told me not to use it for 3 weeks because I had unusally high numbers on my liver panel.  I also get severe headaches and vomiting.  My Dr. assured me I would not lose my hair but it has gotten very thin. ,3
the injections have fewer side effects for me than the pills.  i am now able to take the maximum dose with no nausea or mouth sores.  i take Imuran twice a day along with the weekly shots.  doing much better than even when on Embrel.  saving $$ too!,5
"Im 27 and had an egtopic pregnancy and never hear of some one getting an inj, I had very bad side effects such as the sleepyness, and mood/mental changes I'm a manic depressent have been my whole life and never had a brake dow like this I was never given a side effect sheet nor an other option... Im no lab rat...",3
"I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was fourteen. My doctor prescribed methotrexate, and I had been taking the full dosage for about two years when my doctor halved my dosage. I had been doing really great until recently. I have been having flare-ups more frequently, and my new doctor (I had to switch when I turned eighteen) increased my dosage. She wanted to increase to a full dosage again but my liver isn't doing well so I am stuck at a little above half. I am still having more frequent flare-ups and have talked with my doctor about taking methotrexate with other drugs like Humira or Embrel. As far as symptoms go - I have had painful mouth sores, but taking folic acid had eliminated them. Every time I take methotrexate, I get extremely nauseous and am usually out for the rest of the day. Despite the symptoms, it had been a reliable drug up until recently, unfortunately.",4
"I had a methotrexate injection in my hiney, painful but went away quickly. It brought serious stomach pains especially when you had a bowel movement. My hcg never went up and it took over a month to get below ten. I was administered the shot when my hcg was at 6500, the doctors did not believe it would work and that i would need surgery. Iknow my bod and how well it takes to medicine, and how long it takes to recover from surgery, having a son already. Iwent wtih the shot and dont regret it. it was definetly the more painful way to go but i still have both my tubes. I am nervos of the side effects, since the shot i have lost almost all sense of smell, dont see this in the reading material as being a side effect but figured it was good info to put out there! i also have bad indigestion that has kept up now 3 months after the shot. interested in other side effects ladies may have, please make comments if you have had methotrexate for a ectopic pregnancy.",5
"i had a shot of methotrexate for my second tubular pregnancy, it was that or wait to be scoped again. i am satisfied with it due to the fact i got to keep my only tube,but i don't really understand what it really does to that tube.i am unsure of the future, if i can still have kids or not, but i thank GOD for good health insurance that helps cover invitro!",4
"I have had RA for twenty years and have used Methotrexate for about ten years, both the pills and the injection. The pill did not agree with me, made me sick and my liver was taking a beating.  My doctor switched me over to the injection about 8/9 years ago and I have made major improvement since; however this is with the combination of REMICADE and not by it self. As a result of the RA and the medication I have also developed Sjogren syndrome, which I take Evoxac for. The Methotrexate has contributed to my hair lose, dosage varies from .4cc to .6cc. When I go up to .5/.6 cc my skin starts to breakout in white blotches and itchy pimple like bumps, that when I scratch the skin comes off.  Although my Doctor tells me that I am in remission because I have not had any major flare ups, I tend to differ.  I say this because I am suppose to last six weeks pain free (since this is how often I take REMICADE) but by the second week I start hurting and have to start taking over the counter NSAIDS, by the third week I have to start taking Prednisone and needless to say but by this time, I also look forward and can’t hardly wait for my treatment and two weeks of complete pain free. In addition, I watch what I eat, practice yoga 2/3 times a week (even when I am hurting, it seems to help) and seat in the hot tub. I guess ultimately, the Methotrexate works but only to certain extend; however I do wish I could stop taking it.",4
"This is my second time on Methotrexate.  We finally went back to it after trying Remicade, Humiara, Enbrel among other injectables. They worked for a while but stopped.  This med is much easier to use than the pill form which made me violently ill. My arthritis has tamed down and I have not had a flare since taking methotrexate.  I have expierenced some strange hair loss that has not grown back even between treatment. I do spend most of the day in bed after my injection. Nausea meds help but I am very tired from the med. I also take folic acid with my injection.  If I had to do it over again I would have stuck with methotrexate rather than try all the other injectables.",4
I had a methotrexate injection to terminate a pregnancy in my tubes. The only thing bad I have to say is that I don't feel that the doctors fully explained to me what may happen after the treatment. I had no idea how long it would be in my system. They just said for a while which resulted in me becoming pregnant again and having the pregnancy terminated by the medication that was still in my system.,4
"My wife age 48 now has used this for years now and it is what brought her back, not only from brink of death but kept her out of vegatative state. They had to give her massive doses via iv when she was going downhill fast. It took a while for her to come out of it, but she would not have survived otherwise. She has neurosarcoidosis and hydracephalus. She has been sick since 1986, and has been counted out many times, but has an incredible will to survive and an amazing faith in God. She never complains and just plows ahead, knowing that myself and our (now grown) two kids need her. Maybe she will even become a grandmother next year, but our daughter has illness issues as well and has lost her first two babies, with the third having trouble as well.",5
"This injectible medicine helped me with my red rash on face(across my cheeks&nose) my Crohns felt better when I was on it, AND my RA was better!Now that I'm off of it,my breathing(asthma) feels better. My skin problems are back though. It helped a lot of symptoms/ailments:pain,stiffness red face,diarrhea/pain from Crohn's-but caused serious RAWness in my nose tissues/ & sore mouth= Thrush.",4
I have Crohns. This is the only med so far to keep me in remission. I've been on it for 1 year with no adverse side effects. Today I've noticed sore lumps in my right armpit. I guess I'll have to go to the doctor and find out what they are all about.,5
it was working a litle forme up to now,3
"Methotrexate has worked very well for my RA since starting it over 2 years ago.  I recently started taking injections at the highest dose (1ml). To make the shots easier, I ask for allergy syringes as they are the smallest and work just fine.  I've experienced a lot of hair loss/thinning and find that taking Biotin, 1-2 pills/day (over the counter and cheap!)has really helped. Dry mouth is also a huge side effect for me.  Dr. prescribed Evoxac which works well but makes you sweat alot!  Keep your mouth moist and visit your dentist regularly as consistent dry mouth can very quickly affect your teeth. ",5
injections are somewhat difficult due to finding someone to give them. this med works for a while then you have to up the dose.but good overall.,4
"I shot of methotrexate once a week is easy to give, though hard to remember! ",3
"I was diagnosed with RA in 2001. I was put on Methotrexate 12 weeks ago. I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago. It made me so dizzy I couldn't walk in a straight line, I was afraid to drive the car it was so bad and it isn't even the most severe effect listed for this medication. It did make me feel better otherwise, joints felt better but had to discontinue use because I couldn't function while taking it.",5
"Was on prednisone for a year,and I could get by and barely do my job. Went on methotrexate and after 2 months I had to stop working, and I seem to be the worse I have ever been. Went to the ER today and was,go en an injection of prednisone so I could function.",1
have taken methotrexate for 10 yrs. fining it is less effetive,2
" I was diagnosed with JIA when I was 2 and still struggle with it at age 14. I have used this drug since I was 4, so about 10 years now. I started off with a low dose weekly and started getting higher. Methotrexate never truly worked for me because when ever my doctors said I was in remission and started to go down on my dosage I flared again and again and again. My symptoms were horrible for about  8 of those 10 years I threw up every single time I got the injection. My other symptom was there for the whole time. I would be nauseous for the next 4-6 days and would still have to wake up every morning and go to school no matter how much pain I was in. t was just daily life and you think you would get used to it after 10 years of weekly injections but definitely not. I recently started Humira on top of the methotrexate, after I had my worst and most painful flare in 6 years. Anyway my doctor now think it is a good idea to switch to a different drug called leflunomide. She says it won't make me sick but one of the symptoms is nausea and I'm kinda worried if it is going to work for me. I don't mean to sound like a baby but I don't want to go through the pain of another flare and risk making it worse.",2
"Started seven weeks ago with 10mg for four weeks, then upped to 12.5mg three weeks ago. Results with severe plaques mixed. Lighter plaques clearing up gradually. No major side effects other than abdominal discomfort. Joint pain and stiffness has not worsened as it typically does entering the winter months, but swelling has not reduced and joints are still only 90% functional.",3
"Easy to take once-a-week oral tablets.  No side affects after 2  years on this.  Does not stop inflammation due to psoriatic arthritis entirely - my small joints of hand and feet are still swollen and painful quite often.  Dr. prescribed Meloxicam for control of pain plus D3, folic acid, fish oil. ",3
"It started off fun, but ended in very little fun 3/10",3
"1st week felt fine and it has improved my movement  2nd week I've felt anxious, tired, dizzy and my skin started peeling all over. This is the 2nd time I've tried this drug and it has had the same side effects. I'm hoping to move on to a biologic drug soon. ",4
"I stared out with a low dosage. Was increased to 6. Then all hell broke loose after I would not continue on prednisone. I am now at the max dose, as of last night. 4/8/17. I also take lacorvin calcium the next day to ward off sickness. I also recommend those who have tested negative for RA as I have. Their is a new test out. It's called the Vectra Test. Just a blood draw. Yep positive for RA. It test 12 proteins in your blood vs the RA factor. Highly recommended. be sure your ins will cover it. It's rather expensive. It's amazing what it shows. ",4
"Taken to heal severe psoriasis on my hands. As soon as it cleared, I stopped taking the drug as it left me with loose bowel movements too frequently. I have had fantastic success using essential oils in its place. ",4
I have had no side effects to this drug and it is effectively treating my RA.  My doctor has downgraded my dose to 2.5 mg once a week from 5.0 once a week. I  have blood tests every three months. ,5
"I have psoriatic arthritis but have not been treated with methotrexate, so this review might get deleted.  I do have a comment, though: I urge anyone with inflammatory arthritis to investigate food sensitivities and the ""LEAP"" protocol.  It has greatly improved my arthritis symptoms.",1
"My mum began with 7.5mg/week. After a few days, she hardly eat, her hand shaking most of the time, extremly tired. Three days after the second dose, she had to go hospital in emergency status. ",2
"Taken in conjunction with Enbrel, MTX has been terrific.  No impairing side effects, although my balance is a bit off.",4
"changes in my gait causing calluses on the sides and bottom of my feet, shedding of my skin on my legs, feet,face and hands; knodules, knots and bumps on my nailbeds, bottom of my feet, sores on my tongue (4-5) days after dosage, chills, fever sneezing, coughing,diarrhea, unexpected and lengthly urination, area around nailbeds on all fingers appear to become numb and peel, ring fingers on both hands continue to split with a black vertical line, right side of fingernails disappear and the fleshly part of the finger become hard as nails and have to be filed with emery boards to foster circulation back into the area for feeling to return and real nail growth begins,; diarrhea, fever, sneezing, coughing, chills lasts 4-5 days after dosage",4
"When I take this medicine in tablets or injection, I experienced nausea, vomiting etc. I am not interested to use it but it is necessary for me to take injection of 25 mg once a week as advised by the doctor.",2
I wish so much that I could have been treated immediately for RA with Methotrixate but I could not get in to see the RA specialist in a timely manner. It is very effective. I developed RA after having a knee replacement and I believe that the replacement was a trigger for my immune system. I did have hair loss and now it is growing back even though I am still on methotrixate. I do not have other side effects but may be developing mouth sores. Now I have excellent medical care and am on Medicare.,4
"Diagnosed with Graves Disease, PA with psoriasis,Sjogrens with Lupus recently added. Went on this drug with hydroxychloroquine (Plaquinil) generic. Within 2 weeks had arthritic knot severely distorting a toenail and pain with every step. Quit the hydroxy but stayed on methotrexate to heal my hands. Months later I learned the met prevented antibiotics from working on an infection and could have an adverse effect on tendons, explaining other pain. That was 2 years ago. I recently had distorted nail removed and don't plan to resume taking either arthritis medication. After enduring a battery of tests, I couldn't see more than 2 areas on x-rays that showed arthritis burls, one looks like a candy corn wedge in my thumb. Now, when I feel a painful lump rising, I rub as hard as I can, as often as possible and it goes away. Somehow, I suspect the solution lies in reducing the inflammation. Think I'll check with mother nature and see what's available that won't poison me.",2
I have no reaction to this drug. I have not lost or gained weight. I have not lost any of my hair. I have been nauseated a few times and stomach burning if I don't take the medication with milk or food. ,4
"Overall MTX has worked very well for me.  Been on it for almost 10 years and no bad side effects or anything else.  Feel great, good energy with no flare-ups like when i was taking plaquenil. very satisfied, and will continue taking due to excess effects of not taking it.",5
"Makes me terrible sick, cannot eat, gas, cannot keep anything in stomach. We are going to try another medicnine to see how that does. I have been living on jello, crackers, broth. Getting dehydrated. Bad",4
The pill is killing me the shot is great no stomach pain,3
"Getting ready to increase taking 4 also, taking humira, methotrexate, prednisone. Also tried plaq, sulfaalzine side effects on both had to be taking off waiting for relief. Have hair loss",3
This medication was for my psoriasis and the red flacky patches have not cleared up at all.It was also for my severe feet pain with my psoriatic arthritis and that has not helped.,1
Taking a very small dose (2.5 mg).  I've taken it for three weeks and have come down with a very bad rash on both my legs above the ankle and into the foot.  I'm not sure it is from this medication but I have not done anything else different.  I read that a rash is a bad allergic response.  Can't call the doctor as it's Memorial Day weekend and HATE to go to the emergency room.  Has anyone ever had a rash from this drug?  Thanks.,3
"I took methotrexate pills but they upset my stomach.  I switched to injectable methotrexate and have used for about 6 years.  It has worked well for me. I also take Naproxen.  Sometime I have intestinal discomfort, but GI doctors says there are no apparent problems.  I have gradually increased methotrexate dosage over  the years to keep RA symptoms at bay.  Currently at .8 cc.  Seems like it takes a long time to get over a cold when taking methotrexate, so I sometimes stop taking it for a couple of weeks when I'm sick.",4
"I have been on methotrexate for 9 years!  I rarely have any flare-ups and can't believe how well it has worked for me.  I hope it continues.  Sometimes feel a little nauseous when I take the pills but reduced to 7 pills from 8, once a week and this has helped.  (Take 4 in the morning after breakfast and 3 after dinner).  So far, so good!",5
Although I really felt a difference in the month that I took this med (w/plaquenil) the HAIR loss was too much for me! So now I'm going to try sulfasalazine...,4
"I was diagnosed with Scleroderma (CREST) 4 years ago.  My rheumatologist wanted me to start methotrexate last spring after the first two months I stopped taking it on my own because I didn't like the side effects.  However, after the summer had passed I told my rheumatologist that I had stopped and he pretty much begged to try again so I have been on it for the past three months, I feel weak the day after and have had an increased amount of fatigue.  I take folic acid to help with mouth soars and it has helped.  Overall, I cannot say that this medicine doesn't help at all but I am still trying to decide whether the side effects are worth staying on the drug.  I am young and just starting off my professional career and the methotrexate isn't helping in the work department, there are times I cant work because of the side effects (i.e. fatigue, nausea, stomach pain)",3
"Took 6 months to take effect but Ive been in remission for about 18 months. Personally, it's been a wonder drug.  Give it time before you decide on a biologic. 25mg once a week.",5
"it has lots of unpleasant side effects but I will take them gladly mtx makes my ra tolerable, I take mtx, humira, prednisone and pain med this is the best med combo so far, if I could stay on mtx same dosage and dr not holding it because of bad labs I think my quality of life would improve more but its not always an option since labs are a factor and mtx causing low numbers Nd blood transfusions",3
"I have sjogren's disease and was first put on Plaquenil.  I had terrible itching on blurred vision; so my rheumatologist put me on MTX, now by injection.  This condition has been exacerbated by arthritis and bursitis. I see no improvement in joint pain or fatigue.  Not sure if it really works for me. I take a small dose, .40, & folic acid.  I hurt all the time!",2
I have been taking this drug along with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone for more than 5 years and function normally. On occasion I may have a flare in different parts of my body.  They seem to move around but generally last a day or so and a hot shower really helps.  Lately I have been good and my RA doc wants me to cut back on the med but I am afraid.  If it works why fix it.  Down the road side effects are a concern but I try to get my liver and kidneys checked every 3 - 4 months,5
"I've been taking methotrexate for about 10 years now and it does help my RA, but it makes me feel awful. I used to throw up because how bad it tasted(after awhile you will start to) and I still have to deal with  horrible stomach aches, making me feel fatigued or like I'm going to throw up, and etc.",4
I have just been diagnosed with RA and with Sjogrens as secondary.  Reading these reviews is very scary.  Just got my meds today and will start them tomorrow. This along with Plaqueil and Prednisone for now.  Feeling very overwhelmed not knowing how the meds will affect me. It amazes me how many people don't really grasp the amount of pain that comes with RA.  I suppose I will update at a later time with results.  Good ones I hope.  ,3
"Currently on MTX for almost 2 years. It has given me a quality of life that I used to have.  I used to sit in my recliner most of the time but now I am able to walk some and the pain has decreased significantly. A couple of months ago I began to feel some pain again so I am thinking that it may not be working as well on me so my Rhuemy is going to switch me on to Otleza. I know people who have been on this for 10 years but also take another drug to go along with it. I take it at night so very minimal side effects, if any.  Highly recommend! ",4
"Had been on it for about 4 years started to get side effects so stopped taking it for a year and a half felt better but Dr wanted me back on got side effects after 3 injections headaches bruises, weight gain ( lost 50 lbs after I stopped taking it) gained back 4 lbs after 3 injections decided I was not taking it any more will live with the pain for as long as possible am trying other natural ways instead no more poison in my body",3
"I have been taking this medication for 3 months,  my scalp is much better, but my legs are not clearing up that good.  I still get the burning and itching.  no side effects yet.",3
No side effects yet with this medicine.  It along with the plaquinil have helped my husband regain get some strength back in his hands. He has been able to open bottles and milk jugs and such without help and has have only been on this since Feb of this year.,5
"After two doses of 10mg, I was hospitalized for three days for persistent headaches and difficulty breathing which resulted in needing oxygen.",1
"Has reduced my RA pain, swelling, and nerve issues (foot numbness) by probably 75%.  Now I'm also on Humeria and am having even better results.",5
Effective but with consequences.  My immune system is greatly weakened.,4
"I have only taken my 6th dose.  This drug I understand it to help stop the RA.  I will be adding another injectable to help with the swelling and pain.  In the meantime I am taking Tramadol to help with some pain.  I have pain all over, hands, shoulders, elbows, ankles, knees, hips.  It's crazy, but I am learning as much as I can about RA so I am informed and make good choices.",4
"Drug is helping with pain, however suffering with swollen ankles. Has anyone had swollen ankles with or without the drug with RA? Could be heart failure, but don't want to hear that although I am getting tested for it soon. Had swollen ankles then a flare in left ankle/foot then one in the right. Doctor increased Methotrexate which helped flare but ankles still swollen but not as bad. Would appreciate knowing if anyone else with RA has had swollen ankles? I hate to think it is heart failure!!!",4
"have stopped methotrexate for two months and my skin has improved. and still improving, and is getting thicker and not so easy to bruise and bleed...",3
Suffered from severe Bone marrow suppression after taking this drug for about two weeks.,4
I have been taking it for severe psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis for 4 years. The first year was great.  Both my skin and the arthritis went away almost immediately but started coming back after about a year.  Now my skin is worst then ever and the arthritis is coming back.  I'm going to be asking my Doctor to change me up to something else.,3
No stiffness,4
I keep having skin adhesion reactions to this medication. My Doctor are saying is it herpes simplex 2.,2
Been diagnosed with RA haven't started this drug yet. Have a script. Side effects scares me. Been taking glucosamine with chrondriton for 5 weeks and a dose pack of prednisone. Been off of prednisone for a week. Feel some tightness in wrists and left ankle otherwise feel fine. I have a colonoscopy scheduled later this month (routine) never had one before. I'm going to wait until I have it. Have an apt next month for bio identical hormone replacement. May wait until I start them also. I also have hashimotoes autoimmune disease. Genetic. No one in my family has RA that I am aware of. I don't want the RA to progress so I will try this medication and hope the side effects are not as bad as I think they will be. Then I'll give it a different rating.,1
"Woke up with terrible pain in all joints, worst in ankles & feet. Referred to rheumy but original tests neg. Thought to have osteo. Had steroid shots in fingers & wrists so I could could continue working.  Had good results, but pain eventually got worse all over and was re-tested & dx with RA.  Went on prednisone & metho, felt great after a few wks.  But then she weaned me off prednisone as she said I could not stay on it. I hoped metho would do the trick as I did not want to go on a biologic. Finally had so much pain I relented and went on Humira.  I did ok on it for a year, but then she said it was failing as my joints were not going down like the should, especially some fingers.  So switched to Cimzia.  Been on it for 1 1/2 yrs now and so far good.  I do 2 injections in legs once a month, which I like better than the Humira.  Take 3 1mg folic acid/day, 10 mg/wk metho and get blood checked every 8 weeks.  I exercise and am able to resume all my normal activities that I could not do before. So I am pleased.  I do think about the long term side effects, but I have such improved quality to my life now, that I just figure life is too short to live in pain if you don't have to.  I figured if I didn't at least try something I would never know and I can always stop if it doesn't work.  I had a lot of anxiety at first, but I am over that now, which I realize now probably made my pain worse.   I am hoping for the best and just trying to live a full life the best I can. Still work part time for now.  Try to eat better, think positively & exercising really helps me feel better.  Yoga is great, wish I had discovered it a lot earlier in life.  I wish everyone with RA the best. ",4
"After 7 months started noticing my elbow/arm nodules were getting bigger.  Also felt a lump starting on lumbar spine/coccyx.  Doctor kept saying just a cyst on coccyx do nothing.  I kept saying getting bigger. I insisted on a  MRI - this huge lump is now 6""x 3""and the surgeon says it is Rheumatoid Nodule.  I read Methotrexate can be cause of nodules or certainly makes them bigger.  Folic Acid too makes nodules bigger.  Be real careful of any lumps visual places and internal.  Have quit this dangerous stuff",1
Sick exhausted most of the time. Stopped taking because it wasn't working. Would rather have pain than spend day in bed sleeping ,1
FINE,5
"I have moderate to severe RA pain. Have been taking this for about 6 weeks (8 pills, once a week - with folic acid and hydroxychloroquine & 4 lortabs a day) - the ""nodules"" on my fingers are completely gone. The daily worsening of symptoms has stopped. I'm sleeping thru the night, not needing the lortab at night. Only side effect I see is a little more sleepiness the day I take mtx. The rest of the week I have more energy. I am able to go for 1/2 mile walks, and occasionally work out on nordic-trak - that i haven't been able to do for a couple of years. Rashes i've had for years (unrelated to RA) are going away. Still waiting for more easing of pain. So far - so good.",4
I have taken this drug for about a year and find it most effective.  there have been very few and mild side effects. (minor mouth sores) I started with 2 pills per week and worked my way up to 4 before I got relief. I can now function almost normally with little or no pain.,5
"Dr isn't sure I have RA, but terrible pain and swelling from osteoarthritis, so he is trying this. Causes my mouth, tongue and lips to be sore, headaches, neck stiffness, some hair loss.  I also have trouble going to sleep even tho I am exhausted almost all of the time. My hands are as swollen nor painful as they were, but cortizone injections work just as well or better. Have had one blood test to check liver. Find out in 2 days when I see dr. Been on mtx and folic acid for 5 wks now. Not sure it is worth it. Rather have shots, but will stick with it for a while longer if liver functions are okay.  ",4
"Been taking Methotrexate for 3 months and have been deathly ill for three weeks of them. Nausea, vomiting, severe stomach pain, fatigue, hair loss, diarrhea, headache, fever, and just let me die and get it over-with! Will never take this again!!! Feels like slow death!",1
have not really noticed a big change in pain level or fatigue,3
"I have dark poop since yesterday, what can that be?",2
The only concern I have is my hair is thinning.  I have stopped the methotrexate for now.,5
the medicine is not relieving my syptoms and causing me to loss my hair.,2
I have Ankylosing Spondylitis and take Humira 40mg.injections my arthritis was diagnosed in 2004.My dr put me on methotrexate last month when my A.S. levels increased. Since I toke my first dose of four 2.5mg once a week. My symptoms have gotten so much worse. Every inch of my spine is imflamed. I have made an appt. to see my dr. but when your given a drug it should help you not hurt you! ,1

sick for 36 hrs after taking. ,3
i dont like the taste of this med make me vomiting I stop it and now my rheumatoid get worse,3
"I was really scared to start this med due to everything I have read about it. Very thankful for those with positive reviews I closed my eyes and took the pills and waited for the bad things to happen. Was not really to bad, somewhat sick to my stomach and a bit nervous on the day of taking the pills (8 pills once a week 2.5mg) and the day after. I started taking them in Dec.2013 Dr also added Folic Acid 1000 mg & Leucovorin 5mg for the day of and after taking the methotrexate. I am having a problem with hair loss that I was hoping would stop as my system gets use to the drug, it has not stopped yet & it has been 8 months. If anyone knows what to do about this problem please let me know.  Good Luck and God Bless everyone trying to deal with RA. ",4
"It has stopped any progression of rheumatoid arithritis as far as I know.  I guess I would be considered in remission.  Do have ""occasional"" very mild side affects on the morn. after I take the drug.",5
I ended up in hospital with liver failure  Once changed to different treatment it took several months to have near normal liver function results,1
100 percent pain free in 3 months. ,5
Helped me tremendously combinded with Remicade Infusions,5
"Had worsening reaction each week until fourth week when severe reactions occurred. Inability to urinate or sweat day after taking four pill weekly dose even though large amount of water consumed. Nausia, disoriented, low blood sugar. Doctor said he had not heard of some of these effects although they are listed as possible,except for low sugar ",2
"This has worked well for me, but the results are better in my small joints (e.g. hands, wrists, toes) than in my knees, hips and ankles. ",4
"This has been my  saver for over 30 years.  I did have non-hodgins Lymphoma in  2002 & lung cancer in 1988.  I still take methotrexate because, I believe, it is the only thing (other than bilateral ankle replacements) that has stopped the pain.  ( I am now on maintenance dose of 1 or  2 a week.)  ",5
"I have been on this medicine for quite sometime. Recently I was taken off for surgery & boy did I have a flair up. The side effects are tiredness, nausea, and hair loss. Now back on it hopefully flair will subside.",3
"It seems to make me very groggy and all I want to do is sleep after taking my weekly dose of 3, 2.5mg tabs. The Prednisone has helped greatly all along, wondering if maybe its all that I need to take. ",2
"The pain has been controlled after 2 weeks of use and stays controlled! Gardening again without difficulty! Almost a miracle as biologics worked fairly well but not completely. MD has me on the 2 tabs every 12 hours x 3 times per week. There are a few side effects like nausea for a few days each week and insomnia but in light of being almost completely pain free, these are not that much of a problem.",5
My mother-in-law had to stop taking this drug because of high enzymes in blood test and an MRI with a shadow on her liver. She is now experiencing fluid on her stomach and bloating which makes her uncomfortable. Has anyone experienced these symptoms after taking this drug? There is not much out there about possible liver damage.    ,4
"Just started taking this, 2 doses so far.  Not sure if the pain I'm experiencing is because I stopped my naproxen the same day I started this. Also I'm 2 weeks late on my menstrual period, does this drug also affect that or am I starting menopause? No other side effects except the pain and achiness..waiting patiently to feel better!",1
"I started on methotrexate five months after being diagnosed with RA when I was only getting worse on plaquinel. This medication has done nothing for me but give my mouth sores, make my hair fall out and give me heartburn. ",1
"Diagnosed with RA in Jan. 2010 at age 62 (all of my joints literally became painful overnight - never had any discomfort before).  Started on 25 mg of Methotrexate once a week plus high doses of Prednisone until the pain got under control.  Have continued with 25 mg MTX each week and 5 mg of Prednisone for the past couple of years.  Currently weaning off Prednisone since it may have caused my bone density to drop, and RA dr. has added 400 mg of Plaquenil daily (saying anyone rarely can get by on just MTX) and wanted to get that into my system before the pain might return.  I'm hoping that my dosage of MTX may be decreased some in the future since it sounds like no one seems to be on that high a dosage.  I've been totally pain free for at least 2 years and feel great (but worry about the side effects of taking these drugs).",5
effective. condition improved,4
"I've been on Methotrexate for over 10 yrs. Worked great for 9..this past yr has been horrible. Didn't put it together till I had to stop taking it for a week before a procedure. I was nauseated to the point of vomiting for the first 48 hrs. I was tired, sleepy, had floaters really bad, Palpatations, dry mouth, intestinal problems and other stuff. When I didn't take it I felt so much better. Now after 4 weeks the RA pain is hitting with a vengence. Everything hurts. Dr. has offered the injection just not sure if I want to go thru everything again. I am sure there is other stuff out there. I can't even think about being that sick again. If it wasn't for the severe pain I'm going thru right now I wouldn't even consider the thought of taking it again. I don't know what it has done to my insides. I do have erosions on my stomach lining which I think the Metho. caused. I have also HAD really bad pain under my right rib which makes me think it was causing my gall bladder to go bad since Metho it noted for doing damage. Since I haven't taken the Metho I haven't even had that pain. Like someone else said you have to pick your poison. Is it worth it? Does it Work? Do you feel good and have some quality of life while taking it? I was fine till now. Now its decision time. Hopefully the dr. will have some kind of plan when I see her in a few weeks.",4

"I have been on MTX for about four yrs.  Compared to some of the others will just state ""scares me less.""  After reading a couple of these reviews, left wondering why am I taking this?  My side effects are hair loss, mouth sores, headaches from hell, on the toliet and in the shower constantly, I go from cold to hot in 90 seconds, (not hormonal), pain is still there maybe even worse, breathing is troubled, I am always fatigued, nausea, bruising & eye pain.  It has helped with swelling.  My disease is complicated but then again any immune issue is not simple.  If only my pain & fatigue would be gone for a day I would be so happy.  I sometimes feel that I would be suffice with the array of dreadful faults of having ""SLE"" if just for a day be pain free!",3
"On my 2nd dose of 6 tablets (2.5mg) once a week, along with Folic Acid. Diagnosed with RA in June 2011, after severe pain & flare up requiring emergency visits. First given Arthrotec then Celebrex. Next 2 prednisone shots in my shoulder with no relief. Then given Co-meloxicam & percocets for inflamation & pain. After MRI's on both shoulders Aug 2012, given cortisone shots in both... much relief! Then knees & feet started & both shoulders ramping up again, so now starting Metho, hope it works. No side effects as yet, but no real relief either in feet, knees or shoulders. Still aching, painful, swelling. Having blood work every 2 weeks for for 6 weeks, then once a month til next appt with Rheumy in July. Scary drug, but with no side effects yet.. I will continue & hope for the best.  ",3

"THE DOCTOR INCREASED MY DOSAGE TO 8 PER WEEK I HAVE NO PAIN, OR VERY LITTLE ONCE IN AWHILE AS OPPOSTED TO WHEN I STARTED.  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I HAVE LOST HAIR. MY HAIR WAS PRETTY THICK TO START WITH, BUT NOW I HAVE  SMALL BALD SPOTS. THIS DOES BOTHER ME BUT NOTHING COMPAIRED TO THE PAIN I WAS ENDURING.",4
"Exhausted and aching from head to foot, my dr. figured out my sed rate had pushed up and up...rheumatoid arthritis. From just a few mtx to 10 mtx @ week for two years, combined with folic acid. Though the pain continued, it was lower than before. WE added plaquenil within the past three months, but overall, pain is at about a 4. I'm happy - no serious side effects as described by others.

It was the ONLY medicine that helped the extreme swelling of my hands and fingers which was causing me tremendous pain and no real use of my hands.  It took very little time for the medicine to be effective.  I realize this is a very strong medicine and I wish I did not have to take it, but as of now it is the only option for me.  I worry about my liver, but take monthly blood tests and go to my Rheumatologist every 3 months.  At first I was taking Folic Acid with it but then was switched to a type of Calcium that I take 12 hours afer the Methotrexate ...this is supposed to take away the toxicity of the Methotrexate.",5
no help,2
"I have been taking Methotrexate since October 2012 for RA, Lupus and Sjogrens and my doctor and I are seeing very positive results.  However, today she increased my dosage from 6 pills per week to 8 pills per week because of inflammation in my hands.  My pain has gone from a 10 to a 3.  I did have a few mouth sores in December and my doctor increased the folic acid to 2mg per day and the sores went away within 5 days. The fatigue for a few days after taking the pills is bearable and the nausea is mild and tolerable.    I am very satisfied with the results.  My doctor is always available and she returns my emails and/or phone calls right away.  I love my Rheumatologist and recommend her highly.",4

"Unlike other RA patients, my RA abruptly slammed me with pain and weird and uncomfortable muscle sensations; and weakness in my hips, legs, shoulders and arms.  PCP prescribed Nasonex (which I didn't take), temple artery biopsy, blood tests, Percocet and prednisone to keep me going while waiting to see my rheumatoid doc who gradually reduced the prednisone and prescribed additional blood work and a TB test. Methotrexate became my salvation once it kicked in (about a month and a half) and ended any need for percocet. The RA is now well controlled with seven pills taken on one day each week plus 3 gr daily of folic acid (to help keep my hair anchored).  Additionally, I take calcium and vit D. My doctor is magnificant and approachable! Since I'm concerned that I'll max out on methotrexate I persuaded him to reduce my dosage of methotrexate but symptoms came back and blood work confirmed that the inflammation was up. If I weren't on a immunosuppressant, I'd get a shingles shot.  I'm very happy with my situation!",5
"While I found that it took care of the pain quite well, the most immediate side effect (mouth ulcers) were present within 48 hours of starting the drug.

Was taking it on Friday night so Mondays were awful. This week I took it Thursday night so I can feel crappy on Sunday instead.",4
"After taking this drug for one month, six pills every day,  my hands didn't hurt as much, but I started to develop severe side effects.  Internal bleeding, surface pressure hemorrages on my skin, digestive bleeding, eye problems, hearing loss, and I developed a heart murmur.  The doctor who gave me the med told me none of these problems had anything to do with the drug.

"I was diagnosed with RA in Feb 2012 after years of all-over aching and tiredness. Was also diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and polymyalgia. Was put first on six, then eight of these once a week along with daily predisone.  Nearly six months later there is little to no improvement, except for my skin conditions.  For this, it's worked wonders --though I can't tell whether it's this or the prednisone that's working. But there was only a small improvement in the tiredness and aching, and none in the swelling.  In fact, the swelling is worse.  I also developed headaches and canker sores bad enough to affect my speech.  Am going to insist on being taken off this med because I'm swelling up all over in spite of being on furosemide for a leaky heart valve. Little improvement, terrible side effects--I figure there must be something else that will keep my skin issues in line.",2
Have just been diagnosed with RA. Have only been taking MTX for 3 weeks. I take 12.5 mg once a week and Prednisone and Mobic daily. I take the MTX with lunch and Take my other pills with dinner and that seems to do the trick for the upset stomach. So far I have good movement but the pain is still there. Dr. will up my MTX dose next month so we will see how that works.,3
just started taking meds...i am scared of lowering my immune system...but i am tired of the pain and skin lesions...will let you know after i've been on meds for a while,1
"After starting a regimen of Enbrel injections weekly, methotrexate daily and low doses of Prednisone I wondered what happened to my healthy body?  RA just appeared out of nowhere, BAM! It took the Enbrel 5 months to kick in but when it did I felt really good. I used my hands a lot as a Barista and I was pain free. However the Methotrexate was awful, I couldn't walk up or down stairs without being out of breath. A trip to the mail box resulted in the same affect.  I would find myself sitting in my car on the way to work taking deep breaths just to feel like I had enough air in my lungs. I am very active and this drug left me feeling absolutely helpless. Sort of like a fish out of water...panting and gasping for air. I finally told my Dr. that I refused to take it anymore so after 5 months I quit.  It was like an immediate change in my breathing ability, I can walk, hike, swim and I have no breathing problems anymore.  I also noticed that when I ate a meal I would be in the bathroom almost within 20-30 minutes due to diarreha. I didn't realize Methotrexate was causing it but as soon as I quit taking it that problem went away also.  I still have RA and am still searching for the right drug that works great for me at a price I can afford.  If Medicare would pay for 100% of my Enbrel injections I would still be on it.  I am now traveling the rocky road of infusion drugs.  Started on Remicade, had 2 infusions and had an allergic reaction.  Have now had 1 infusion of Actemra but have not had any relief that I can notice from it.  Was put on 25 mg of Prednisone to control the swelling and pain that went rampant after they took me off Remicade due to the allergic reaction.  Two days on Prednisone and I started feeling so much better. Pain levels went from a 12 on the scale of 1-10 down to a 1-2. It's a miracle drug but not without many downsides also.",1
"this medication effected me a lot. it stopped tcell production and left me with no immune system. it also made my bones and body hurt pretty badly on most days but not so severe on others. overall it really worked and was the only drug that has been able to treat my condition but it is a severe, strong drug that can only be taken for a short amount of time!",5
I have been taking this drug for 10 years (on and off) and find it to be most effective on controllong my RA.  I do however still get large knodules - it hasn't controlled them.,3
Have taken 2 doses and having trouble with constipation. Is this normal?  Have been diagnosed with Crest Syndrome.,2
not breaking out with sores from discord lupes,5
"I have been on mtx for the past year, and it has greatly reduced the symptoms of my lupus.  However, it makes me very sick.  I only take 8mg but I am still wiped out for several days.  It works, but it's not fun to use.  Btw, for all other users, I find that eYing foods with a lot of sulfur makes the side effects worse.   ",4
"I have only been on this drug one week, 3 pills) so too early to accurately judge results.",5
"The MTX makes me sick for about four days after taking 15MG on friday night , I get to feeling better about Wed. but I will start it all over the next Fri night. The MTX is helping me , however I am looking for something to take so I can feel better after taking the MTX.",4
Hasn't really done a thing to stoo the progression or help reduce the pain,2
Diagnosed in 11/08.  Started on Prednisone and took for 8 months.  Then started MTX.  Some nausea and weight loss but it has helped.  Also take tramadol for breakthrough pain.  Would recommend taking 1200 mg of calcium and 800 of vitamin D because of recent diagnosis of osteoporosis..from RA? or from Prednisone?  Get of steroids as fast as you can and start prevention of osteoporosis.  MTX has so far benefited me.,4
"Diagnosed with RA Feb 2012 after 3 months of flare-up and pain. Went to bed and woke up with it after no previous signs of joint discomfort, it was like it came on overnite. Been on MTX for 2 months. Side effects have been mouth sores and nausea even after taking folic acid daily. Dr prescribed Leucovorin Calcium, taken 12 hours after taking MTX. Has help with mouths sores but not nasea and headache. Still would take Mtx than to have RA flare-ups",5
"First took this 8 years ago..went off...went back on 3 years ago...and back on recently.  This time however, I developed horrible mouth sores on my palate.  Upped my folic acid and used a peroxide mouth rinse, took about 2 weeks but they are finally gone.  Did notice some hair loss, but not enough to be concerned.",4
"I have been on methotrexate previously with success, then went into remission and now i am back on the med",4
I have been on Methotrexate for 3 months and feel 100% better. Hardly any pain at all/ I take 1 mg of folic acid every day,5
"I have been taking MTX since 1984.  I also take Celebrex for pain and inflammation.  Dr. took me off MTX so I could get pregnant in 1985, went right back on after giving birth. I don't know what condition I would be in without MTX.  My rhuematologist tried giving me Remicade which only made me worse.  I have had RA since I was 3 yrs old, I turn 50 this yr!  ",5
Seemed like it took a long time to achieve results but I have been taking itfor years without side effects.,4
"I was diagnosed with RA in Oct. 2011.  I was put on Plaqunil 20mg.  I took it for 5 days and became deathly ill.  I had watery diarrhea and was uninating constantly.  I could hardly eat or get out of bed.  Needless to say after losing 14# in 5 days, the doctor took me off of it and put my on MTX.  I just took my 10th dose.  Started off with 10mg/week and am now up to 15mg/week.  I've had breathing problems so I keep an O2 meter.  Usually my O2 level is at 95 and now it won't reach 90.  I get calf cramps the first couple days after I take it and terrible headaches running up the back of my neck.  I thought it was sinus but I think it's the meds.  I can't get out of bed either.  It's like I'm drugged.  But then at night, I can't get to sleep.  In spite of faithfully  taking it, I had a terrible flare up last week for four days that kept me in bed.  I'm concerned about my lungs and am contacting my doctor this week to discuss this.  It's especially bad when I'm on a plane as they only adjust the O2 level to 10,000 feet.  I can't go on like this as I can hardly walk 100 ft.",3
"I had a reaction to Methotrexate which prescribe to wean down my prednisone dosage.  I ended up in respitory failure and not permanent lung damage.  I understand this is a very rare reaction, but life threatening.  Still on Predisone and Enbrel.  ",1
"I've been taking metho since spring of 2011.  Started out with 4 (2.5 mg) pills a week.  Had a little nausea at first with that, but then no side effects. Then dr put me up to 6/week.  Had more side effects but that was months ago and now have little to none. I also take 1mg of folic acid a day to help with the side effects.  Mostly I might feel a little nauseated later on in the day, and have a slight headache.  Next day I'm good as new.  I used to hurt too bad to wear shoes with any kind of heel, but now I can wear my dressier heels again.  It's a miracle to me!  My hands are not hurting hardly at all any more.  I can get dressed in the morning and work as well as I used to.  It's definitely worth trying to get relief!  I read reviews on here before I took it and a lot of them scared the crap out of me and I didn't want to take it.  I don't know why some ppl are having such bad reactions to it, but I have reactions to everything I take and I've been fine.  So I definitely urge any metho newbies to give it a try and not let all the negative reviews scare you away.  If it works for you, it's totally worth a few little side effects!!!",5
"The medication helps to a certain extent, however i feel like i canot cope due to nauseau and indigestion i feel after consuming the tablet and have to counteract the effect with anti nauseau tablets.",3
"Having known I had positive rheumatoid factor for years, and psoriasis, and ""degenerative arthhritis"" of the spine since my 40s, I was finally diagnosed several years ago at age 61. Although I didn't achieve remission, and the associated diarrhea took a while to stop, I have built up to 5 2.5 mg tablets once a week, and have no problems. My pain is managed with Vicodin twice a day, and I'v learned to rest. It has remarkably improved my mobility, since I was walking with a cane after a knee operation that wasn't healing correctly. No-one should try the new biologics before trying methotrexate first.Heavily advertised, I feel they are over hyped and dangerous, unless nothing else has helped. I can't get the shingles vaccine since it's a live virus, and I have to be careful about cat bites and scratches from my 3 cats, which are very infrequent. Sometimes they've required antibiotic therapy. However, my overall satisfaction is very good. You'll get over your total germ paranoia, and the quality of your life will vastly improve. ",4
"I haven't had any new areas of pain flares but if I resume activities that involve a joint/joints, then the damaged ones will flare up, ie. kayaking, my hands will flare after using the padles for a few hrs.",3
"It does cause a sense of weakness...and drowsiness..I was unable to walk or move arms before this drug and combination of three others (predisone folic acid also taken) I wouldve died or been in a nursing home without these meds ""the benefits definately outweigh the risks""",5
I just started taking this drug last week. I didn't want to take it due to possible side effects. After much research decided to give it a try. Really tired of the pain and swelling. I'm also on predisone and an anti-inflamatory diet which do help. Will report back in a couple weeks. ,3
hair loss and sore muscles,3
"This drug has reduced my symptoms down to very little. I take it once a week and start to feel a few random symptoms in my hands, wrists, shoulder, hip, etc. when it's time to take the next week's dosage. ",4
loss of hair is rather difficult to deal with!,4
It makes me very sick for about 3 days with diarhea and fatigue--even after 20 years of use.,3
"This drug worked great for me. I had nausea and diarreah the first night after the shot and nothing since then. They found my tubal pregnancy at 6 weeks, no heart beat but I had really high HCG levels. It worked well I did not have to have surgery. 10 weeks later and we are still waiting for my hormones to reach to zero. ",5
I get severe mouth ulcers and I'm unable to eat.,2
"I was treated for several cuts and abrasions, in an emergency room, after a fall onto a concrete driveway (May 19th).  Before being released, I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. I had been in the hospital six months earlier for 4 days.  During that stay I was hooked up to several ""devices,"" including at least 2 days on a heart monitor. There was no indication of afib at that time.  Just prior to my fall on May 19th, I was put on Methotrexate by a Rheumatologist - this was on May 11th.  This WebMD site notes that you should ""Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat...""  I did later, by letter, copying both my family doctor and cardiologist, as well as the Rheumatologist that prescribed it.  Only my family doctor responded with a ""...it could have contributed..."" The Rheumatologist and cardiologist were both silent!  Later tests by the cardiologist confirmed that my afib was not a result of any heart related problem (2 tests: 2 wks. on a heart monitor, and a test called nuclear stress test).  None of the three doctors seem to want to address this issue.  So far as they are concerned, my afib was caused by ""other factors.""",3
"7 months after pregnancy, lupus symptoms flared. No relief from NSAIDs. Apprehensive about taking Methtrexate but rhematologist felt it would help with my symptoms. It has helped a lot with my pain. Still have achiness especially the day before the next dosage. Only side effect is hair loss which I had prior to starting medication. No nausea. ",5
not sure about treatment - sed rate went from 79 to 31 to 33.  lately feeling nausea and headaches - not sure if it's this or other meds,3

"My 87 year old Mother just found out this drug has destroyed her lungs. Pulmonary Fibrosis. She used this drug for 20 some odd years to treat her RA. It worked great, kept her flares under control wonderfully. However, now she is on Oxygen, and is going to die a long, and painful death. None of her twelve assorted Doctors told her of this side effect. ""Pick your own poison""......",5
"I have been taking MTX for 22 years. Initially, my diagnosis was Lupus, but over the years has been changed to RA (I know, weird). It has been a MIRACLE DRUG for me. Before, I could barely walk, but w/in ~2 weeks I was up walking! My son was 2 at the time, so it was hard not being able to walk! Each drug acts differently in each person. I had tried other ones before MTX that did not help. My doc added Enbrel to my regime 2 years ago. I am not too keen on taking Enbrel and don't take it regularly. I have NOT noticed any difference in the way I feel, but my x-rays do show that I have not had any additional deterioration in my joints since I started taking it. I also take OTC Folic Acid 1000mg/day. My doc says I have been taking MTX longer than any of his other pts. I understand there is risk, but for me, as I said, it has been a miracle drug. So far my blood tests have been good; no kidney/liver problems at all, so I will continue to take it as long as I can.",5

It makes me feel sick to my stomach and all I want to do is lay around.,1
"I have been taking methotrexate for about 20 yrs. I had both severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I have bone deformities in all fingers and toes, which occured before I started methotrexate.  This drug gave me my life back. It also works on my other autoimmune diseases; celiac and a severe blistering disease, plus others. I still have side effects like mouth sores etc. but it is well worth the trade off.  There are alot of newer drugs  now that I haven't tried. It doesn't help much with my osteoarthritis.  I am in a wheel chair most of the time due to pain from the osteo deteriation, but I have full use of my hands, something I didn't have before and I have very little psoriasis. If for some reason I have to stop using it for even a week after I should have taken my shot and get very ill since all of my diseases flare at once. It takes sometimes takes months to get everything under control again. I would definitely recommend trying it. ",5
just getting starte no nothing,1

i found out that i had RA apprx 1 yr ago had to say it took 6 months to have it kick in but i was only taking 4 a week up to 5 now seems to be working very seldem do i have to take anything else for pain. but i don't like the side effects that i have been reading about.,4
"I have been taking this medication for less than a year.  Initially an increased dose was missed by my specialist, however now I am taking 20mg/week in a single dose.  I am also on prednisone (reducing this due to osteoporosis development - currently on 9.5/day.  Was started at 40mg/day), and on folic acid once/week.  I did not notice many of the side effects (eg no headaches, nausea etc) and still am a (somewhat less active) energiser bunny in terms of get up and go... I do have some recurring ouchies - the methotrexate is not totally supressing the RA, however I am getting the hair loss .. (ARGHH).  I am active - doing tai chi, gardening, weight/fitness exercises, and playing with my horses (two young arabs who I am training).  I doubt I could function without medical intervention - the RA is nasty.  The meds actually help me keep going.    As for depression and other side effects - I am not the best at tolerating stress at the moment - perhaps related however I have also had a TBI which lurks in the background.    I do know that different people react differently to medications (I'm one of them) - the real thing is to give your doctor a chance at finding out what works.  On rare occasions I will take a painkiller when things get a bit tough.  I did have some severe cramping in my legs at one point - basically I went into spasms.  Still haven't identified the cause, however it coincided with a small stroke I had and the specialists put me onto a chlorestrol reducing drug Lipitor - which can cause similar problems .. it has now resolved and I still take both meds.

Major concern - I keep developing urinary tract infections. Finish treatment & have another info toon 4 days later.

"A year ago, after recovering from carpal tunnel surgery on both of my hands ,I found out that the severe pain in my hands was  being caused from RA. My rheumatologist placed me on a low dose of metho. and 1 mg of folic acid. I did not have much relief in the pain but I stuck with the meds he put me on because he warned me that I would have to wait about 3 mos. before I gained relief. He was right. In 3 mos. the pain  started to decrease and to make a long story short in one year I see a great change. I now take 10 mg. weekly. Most of my hand and foot pain is gone. I had to have my wedding rings sized from a 9 to a 7 1/2. The most bothersome side effects for me are headaches, nausea, some hair loss, occ. blurring of vision and a noticeable decrease of stamina. I also am not as strong as I used to be and I know that I will not be able to pursue nursing again. When I try to paint or do heavy cleaning I have bursitis type pain in both of my upper arms.These symptoms of course may be related more to RA than metho.

He decreased my dosage but I still had side effects.  Since he felt my RA was under control, he eventually took me off of it. I hated that stuff!

I ended up trying to kill myself and landed in the mental hospital.  My doctors kept insisting that the medication was NOT causing it, but all of my friends and family said that they all realized as soon as I started taking it I was acting very weird.

Unfortunately, my sed rate is still in the 40s+, so having to switch to remicade. Blue Cross won't pay but $500 out of $1,600 for Humera shots and as I work and have insurence I don't qualify for the $5.00/mo. break for unemployed/no insurence folks. So, get to go to the hassle of IV infusion thanks to insurance. But, liked methotrexate as it cleared my psorisis and did help some with joint pain and loss of ROM. I'm a therapist so am lucky that mine is all soft tissue and I can with work get my range back when a joint freezes up. Best of luck to everyone.",3
I was on methotrexate for 6 months when i was 17 years old. I quit the medication due to side effects of nausea and emotional problems. Now I am 21 and my rheumatologist put me back on methotrexate in august. i started at 6 - 2.5 mg pills weekly and it took me two months to get over the nausea. i am very tired and once again i am experiencing emotional problems. My doctor doubled my dose of folic acid to help the fatigue problem and decreased the dosage of methotrexate. Methotrexate affects everybody differently. I have a love hate relationship with the drug. I have one family member that loved the drug and another family member that despises it.,4
"when taken as prescribed,with a balanced diet,rest,exercise,a will to well yourself, and a good dr. to monitor your health, there is nothing better.granted, there are a couple of things you have to pay particular attention to,but the positive results of taking this drug is far beyond compare to the negative.    ",4
"Has anyone taken this medicine for the treatment of psoriasis? If so, how did it work. I have not started taking it yet. The dr. is waiting to see the results from my blood work.",1
"I have only been on this medication for two weeks; I have not been able to determine anything good or bad about the drug thus far.  I have sarcoidosis, brain tumor, high blood pressure (uncontroled), lung problems, seizures, pain in my whole body, knots in my hand and feet, left eye pain, severe weakness on my left side and the left side of my head and face draw all the time.  I also have tremors (maily left side) plus musle ticks.  However -- none of the above was caused from the medication.  The reason I am satisfied with the medication is that it has not made me sick at my stomach.  At the same time it has not helped the overall body pain either. ",1
"I do injections. Tired, very mild stomache the 2nd day. I am starting to have some vision issues.",3
"The doctor put me on this medication about a year ago. I started getting lumps on wrists and elbows and he just blew me off when I told him, after what I read on WEBMD I am quitting this drug and getting a new doctor. These lumps are very tender, if I just brush against something I want to go through the roof. ",1
on med 1x wk for 3wks now. so far no help w/pain or inflamation. nausea vomiting pale exhausted and black eyes for first 5 days after taking. feel slightly better day 6 and take again day7. the headaches are impossible to get rid and expect severe noticable hair loss and diarrhea if using this med.  it's as bad as the reviews say. if you can use alternative treatment i recomend it.,1
"I have severe plaque psoriasis of foot soles and palms of hands and began this med on low dose 3 2.5 increasing monthly to 10 2.5. I also take humira every other week. I've seen great improvement from 85% down to about 30% or less but it took a couple months to see this improvement. I feel achy, tired and nauseous for 24 to 48 hrs after the methotrexate, but no side effects from the Humira. Also dr told me methotrexate may require liver biopsies rather than simple blood work to check liver function after the 3 yr mark. I am overall very happy with the results and will continue this combination for as long as it takes. With prayer and these meds I am hoping for a complete reversal of this condition.",4
"i have been taking mth for several weeks now. first at 4/2.5 mg, once a day then just increased to 6/2.5 mg. my painful areas feel much better but i keep having itchy spells.it feels like something is inside my skin and it won't stop. also am taking plaquinel, prednisone, and folic acid.if the itching would stop, i would be very happy.",5
I have just taken my 3rd dose of 7 2.5mg once per week. For the past two days I have suffered severe muscle and bone/joint pain. My fatigue has gotten worse. I am calling my doc in the morning! I also have Raynaud's phenom. & beginning stages of Lupus. Hoping to find a different med that will work!,1
I have been on this for about 2.5 yrs and overall it has helped.I do have side effects which include:weigh gain some lost of hair and nausea.,5
Been taking this in place of predisone. Predisone (steriod) helped me but can't stay on it forever. Too many side effects. I am taking this for inflammation in my feet caused by severe arthiritis. I've taken it for 4-6 months starting out on a low dosage and now up to 8 pills a day once weekly. I cannot tell any change in my condition but will continue on with these untill my next appt. with the Dr. in September.,1
i took methorexate i got severely decreased blood platelets which went back to normal when igot off the drug but i also got cirrhosis of the liver which will never get better it is stage 4 the drug should be took off the market.losing a life is not worth it .,5
"It seems to be working for me in the way of pain, but for some reason I seem to be gaining weight like crazy.  I have only been on the methotrexate, and folic acid,  for 2 months but have put on 9 lbs, I think something is wrong here, any suggestions?",5
"I took 3 2.5mg pills a week for a year then dr upped dosage to 4 2.5 a week...terrible side effects..headache,nausea,blurred vision,dry cough,fatigue, muscle ache in arms and legs. I just laid on the sofa all day too sick and fatigued to do any thing. I went off it and seem to be doing ok...will never take it again...will try some other med.",4
"Methotrexate is a nightmare medicine from hell.  It caused bumps and lumps on my arms and fingers and severe hair loss. It ruined my quality of life in just 9 months of taking it..  Over a year after stopping this medication the lumps still remain and my hair has NOT grown back at all. I am devastated.  I was doing well until I started taking Methotrexate.  I am outraged and furious that I was ever put on this horrible, destructive, life-ruining medication.  Having rhumatoid arthritis was bad enough but to be further destroyed and damaged by this crippling medication is absolutely unforgivable.  I HATE METHOTREXATE, the companies who make it and the doctors who prescribe it.  I can never forgive the damage that this horrible medication has done to me.",1
I was diagnosed with Uveitis 12/2000. Dr told me it was worse case he had ever seen. Was given high doses of prednisone but just would not clear up. Started Methotrexate w/prednisone in 3/01. Was able to come off prednisone but still on Methotrexate 7-2.5 pills once a week. Everytime we try to lower dose have flare up.,4
"I have been on Metho for 2 weeks now. I was not excited about starting this treatment but I have had psoriasis since I was 9 and I have used so many different medications that were not working...I had to give metho a chance. Surprising...no side effects, yet. I am staying positive and hoping I dont have any severe side effects. So far my psoriasis is clearing up. YEAHHHHH!!!!!! ",4
Diagnosed 2 yrs ago.  Been on Metho 1-1/2 yrs. I did experience hair loss for the 1st year.  Very fatigued the day I take meds 7- 2.5 once a week with daily dose of folic acid but good to go the remainder of the week. Almost anything is better than the daily struggle and pain of RA. I feel almost back to normal. I also feel much better when I can exercise.,5
I have taken Methotrexate for over 14 years and was very pleased with the results (very little joint pain and basically went into remission) until recently when I hit my 50's. ,4
"I just took my first dose yesterday - (6)2.5 mg tabs one time per week.  Had no nausea but very dizzy for 2 hours. I am a little tired today, but was able to work all day.  I am hoping that this will relieve the bilateral hip/SI pain that I have had for 2 years now.  Sometimes so bad I can't stand to lay still and I can't stand to move around. Was just dx with RA and have rheum factor of 23. MD said this is pretty high?",2
"I hate the side effects, it takes all of my energy.  It just leaves me feeling fatigued.  I wish there was something else that can be taken.",4
I started on Methotrexate about 6 months ago and immediately saw my hair falling out.  I am taking folic acid but it's not working.  I was encouraged to take prednisone but my fear of weight gain has stopped me from taking it.  I am on Orencia and now Plaquenil and feel worse than before.  I am struggling to try to maintain a normal life and keep working but it's hard.  The pain is all over and I suffer from severe fatigue.  I want to exercise but don't have any strength to do anything. Is there something out there that can be taken that does not require so many medications.  I'm afraid of what kind of damage I am doing to my internal organs with all these meds.,2
"I started this medication seven months ago 11/2009 for a condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis. I had nausea, vomiting, fatigue and rash in the beginning. The nausea and vomiting is gone but I'm still fatigue and have a rash on my face that is terrible. I'm taking four 2.5mg tabs weekly and my doctor wants to increase it. I don't want to increase the dose due to the side effects of this drug. I was on Prednisone, Indomethacine, Celebrex, Mobic and so many other drugs to no avail. I'm seriously thinking of alternative medicine. I hate this drug. Now I feel like I have a liver problem. there has to be a cure for this condition. Everyone else on the blog has RA I'm the only one so far with Ankylosing Spondylitis. ",3
This Med has really helped with the pain.,5
"I am on methotrexate and at first I was losing my hair,but now it is so small until it is not noticeable. I take Folic Acid along with it as well as Simponi and now I feel good. I don't hurt as much.",4
"I started out taking 8 pills a week of and have got down to 4 a week,it seams to be working for me. Diagnosed 1 1/2 years ago.The only thing I do not like is no alcohol within a 72 hour period when using this drug.",5
Only partially effective. Been on methotrexate for 1 year now and dose is still been increased. Now on 10 tablets weekly. Still experiencing joint pain and inflammation.,3
"I started with two tabs last Monday and the next six days were absolutely horrible.  Finally started to feel better on the sixth day.  Was unable to do anything, and even missed our Niece's wedding.  Ended up in hospital overnight side effects were so bad.  Very frustrated at this point.  Please, think twice when taking this and start on a week when you have absolutely nothing to do.  If possible, be prepared to take a week off from work.",1
This medication caused the lining of my stomach to deteroate. I have been in severe pain and was told it would take 2-3 months for the lining to heal.,1
"I don't like taking it because of the side affects, I still experience joint pain.  This is my second time using mexotrexate within the last 10 years, and because of the side affects I didn't take it.",3
I am able to use my hands with no pain..Amazing,4
"Diagnosed with SLE three years ago. Just had a baby and Lupus flared out of control after delivery. This drug has been a life send, side affects are fatigue and nausea but doable and subsided dramatically after a few months...now almost no side effects. No flares since I've been on it. Must get plenty of rest but it's worth it.",5
Been taking 8/2.5 mg MTX for 5 months. Was working well until my rummie cut my prednisone down to 5 mg daily. Some days are really bad. I need somethimg else cause this ain't doibg the trick anymore.,3
"I currently take 4 tablets of 2.5 mg once a week. For the first three weeks I felt no change in my condition, but just this past week I've noticed that I don't wake up feeling as stiff in my joints as I used to.  I also take 1 mg of Folic Acid every day. I had no side effects, and so far I'm doing good.     ",3
"I have been taking MTX for almost 3 months.  The first 4 weeks, I took 6-2.5 mg per week, the pain went down significantly. Unfortunately, due to liver abnormal results, the dose was reduced to 4-2.5 per week; some of the pain came back, but not that severe.  I am also taking Arthrotec and folic acid 1mg daily and have not experience loss of hair or rash. Physical therapy is a must - whenever I am in pain I stop everything and exercise for 20 min and pain is almost gone.  ",4
has worked fine and so far no side effects.,5
i feel good since taking this med,5
"Today I will be taking my fourth dose of 4x2.5mg tablets.  On the first weeks dose I experienced nausea for 2 days, the second week I felt nausea and light headed for two days and last week I felt a bit light headed and spaced out.  I have a review with my consultant next week. The stiffness in my hands and feet is not so apparent but I have had two major flare ups on my wrist and knee where there was no previous inflammation.",2
I started taking 2 2.5 tabs a little over a week ago just took my second dose so I don't really know yet if this is going to work. Both times I have taken the meds I end up throwing up the next 2 days and I am exhausted can anyone tell me if this is normal?  ,2
Ihave been on this drug for 5 months and have not had relief. I want to try something else but Dr. says no.,1
it has done nothing,1
not sure if this work with my RA,2
i worked in the yard all day without pain,4
"The psorisis associated with my Arthritis has completely gone, however I have experienced a swelling which has been diagnosed as soft tissue.",5
severe sie effect such as rash,1
"I am quite happy with the results and relief I have found with metho I have been on it for three months.  up to 6-2.5 once a week.  The pain and stiffness went away about the third day, and I have felt ""normal"" since then.  I am going to the Amazon Jungle to work with a Shamon next month.  I hope the plants will do some good.",5
"I was diagnosed with RA 17 years ago and have taken every medication for this disease. My pain levels were above 10. I began MTX injections 7 years ago with my doctor in Mexico when the local RA doctor told me to come back when the disease had progressed further and was bed ridden. His pseudo name was Dr. How Much Money can I make! The first year and a half of treatment I was taking it with Humira with no positive results. Now I am treated with Rituxin infusion twice a year,10-2.5mg MTX and 5-10mg of Folic Acid. My pain levels range between 5-8 depending on the weather and decreased Rituxin levels before my next infusion. I find Rituxin has been a good benefit to my system, along with MTX and the Folic Acid. The Folic Acid stopped all of my hair loss and the only major side affects I have developed was contributed to the steroid shots I was taking prior to my current treatments. Also, I have an excellent doctor locally and I had to wait 7 months to get an appointment after she reviewed my medical file from my doctor in Mexico. When the pain and inflammation becomes severe I take a medication called Diclofenaco and it is one of the top medications listed in Arthritis Today magazine. I hope my comments have been of some assistance. RA should be given more attention and research by governmental agencies, the reasons it is not is primarily due to the low numbers of patients afflicted with RA. It seems we are not as important as other diseases because of the low numbers when assessing the pro-rata share of money for research.",4
"Have been on Mth for almost a year for RA - side effects were sometimes pretty bad - hair loss at first and stomach upset... loss of taste, etc. but stuck with it and doing great compared to the pain and swelling of RA!!!  ",5
"Take 1cc ORALLY in juice 1X per week and 1mg of folic acid daily (for nausea)for 2+ yrs. Feel better than any other treatment over lifetime (Had SLE since early childhood). Also have fibromyalgia, raynaud's, osteopenia, hypertension. Allergic to plaquenil, sulfasalazine, Imuran.",4
"I was diagnosed thirty years ago with R.A. Was on prednisone for almost fifteen years along with Plaquenil.After all that time on Prednisone, I began breaking bones right and left. My life was narrowed down to Dr visits, out-patient surgery followed by ""stay off your feet six weeks---here's some Vicodin"". Ridiculous way to live. Finally found a wonderful rheumatologist who put me on Enbrel about 15 years ago. Saw a difference immed., then it started losing its effectiveness. Just started on Methotrexate (2.5mg 1x wk) about 6 weeks ago. Cannot believe how much better R.A. is. Still have flares---but not like before; do not have to stay on the couch and grip a walker in order to get up, plus put up with the unbearable pain that only people with R.A. understand. It's really too soon to tell about anything permanent about the Mex., but I'm just so happy to be able to get out of bed without the dread of trying to walk, and the horrid depression that goes with it. No side effects, yet, but I have noticed numbness & tingling in my hands and feet---as though they're asleep. This could be a deal breaker, because I'm dropping things and have no grip. It just started yesterday, and also sinus-type headaches. Will check with the doc on these issues if they continue. But so far, my quality of life has gone from a 2 to a seven!!!",4
it is very strong drug. iam taking 15mg weekly.my joints are free and without inflimation.,5
"Has anyone experienced a lack of taste when using this drug?  My mother has been experiencing this for years, first certain foods that are sweet taste salty and then bitter and some foods now she cannot taste at all.  ",3
"I have been on mtx for approx. 2 yrs.  Could barely walk when I first saw my doc.  Now I am going to my dance class weekly.  Up to 8 2.5mg a week.  Side affects are fatique, stomach issues, weak muscles and a little dizziness.  Overall I think it is doing a good job.  My doc is wanting to add Humira.  I keep stalling on this one.",4
Was on it for over a year. After taking the medication I was nauseated for about 3-4 days and then it was almost time to take it again. Doctor finally took me off of it due to poor quality of life.,3
I got toxic hepatitis when taken with Statin drug for cholesterol,3
I started taking Methx 3 yrs ago.  Started with 4 2.5 pills a wk and now taking 10 2.5 a wk.  My hands always go to sleep mostly at night.  Because I am always tired I was told to take 1 mg of Folic Acid daily.  Not really seeing a difference am constantly in pain Dr just says that is because I have RA.  Think it is time for me to find a new DR that can help me be a little more comfortable.,3
"Started on Celebrex, developed rash w/in 1 wk. Next, Ultram, put me to sleep standing up! #3, prednisone 15 mg/day worked better than nothing.  At least I could walk again.  Finally put on metho @ 15 mg/wk w/Daypro 2x daily & folate 1x/day  I'm walking w/out a cane or walker again.  I get lab work monthly.  My inflammatory markers are almost w/in normal range again.",4
I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEM WITH MY BREATING HAVE HAD EVERY TEST CHECKING MY LUNGS.I HAVE NOTICED ONE OF THE SIDE AFFECTS TAKING MEHORREXATE IS MAY CAUSE LUNG PROBLEMS.HAVE BEEN ON THIS DRUG FOR YEARS.I THINK IT IS ABOUT TIME TO COME OFF IT AND SEE IF MY PROBLEM CLEARS UP.,3
"Stiffness has improved, but I am experiencing tingling in both feet and hands. Dr. just added folic acid. Anybody have similar experiences? ",3
" I've begun using Methx one month ago. 4, 2.5 pills once a week along with folic acid daily, Pauquinel and Relefen and vitimin D3. The major side effect that I experience is tireness and nausea. I tend to be more forgetful. My fingers continue to swell and twist, wrists hurt. I go in for blood work every other week. I have to wonder...what did they use in the days when there were no drugs.",2
I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS TREATMENT HAS BEEN SATISFACORY FOR ME.,5
"I've been on it for a month today. My guttate psoriasis has pretty much cleared up, 98%.  I am on this stuff for another 2 months to go.  I take 5mg 12 hours apart, (3 doses) once a week.  I get lab work done the day before to ensure mu kidneys and liver are not effected in anyway.  This was my last alternative, I tried everything, to avoide taking a percription...but it has changed my life around.  I can take my kids to the pool, go to the gym, and WEAR A T-SHIRT!  I hope this resets my skin growth clock when I get off of it... hope this helps somebody!",5
"At 40 years old, I am now taking 20mg once a week. I have had minor side effects such as some hair loss (but nothing noticeable to anyone but me), fatigue and occasional stomach discomfort. But those aside, my pain and swelling in my ankle, wrists and hands is greatly improved. The good days are far more often now! ",4
"this is the 2nd time I have been perscribed this drug // 1st time it was like a magic it worked great,but I had to get off it was causeing a problem with my liver. this time it's not working as well.",3
"Just started taking the drug (6 pills)...took my second dose this morning.  It has not had any impact yet on my symptoms, but I was told not to expect relief right away.  And no side effects so far.  I also take Naproxen (500mg 2x/day) and folic acid (1x/day).  I have an appointment in about 6 weeks, and I was told that if I am getting no relief, we may increase the dosage.",1
I was on methotrexate for five years and I had to be taken to the hospital couldn't breath and they found a black cloud on my lungs no insurance haven't had lung test yet since 2006 hopefully Iam ok in 2010.,1
Severe rash,1
"The only bad thing about MT is I have noticed a change in my hair...seems to be almost ""dead"" and wondering if anyone else has experienced this.  I'm not losing it, it just isn't the same anymore???",4
"I have been taking Mtx for 4 months now and am up to 8 (2.5 mg) pills once a week.  I have not experienced any really bad side effects: no nausea, no hair loss, no rashes...but I do find myself tired a lot.  I have been weaned off Prednisone and my hands and feet have gotten bad: swelling, pain, stiffness.  However, my Dr. says this may be from Osteoarthritis rather than RA.  I haven't received the results of blood tests on liver yet.  I will see my Dr. in a few days.  Because of all the possible long term damage, I am going to ask about discontinuing the RA.  ",3
"I've been on Methotrexate now for 9 years! LOVE it! Sure keeps my disease in control. Was on Celebrex first, for 1 yr., then became immune to it. I get liver checked with blood test every other month, NO LESS! And I take folic acid, it's a MUST! I'm lucky, hope I can continue to be able to take this drug!",5
"First started on Placquinil with poor resutls.  Went on methotrexate about 7 mnonths ago. Started out on 6 pills a week/once a week and after 4 months didn't feel any better.  Dr increased dosage to 8 pills a week/once a week and within 6 weeks I was feeling much better!  Most of the joint pain is completely gone, I'm not near as tired.  I'm close to having my life back!  Did experience some mouth sores at first but not now.  Haven't noticed an increase in colds or anything, but then I don't have kids and work in a private office.  This has really helped me!  I do take Tramadol w/a couple of acetaminophen 3-4 times a day for back/hip pain (car accident).  The Tramadol was not helping my hand/finger pain much at all.  The Methotrexate has done the trick for me.  Hope it keeps on working!  ",4
"I've been taking metho for 8 mos. and have seen vast improvment in my condition. However, I am not completely cleared up. On the down side, I was told by my dr not to drink alcohol while taking this medicine so the biggest bummer,  I miss having a cocktail once in a while. ",4
"I was diagnosed with RA in March 09 I started out with the injections but I'm now on 10 2.5mg pills a week also on hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and folic acid. Other than having more colds due to lowered immune system(and living with three children under the age of ten)I haven't had any problems. With the other medications it definately helped bring me back to where I felt human again. Glad to be on oral meds now, if there are any new developments will let you know. Best Wishes",4
"I am 23 yrs old and was crippled for a while with polymyositis. i was put on this as well as prednisone,  i still take that and imuran and a ton of other things. i am CONSTANTLY in pain but no longer crippled... i am thankful for being able to walk but i just wish it wasn't so darn painful... methotrexate at first caused extreme stomach pain and diarrhea which i still have diarrhea all the time as well as hair loss, i just recently chopped my hair off because i was tired of chunks falling out. i feel like i'm doing chemo. but now they're about to start me on some sort of iv treatment. so hopefully that works",4
"It has worked along with prednisone and plaquninal however, and now having terrible headaches and constand buzzing in one ear also annoying cough - having blood work, chest xray and Dr visit tomorrow - keep ya posted!",4
"I have been on this since Mar. 2008 at 20mg a week.I have thinner hair,i got mouth sores,other then that no other side effects,but when taking this with Enbrel,or Humria,Melozicam,I had bad side effects, and still was getting flare up,stuffness,swelling,fingers bented some,and more bone growths,so I was taken off it Oct.2009. Trying different medicene without injections too. ",2
"2004 Bad psoriasis and Severe Joint pains started. 2008 put on 12.5 and worked down to 5 mg MTX. Skin is clear with lil scarring. Joints all over getting much worse at this time. Still not sure what type arthritis at this point. (RA, OA, Psoriatic, :(  ) Am patiently waiting while I am at the point of now seeking disability retirement from USPS-HELP LOL",3
"Helping with swollen joints, but causing muscle pain all over my body. Also lymphadema in right arm less troublesome after taking this medication.",3
it was tricky getting the dosage right due to constant nausea but fine now.,4
Worked great for the first year with progressivly increasing the dose from 12.mg po once a week to 20mg po once a week. It's not working as well as it first did. Now I am adding stronger meds.,5
"I have been on Methotrexate 6 2.5mg plus folic acid and Humira for about 3 years.  About a month ago I tried to come off the methotrexate because I couldn't tell it was working.  I almost became crippled with pain without the medicine.  Realized just how important it was in my treatment.  Prior treatment was 8 2.5 pills weekly but I had a huge amount of hair loss so my Dr. decreased it to 6 pills weekly, this stopped the hair loss.  I do find that if I take the pills in the evening about 6 or 7 pm then it decreases my chances of stomach upset which I have if taken in the mornings.  I too am only 42 and I am seeing a huge amount of crippling of my hands and feet but most of my pain is in my upper thighs.  Legatrin is a great medicine for that.",5
"I took the 1st dose ( 2-2.5MG) a week ago today and experienced no side effects at all.  I haven't seen any change; however, remain hopeful. ",1
I've been taking MTX for 6 years now for JRA and it's done wonders with my inflammation. It pretty much non-existent now. I feel great.,5
"In my eighth week of treatment.  Some relief at first, thought itn was going to be great.  I feel the RA is overpowering it now.  Bad week this week.  Going to stick with it because I don't like the other options.",4
I have been on this medication since 9/03/09 and have had no results.,1
"I have systemic lupus with rhematoid.I stopped taking it for two months, oh my God I developed edema in my bone marrow and couldnt walk. I never felt so much pain. I had to get my knees drained and was hospitalized.My rheumatologist put me back on it. I take 8 2.5 Tabs once a week.     ",5
"I have only been taking Methotrexate for one month now. Mr Dr. put me on this b/c my RA is progresssing faster than was predicted (I got diagnosed at 28 and I'm 36). I haven't noticed any difference. I'm still in constant pain throughout by whole body. My knees and hands are constantly swollen and cracked. I'm still taking it, waiting on it to start working. I have had some stomache problems since taking this med, but I haven't experienced the hairloss. I'm also waiting on something to work for my RA. The pain this causes is dibilitating.",1
"I have been taking 6 pills of MTX a week for about 2yrs now and it really hasn't done much. It helps only enough for me to tolerate the pain but I am no where near 100%.I still have pain in my shoulders, fingers, hips,and knees. I take 6 Naproxen (500mg) a day and that still doesn't help! My middle finger is crooked now so I know its not stopping the joint damage. Now my Dr is talking about putting me on Humira. Hopefully that works!",1
"I have been taking Metho for almost 1 year, 8x2.5mg weekly. Previously I was taking Imuran which became ineffective. This med does help me, however, it does mean that I catch things like colds/flu a lot easier and they last longer, and go straight to my Respiratory system. It's a trade-off though, and it has decreased the pain and swelling all over my body. This med did not restrain the SLE as long as I had hoped, as I am now taking Prednisone for the last 3 months, low dose 10mg/daily. I can definitely tell when it is wearing off, as my joint pains return almost with a vengance. ",4
"THE SIDE EFFECTS OF METHATREXATE WAS , acne,dizziness,headache,tiredness all the time,leg pain,diarrhea,back pain,blured vision.I didn't anticipated the side effects of this medication.",1
The only problem I have is headachs. I use to take this 2years ago and never had this problem I think its because im takeing other meds with it and just started  mtx about 3weeks ago my body must be adjusting still but I have noticed a little  change in how I feel ,5
"Since being on Methotrexate (3+ years) my RA and Lupus have been under control.  I haven't felt this good in years and work 40 hours per week!  Before the Methotrexate It hurt so much to move and my lupus flared frequently!  After trying Effexor XR, Hydrocodone, lyrica,Naproxen,Prednisone,and Zoloft, Methotrexin has been my best medicine for my condition.  It has made moving around and walking, gardening more available to me! Methotrexate Rules!",4
just took the first dose yesterday and today I have I think a urinary tract infection with bleeding and temp. What can I take? If not Ibuprohren how about Tylenol or what pain pill I only have Hydorcodone,2
"Having many sytoms such as bone pain, savier skin rash, fatique",1
I took the oral methotrexate with very little relief. I am now on the methotrexate injection and it is much better. I guess my ulcerative colitis caused issues with the absorbtion of the oral dose.  I take this along with Plaquenil and Humira and am virtually pain free. ,2
After 4 months joints are pain free and move easily but I tire easily and the supressed immune system means more illness since I travel frequently.  No illness is serious but it impairs my life choices. Still balancing how long to take it and building the immune system.,5
HAVE ANYONE EXPERIENCE HEADACHES WHILE USING THIS MEDICINE,3
"In 3 months 2 bad infections requiring each requiring 7 days Hospitalization. 3 days of no energy after taking, very bad mouth ulcers, badley swolen feet. This drug nto for me. Previous drug cytoxan which worked well.",2
It is 6 weeks only since I havebeen started on this drug. I have been advised 5mg of Methotrexate every SUNDAY morning & at bed time. I do not have much of an experience to share now.,1
"All of the RA med seem to carry ""damned if you do and damned if you don't.  I've been on MTX for about a year, but taken off twice due to elevated liver enzymes.  each time i was off, the flares became much worse with dibilitaing pain.  I also take Arava which i am still on.  on MTX, i was pain free.  now i'm on Tramadol w/Tylenol but it only covers the pain; does not treat it. I haven't seen much about elevated liver enzymes on here; wondering if it's a rare thing.  Hoping that my doc will find something new to help me.  i do not know how all of you have managed to live with this extremely painful disease for so many years.  ",4
SINCE TAKING THIS MEDICATION FOR RA I HAVE NOT HAD A FLARE UP. I LIKE THE IDEA OF TAKING THIS MEDICATION ONCE A WEEK.,5
"I have been taking metho for about 8 years due to having been treated for cancer prior to my ra diagnosis.  ALthough it helps with the inflamation,it does not stop the progression of the disease.  I did find that the oral is just as effective as injections, so I opt for taking it orally.",3
I had JRA at the age of 13 was put on metho along with a host of other drugs then at the age of 18 it went from JRA to RA.  Yesterday just found out it's now in the serve mode I have bone missing in both knees and right elbow. I have been on and off this med for 18 years as the doctors have advised me to.  I am on 9x2.5 mgs of metho along with alot of other pills.  This med does work a lot however it makes me tired and I have stomach problems with it.  I still have pain associated along but it's not as bad.,5
"I am 10wks pregnant, before I got pregnant my partner was on Methotrexate. He has stopped the treatment 3 wks before I became pregnant, I am nervous that my baby will have birth defects? A genetic Dr had told me not to worry but I cannot help it. ",1
just started taking this drug for rheumatoid arthritis,3
"Im satisfied with the way the treatment is going, I've only been on it a week and already can tell a big difference",2
I am reading on this med. b/c I am only 26 years old and I am supposed to start it on Monday. I have a 7 year old child and honestly I am scared to start a med with such high/crazy side effects. I have psoriasis with arthritis and RA. But I manage very well with the pain for the most part. I do have sores all over my body from it though. I guess my question is- is it really worth it at my age? If you could please email with your storys and opinions. good and bad. [email protected]  please and thank you very much!!! god bless,1
I have had frontal hair loss that is very visible and quite noticeable.  Other than the hair loss I have no problems with this medication.,2
"I have been on this now for 4 months with planquniel, dr just increased to 6-2.5mg take folic acid now 2x a day, I also use men's rogaine 1x a day for hair loss and it works, it has been 5 weeks now that I feel like I am part of the human race again! I can do so many things now with my children!",5
"Just wanted to provide another less scary review for those people whom are looking to our reviews to help them decide if this might help them. This is my fourth week, I take 4-2.5mg tabs 1xwkly w/folic acid and prednisone. It has really improved my quality of life and I haven't experienced hair loss or any of the other scary side effects. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will give an update when I have been on it longer. Good Luck and Don't Give Up! ",4
"I got better results with the drug when combined with enbrel. however, Im experiencing a lot of hair loss. I assumed at some point when my body got use to it, the hair loss would stop, but it hasnt. I started taking 8 pills per week, for the first 6 weeks, but still experienced a lot of pain. The enbrel was added and about 7 weeks later I almost felt normal most of the time.  For the past 3 weeks my doctor decreased the methotrexate to four to see if I would maintain my improvement and to see if the hair loss would subside. I have been experiencing discomfort in my rists and fingers for the past week, but not sure if its due to the decrease in medication dosage. ",4
"I have been taking metro for about six weeks,and Have lost eyelashes and my hands first flaked like a snake and now my feet are doing it. I also take 1 folic acid a day.Is this normal. I seem to think I have bugs crawing on me and I don't. Very itichie.",3
"I have been taking 3 Methotrexate once a week for about 8 months with 1 Folic Acid a day. I have in the past 3 to 4 months developed severe back pain with constapation. I had been 5'4"" tall most of my life but have schrunk to 4'7"" over the past 5 to 6 years. I have had regular blood test done which shows no problems but have been in the hospital twice over the past 2 years with blockage in my bowls and severe back pain to the point of tears. My feet do swell slightly. My gastrointestinal doctor has said since I have schrunk so much my intestines and bowls are having problems digesting the food I eat so has put me on a High Fiber diet and I take 2 perdiums every morning with Metamusil once a day. This does not always work so if I do not have a bowl movement after 2 days I take 2 Colace at night. My back is still in constant pain and extremely tight across my lower back that rus up my intestinal area. Does anyone have any suggestions that might help mewith this. I do not know how much longer I can handle it. ",3

I was on Plaquanil for over 10 years and it just stopped working. My hands and wrists swelled to almost twice their size. Dr prescribed 10 mgs prednisone and 6 Methotrexate.Now down to no prednisone and only on Methotrexate. Very little side effects and weather change I do have a litte problem but can deal with it. I was told yesterday by my MD I am a very lucky woman according to my blood test results. I also do take 1 folic acid a day.,4
It has helped to check psoriasis of my foot temporarily.,4

"I am a single mother and have had RA for about 8 years. I have been taking Methotrexate for 3 months now along with Folic acid daily. First my Dr started me with 4 pills per week then bumped it up to what she said was the max, 8 pills.  My joint pain has gone away; have soreness in hands and shoulder periodically. I do get fatigued and I had muscle pains that brings tears to my eyes that I can't hide from my 13yr old daughter.  I have no soars in mouth, and not thinning or loss of hair so far.  The Rx info received with my prescription mentioned a side effect of irregular menstrual cycles for women and my cycle has come a week earlier for the past two months. I have tried sulfazine, plaquanile, arava and previously methotrexate. I've had allergic reactions or acquired a cold that results in moving to the next drug.

"I have been on this Methotrexate for a little over 3 months.  My skin started clearing the first week.  My skin is no longer inflamed, painful, or itching (in other words, it no longer hurts to wear clothing).  When I first started the medication, I felt nausea, and muscle weakness.  Now I'm just tired most of the time.  I think the trade off was worth the effort.",5
"I have had to stop eating almost all vegetables because of the folic acid prescribed to accompany the med.  Now, what do I eat for my low-fat, high-fiber diet needed for other health issues?",2
"I have only been on Methotrexate for about 2 & a half months. The first 2 months I was so discouraged. I took the pills & simply couldn't see one bit of improvement. Darn I didn't even expierence a side affect lol. My Immunologist asked me to give it a little more time. He said for some reason the 2 month mark was like the magic number. I kid you not it was almost 2 mths to the day, I found myself almost pain free.I still get little flare-ups & a week or so of Prednisone W/Methotrexate and Im usually back to normal. The hardest part of this condition for me was actually getting diagnosed and getting somone to believe the amount of pain I was in.. It took 6mths or more to get the nerve to find a specialist myself.. Had I waited on my family Dr. Id still be poping Vicodans and typing jibberish to you right now lol.  I was & still am unemployed so obviously, I did not even know how to get a Dr. to even see me. One Sunday afternoon I was in so much pain in my hands joints along with  pressure from the swelling on the Carpal Tunnel nerves, I was literally in the floor crying. I had this fleeting thought, that somewhere sitting in a Drs. Office was a Dr. that cared more about my pain than my Ins. or ability to pay. See how pain can cause you to have bizzare fleeting thoughts lol. But it wasn't it must have been Divine intervention. I got out the phone book and called the best hospital in my area, which was WAKE FOREST University BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER in Winston Salem N.C. Finally a Dr. answered her phone. Her specialty was not even in the field I needed. But she listened to every word.But she did say WFUBMC was funded with grants to do charity care or 1/2 price rates for those without ins. She said I had to first get into thier system &to go to thier ER. I did, I got my Dr.& the hospital donates my RX's If you are hurting & w/o medical help, please try your local University Hospital. This condition is too painful & distructive for you to handle on your own. Good Luck",5
"I was prescribed this as treatment for Myasthenia Gravis in Oct. 2007 along with frequent plasma pheresis. Full effect was not achieved until this year, as I was slowly stepped up in dosage. I now take 10 mg twice per day, one day per week. Since starting MTX I have been able to lower my steriod usage to 10mg/day from 60mg/day. Its use has at least stabilized my MG. I have only been hospitalized for MG crisis twice since Jan 2008, vs. 13 times 2007.",4
"I have taken for over 15 years.  It was a mircle drup for me. I thought I was going to be wheel chair bound but not any more.  It has helped be lead a almost normal life.  I was unable to climb stairs, raise hands over head, hurt all over and had nodules on elbows (that have gone away).  I had tried all the NSAIDS, also on plaquinal & predisone.   Eventually was able to dropped the plaqunil, and predisone.  I am on 5 2.5 mg tablets weekly and 1 MG Folic Acid each day. I think the folic acid reduced the side effects because I have taken it faithfully and never experienced the side effect of hair loss, nausea etc.   Have had my blood checked each month as scheduled to monitor blood counts and liver functions.  Had to go in for recheck once after I had taken tylenol durint the month for headaches.  OK after I stopped the tylenol.   Last year I had some issues come up,  hair loss, loss of appetite, fever, night sweats, shortness of breath, and then pain on left side ao bad it hurt to move.  Was diagnosed with a plerual effusion and had to be hospitalized for fluid to be removed.  Not sure what caused all this.  Rheumatologist didn't think it was Methotrexate.  ",5
went from oral to injection during the last 3 years.  Both leave me nauseous and very tired.  Also take steroids.,3

"I was just diagnosed with RA last month.  The pain was unbearable.  I was put on 6 2.5 mg. of methatrexate a week along with medrol 4 mg.daily.  I haven't had any pain or swelling since I started taking.  They are now starting to lower the doseage of medrol to 2 mg. for 2 weeks and then off of it completely, which is a little scary.  It's been great to be pain free for the first time in a long time.  I have had no side effects at all.  I will just keep my fingers crossed.",5
"My diagnosed issue is called Psoriatic Ankylosing Spondylitis with a side order of RA & Crohns. Current dosage: 8 x 2.5mg per wk. I'm also down to 3mg of prednisone a day. About every other day I need to take 1 50mg Indocin. I truely believe my stomach problems are related to Indocine and not crohn's. I don't have typical crohn's symptoms just the bleeding part.  I find my body adjusts to the MTX dosage. Right now I'm struggling to stay at 8 x 2.5mg dosages. It does effect my psoriasis fairly quick, about 10 days. But it doesn't clear me up completely. Just allows me to be comfortable but I still have red skin patches that do not shrink or go away. Years ago when I was first on mtx it used to clear me up completely. Now that I'm older it seems the drug isn't as effective against my skin issue. This like all drugs can NOT be used indefinitely. Your system will adjust and you'll have to move onto something else. That's why this is my second go w/MTX. I've read where humira is supposed to be better but if you don't have good insurance be prepaired to pay $1500 per one two week injection. I'm not kidding. New drugs are nice only if you can afford them. My insurance rejected my doctor's request to put me on humira.  That's why I'm back to MTX. Over all I function in a full time job. I've had this problem since I was 20. Now at 56 I've learned it doesn't get any better with age. Keep a positive attitude and don't give up. Also, as much as it may hurt you HAVE TO exercise. I found my drug dosage seems to be more effective when I exercise. When I stop exercising all of my problems exacerbate regardless of the dosage.     ",3

"Been taking MTX for 6 wks - 4/2.5mg tabs. No problems w/fatigue (actually, it kinda winds me up, which contradicts what many other people experience). My stomach has been a little queezy, coupled w/a lack of appetite, but that seems to be getting better. I do, however, have horrible oral ulcers/mouth sores that are rather unberable. I've been taking 1 mg of Folic Acid daily. My Doc just put me on Leucovor which is Folinic Acid which he said helps w/hair loss & mouth sores. Havne't had any hair thinning, but some say it takes about 2 months of being on the MTX for that to start happening. My doc wanted to bump me up to 5 MTX tabs, but is holding off for 8 wks, so that I can get the mouth sores under control.",3

"Diag with Lupus SLE 2005 did prednizone for 7mths to get swelling down in joints and 2mths into that methotrexate was added along with folic acid.  I take 7 x2.5mg tablets every Sunday. First 4mths was horrible, throwing up, diareaha generally feeling really bad. Not so bad now, I can feel it wearing off by Fridays. Still have bowel problems and the fatigue is bad. Have to take a nap everyday by 2pm or I am asleep by 7pm.  Have not had a ""flair"" since I started this drug.  I miss not being able to have a drink of alcohol at social events, but I have ""non alcoholic"" versions.  I have to have blood work twice a month to check liver etc.  Overall I think this drug works well for Lupus and keeping joint pain to something that is manageable since pain meds are not encouraged while taking metho because of the negitive effects on the liver.  If you have Lupus I would recommend methotrexate.",4

My side effects include headaches, occasional nausea, extreme fatigue.

If your doctor refuses, find another doctor that wants to work with you.  You have to advocate for yourself.  My heart and prayers go out to all of you battling for better health.  Good luck.",2

I don't like the side effects but they're necessary for the help it gives me and not as bad as how I would be without it.  I'm tired all the time and have hair loss (and I'm only 21).,3
1st treatment tried from a specist.worked from the 2nd week. tried clexabrex that did o from regular Dr.,5
I really dislike the hair thinning.  It is more thinning than loss. Fatigue is major side effect.  I think the shot of depomedrol that I get 3 times a year helps the best.  Not sure if I want to stay on this long term.  Pain in joints has decreased but not sure if I really need this long term.,3
this medicine worked wonders for me im on my second treatment of 5 times once a week and my knee is back to its normal size wich i have not seen in over 2 months nd no pain i mean there are some bad days but overall i am soo happy to have gotten this drug im only 16 i couldnt imagin goin on with out it ,5
worked well for me. I had to stop taking it because of liver problems.,4
"I am currently taking 8 2.5 mg once a week.  When I first started this medicine, I read the reviews, and they rather frightened me.  After having taken it for 4 months now, I have not had any of the extreme things that frightened me, and I wonder if everyone's doctor gives them the folic acid with it.  I have had no hair loss, tiredness leveled out quickly.  I do get tired some, and initially some brief dizziness, but that really improved very quickly.  It has helped my RA, but I don't think enough.  I see my doctor again in a few days, and I think we will discuss other options. But I did want to write to say ask your doctor about folic acid, and to add a less scary review than the ones I had read.  ",3
"I JUST STARTED TAKING METHOTREXATE, ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO, BUT IM ON THE PREDNISONE WITH IT. AND IT HAS REDUCED MY PAIN ALOT BUT NOT TOTALLY. I STILL HAVE SERVRE DAYS. ",3
8 x 2.5mg/week. I worked up to this dose over several months. Taking folic acid is essential to combat fatigue. I still get mouth sores the day I take the mtx but that is the only side effect now. It took 3-4 months to be effective. It's better for the joint pain than the skin for me.,4
so far ok. but hair loss and tired.,4
Very effective for psoraises,5
my aching and throbing has almost stop but i still have alot swelling. i take 5 pills once a week at 2.5mg,3
Psoriasis cleared 90-95 percent within a short amount of time. No side effects after being on methotrexate  (six 2.5 mg once per week) for over a year.,4
"after  starting methotrexate within weeks most of my systems eased alot, its been a god sent.",4
"I hated this drug. I felt like my limbs were not connected to my body and all I could do was curl up on the couch. I was on Celebrex at the same time. I have a very demanding job with long hours so I just quit taking everything and hope for the best with a healthy diet,and trying to stay positive. There is no rheumatologist where I live or anywhere close by so I just do the best I can on my owm.",1
"I have a type of spondyloarthropathy.I have been taking 7.5mg a week for about 8weeks. Im fine as long as I stay on prednisone with this, but the moment I go off of prednisone I start swelling and then I get stiff and can't straighten out my leg, ankle or elbow. Dr.s going to up my dose to 15mg. so we'll see what happens.Have some diarhea hairloss and dizzyness.",3
"I am not sure about this medication, I have just finished my thrid round.  ( orally - 10 mg. per week )   It seems to help me a few days - but wear off quickly.  This week, I have noticed "" Lumps"" on my back also - they are puffy and sore.  I read that this might be a side effect of the medication - so I am anxious to talk to my Dr. and see if its related.    I hope this is helpful and appreicate all the others who have added entires, as they may help me too! Reb / Abilene",3
"Being treated for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Was taking 15mg of Methotrexate weekly and 40mg of Prednisone daily. Have been weaned off of the Prednisone because of side effect issues after long time use and now only take the Methotrexate. Joint pain is excrutiating, don't see much improvement. Quality of life is in the toilet. I spend my days and nights in my recliner unable to walk or stand for more than 5 minutes at a time, am in constant pain. Some diarrhea and stomach upset as well as hair loss and EXTREME fatigue. Unable to perform the everyday tasks ex. cooking, cleaning, bathing, dressing myself need assistance. Dr. eventually wants to wean me off of the Methotrexate as well. Then what??? Oxycodone helps offset the pain somewhat but do not want to live my life on pain killers. There has to be something better!!!!!!!!",2
side effects include: anger outbursts after being in sun. rash on chest. eyesight problems. ,5
"My life had become so small that our family no longer ate at the dinner table. My family would bring dinner to me in bed, because I could not sit at the table. A life without methotrexate was filled with pain, and fatique and now it's getting bigger in all the right places. Thanks!",5
"I have a severe degree of RA with it active in 90 % of my joints before treatment.  at first the drug make me very dizzy and vomit occassionally, but now that i have been on it for a bit i don't have any major side effects.  i still am sore at times, but through taking Ibprofen, and taking a hot bath, or walking i do very well and you can't tell i have the disease. the monthly blood tests have all been fine.  I have been very satisfied with this medication.",4
I suppose I was hoping for a wonderful relief from the pain I have been experiencing.  WRONG!!  All it has done is wasted 3 1/2 years of my life. I have been in the hospital numerous times and I now have tumors on my adrenal gland and in my liver thanks to the prednisone and methotrexate.  I have had NUMEROUS kidney stones (more painful than child birth) and now I am having even more pain in my joints than before as well as undetermined infections in various places.  STAY AWAY....STAY FAR AWAY!  The side effects of the steroid and methotrexate are far worse than the benefits.  I have yet to find anything that relieves the pain except pain medication which my doctor refuses to give me.  BEFORE you take this medication please please please review and research and get a second opinion before starting.  May your life be blessed with good health. ,1
I used this drug for my first ectopic pregnancy it took care of everything  my life was not in danger anymore. But I would strongly recomend that everyone having an ectopic pregnancy way your options because 6 months later I had my second ectopic pregnancy and had to have emergancy surgery to take my tube out which was the same tube both times. It's hard enough to go though that once but a second time is horrible. Life does go on and remember you don't have to get over it right away all of us have to grive over a loss of a child.,5
Ihave really not had side affects while taking this med.,5
"I have been taking 10 2.5mg once a week since August of 2006. My psoriasis has cleared up for the most part. it is still on my arms and face! I have tried creams with it as well. nothing is working. My lymph nodes are constantly swollen and the day after taking the meds i feel horrible. I am not able to do anything. it interferes with my school work and cannot focus. I have also gained a new condition with my eyes. its some kind of rare disorder, not sure what its called! I have fits of dizziness through out the day and am nauseas with the majority of the things i eat. Has anyone had any problems with coughing up blood? it happens to me every week, without fail. I am concerned about getting another condition, lymph nodes in my arms are swollen also. its a great medication if you are willing to deal with the side effects.",4
"My father is suffering from internal bleeding, liver functions are poor and he has already been given 10 pints of blood due to bleeding in stomach.  He may not pull through if the bleeding does not stop.  This drug has potent side effects especially with the ederly.  ",1
"I have been on methotrexate (6 tabs 1x week) for 4wks now.  I also take prednisone 5mg 1xdaily (was @10mg 1xdaily).  I have always had mouth sores, (part of the disease)  but I recently started getting terrible heachaces and a severe rash on face/nose and alot of mouth sores.  Dr told me that this drug doesnt cause headaches???  But he did prescribe me a new vitimin to start today??  Im hoping for some relief. I lost the ability to bend or straighten my right arm,  hoping for some improvement,  nothing so far!!!",2
Not sure if related yet. I have been very very tired!! Exhausted. I can hardly get up in the mornings I yawn all day long. I have no engery at all. I feel weird and not normal at all.,3
"Saw Rheumotologist for extreme joint pain. I could not raise arms over my head because of the pain.Three days after taking a shot of Methotrexate pain was gone .I am now taking 5 pills all at once,once a week and still have no pain.I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthitisberaz3",5
I have taken this medication for almost three years and I see very little improvement in my arthritis.  Although It is quite possible that if I changed doctors and found an md that actually did something other than have me come in weigh me and feel my joints then hand me pre-printed prescriptions that all he does is sign maybe I might find a little better outcome with this medication. ,2
Has been great. I got where I couldn't walk and my fingers would lock up.  I could lift anything. This has all gone away. I take 6 tab.( 2.5 mg )once a week. This medcine has been great for me. No side affects . I have been taken this for over 5 years. Blood test monthly and have all been good. Stiffness and soreness when wheather changes but I take an Alive and its gone. ,5

It was worked well, I am now not on the steroids. I am on 11, 2.5 pills once a week. I have had minimal hair loss, but have think hair and it would be hard to tell. I have however gotten a rash, on my lower back that itches, twice now. Had creme to heal it, and cleared it right up. Did loose just about all the weight I gained with the steroids.

After a recent foot surgery I got an infection and still 8 weeks later and much antibotics my white blood cell count is too high.  I am feeling it is because of this med,4
"Joint pain is much better, but now have tendon pain and inflammation. Side effects haven't been bad, minimal hair loss, doc prescribed 1mg Folic Acid to protect against mouth sores and haven't had any. Day after fatigue and foggy brain are bothersome but better than constant pain.",4
"I have been taking Methotrexate for over a year now. I was started on 4 tabs 2.5 mg weekly. My doctor just reduced it to 3 tabs weekly, because I am starting to experince increased hair loss. I have read that others are having hair loss. Does this stop, or does it continues while I on the methotrexate? The medication has helped me very much and I'm just hoping that the hair loss will eventually stop. If there is anyone that has experienced a reversal of the hair loss, please email me at: [email protected]",5

I was taking this medicine for erythema nodosum. I took it for 4 months. Since it was during the winter I thought that one of the side effects was just a bad viral cold that left me having a terrible cough. After 5 visits to the doctor they figured out that it was the medicine. It worked great for the erythema nodosum but the chest pain and coughing sucked.,5
No positive improvement has been noted within a period of over six months.,1
"Just picked up my 1st script today, and after reading some of these reviews I'm not sure I want to injest these things. If I lose a handfull of hair before I get a handfull of relief...it's over...I'll go back to massive doses of tylenol. Here goes.....",1

"I have been taking 6 - 2.5 MG Metotrexate for 1 year I have been very happy with the effectiveness, rarely do I have flare ups and my pain and swelling is minimal. The side effects however, are terrible,I have become fearful of the sun, whenever I go out I wear sunblock 70. I immediately look for shade, the second the sun hits my skin I'm on fire and if I don't get out of the sun within a few minutes, the burning will continue for hours after I'm back in the shade. the 2nd side effect is the hair falling out, it falls out by the handfuls, I wash my hair only when neccessary and brush my hair only when leaving the house. The last side effect is the tiredness, I have to take naps everyday, this is not a choice. and I have begun to just feel very ill.

"I have been on this for several months now for severe pustulosis of the palms and soles. I have experienced the majority of the side effects associated with this medicine.  Unfortunately as we increase the dosage we increase my moodiness, etc.  Also the medicine has not relieved the symptoms associated with my skin issue.  It seems to be more of a burden with the side effects considering that it doesn't appear to be helping.  I will stick with it a bit longer to see if I can see results at the higher dosage.",1

"I have been taking 12.5mg/week for 4 months & it has helped me tremendously. Initially,  there was some hair loss(has stopped now) & the fatigue is generally isolated to the day I take the dosage--I have had no other side effects & the pain is very very minimal at most.",5

"If this med was so good, I wouldn't need arava, would I?  I'm terrified of the side effects.  I haven't had any but I think having RA symptoms are better than the side effects of methotrexate.

"For 6 years I was on a number of oral meds and had stopped disease progression entirely.  However, scans finally showed new bone mets, and for first time, mets in liver and lungs. The oncologist offered Navelbine or Abraxane, the advantage to Navelbine being that you do not lose your hair.  After 4 cycles of drugs, scans were repeated and it clearly did not help.  Lots of new bone mets, liver mets almost doubled in size, and 20 new lesions in lungs.  I was so disappointed.  Will begin Abraxane next week.    As far as side effects, I had to take Neulasta shots a number of times because the bone marrow was so suppressed.  Fatigue was a definite problem.  Otherwise, very easy to take.",1

Flu like symptoms started day after injection, uncomfortable, but manageable. injection on Thursday, but by Monday early evening I could barely walk. INTENSE and excruciating pain in lower back. NOT muscle, bone pain. Could not sit, laying down was worse, walking almost impossible. I have some pretty heavy duty meds for pain which I do not like taking but will if this continues. It is discouraging and disheartening that a med intended to help is so awful. And future effects? Who knows. I hope this helps someone be prepared for the possibility of this pain. Ask lots of questions, and good luck.",3
"Several months after Cancer treatment had Chemo, Radiation and Neulasta for Breast Cancer treatment. My bones in my legs and hands hurt like arteritis every day and are weak now. I did not have this before treatment. Trying to understand long term side effects now.    ",4
"I am wondering is there any studies out there that discuss long term effects of Nuelasta? I received Nuelasta in 2012-2013, and still experience bone pain. Not to the degree I did when I was getting the shots, but still have it. It is almost like an arthritis pain.",3
"I had a horrible experience with this drug. I got excruciating hip pain and the worst headache I've ever had in my life, and it lasted almost a week. Neupogen was a much better drug for me. I kind of think maybe this drug is best for a really heavyset man, but I think the one dose is just too much on my body. I would never take it again",3
"I just received my 5th neulasta shot after R EPOCH chemotherapy. Every time I get this shot the pain seems to increase. This time I even tried taking Claritin the day before and the day after. Well my pain is excruciating. My lower back and middle back and the ribs on one side of my back are VERY painful. I have been crying everyday and even oxycodone doesn't completely take it away. This is the 5th day since the shot and the pain is not easing up. I have been in bed for days and completely uncomfortable sitting, standing, walking (any position). Make sure you have adequate pain meds at home to cope with the effects of this drug. Especially as you get further out in treatment. ",4
"I had two injections, first brought only severe flu like pain, second gave me intense bone pain in my (legs now diminished somewhat after 6 months) severe lung pain shortness of breath continues after 6 months I am unable to walk more than 25 ft. without rest. After lung surgery I could walk and mow my lawn without problem the Dr. refuses to admit this horrible drug caused my condition. I may not live as the condition continues to progress.",1
after taking neulasta I now have to use oxygen. I would like to know how long I will have to be on oxygen.,2
Terrible hives after shot.  I have been experiencing hip & leg pain ever since and wonder if its a long term side effect.  Anyone else experience this?,1
"My husband has CLL and a wonderful oncologist. I appreciate the doc even more after reading these reviews. It prompted me to add our experience. Tony had a WBC of 80k and a spleen the size of a football at the start of chemo. He was put on an aggressive plan of fludarabine and rituximab. The first treatment he did NOT get the Neulasta. I assume there was a risk of spleen rupture. The next month he had his weeklong treatment and the doc told him to start taking Claritin on Thursday to prepare for the Neulasta shot on Monday (Chemo was Monday-Friday). He went back to the doc to get the shot Monday and prepared for the worst. He did get achy, but it really never progressed beyond a pain level 2-3. Like a flu, he said. The next round we repeated the same process with the Claritin, a 3 day break from all treatment, then the shot. This time it was a bit more troublesome, maybe a 4-5 on the pain scale. No pain meds were ever prescribed and my husband never felt he needed them, really. 4th round of chemo, we told the doc that the pain was significantly more the 2nd time and he cut the dosage of Neulasta to half, still took the Claritin for the 3 days leading up to the shot and for a week afterwards. No problems with that round at all. It really helped his WBC recover after therapy and since he works at a school, we were thankful that there was some reduction in his chance of getting sick. He did not get sick during the entire 5 months of chemo that occurred Jan-May 2015. Not even a cold! We will always be worried when he gets Neulasta as we believe it could 'turn on' him at any time. I am so sorry for all of you that have had terrible experiences. It seems that some of you should change oncologists. Ours was very deliberate in the way he approached these medications. Tony got full exams and a thorough 'how are you feeling' discussion before it was administered. We are on Tricare, which covered the cost of the drug, too. ",4
"After the Neulsta shot, all OK for about 2 days, then intense bone pain all over.  Called Doctor on a Friday evening and he said it was likely caused by the Neulasta shot.  Since I had some Norco-5 left over from gall bladder surgery just 2 weeks before I started Chemo, he said I could take some of those.  It barely took me from a 10 to maybe an 8 on the pain scale.  After two days hovering in intense pain, my husband read on line that some folks were taking Claritin for the side effects.  He gave me a Claritin 12 and within a half hour the pain subsided almost entirely.  What puzzles me is that the doctors don't seem to know much about this, but the nurses do.  When I went in for my blood work between chemo treatments, I mentioned it to the nurse, she said of course, either Claritin or Zyrtec would work for some folks.  Four days of intense pain could have been avoided if the Doctor had a clue.  I think Neulasta should be advising that if their is intense bone pain, patients should already be equipped to deal with it.  I had to do my own research, there's nothing in the literature from Neulasta that I could find that offered this suggestion.",5
"After 5 of 8 rounds of chemo, I am feeling side effects of this drug. On day 2 after chemo treatment started feeling flu like ache in my legs and abdomen. The worst overall is the stomach cramps. I've been taking Clariton every 12 hours and ibuprofen every 2-3 hours. Now 4 days since symptoms started, feeling better but not 100%. My advice is to be prepared-have Clariton and ibuprofen on hand. There may be side effects that may appear after several treatments. In the futute I will be taking Clariton the day before I get the Nuelasta injection.",4
"I go for chemo every 3 weeks., for 3 days chemo and shot 4th day... First shot, fine for about and hour, then ,I could not breathe went to ER... Second time, we figured I may need more fluid... That seemed to work..No problems...Then there was a break in treatment because of holiday, got shot,passed out. after 15 min. fine..... Today, had 600 liters of fluid, had shot, almost done with fluid and had passed out at the center... they sent me to er.... no one knows why this is happening...They can not figure it out... alll perplexed... I can take the chemo fine, like one nurse told the Dr.. she takes chemo like it is water.... Anyone else have this kind of reaction.",4
"I have done 3 rounds of 6 of chemotherapy and I take a shot of neulasta the day following my treatment. I have had no side effects to speak of. Around the 1-2 week mark I get some mild elbow joint discomfort and some inter muscular type sensitivity in my ribs, but nothing that prevent me from going about my day. For the record I am 42 years old, female, 160 lbs, 5'9"". I have a fairly good diet, don't drink or smoke and go for walks daily.  I have been told I may experience more of this bone pain on my next 3 rounds, as the cocktail is changing. I guess that's why they gave me the codeine, just in case.  I wish for a speedy recovery for all of you that are experiencing this in a painful way and for a healthy cancer free future. ",5
"I'm currently undergoing R-CHOP regimen chemo for DLBC Lymphoma.  After the 2nd round my white blood cell count dropped to 1 and my oncologist recommended neulasta.  I was given a written description of the drug and its potential side-effects.  I accepted the risks and had the injection 36 hours after I completed my infusion, and have done the same for each additional round of chemo.  The most I've noticed is a small soreness around the injection site, less than my last tetanus booster though.  This has been the case for all three rounds of neulasta I've received. Less quantifiable but something else I've noticed is that after starting neulasta it seems that my basal metabolism has been elevated.  All of my life I've had a lower than normal body temperature since I've been given neulasta its averaged a degree higher than its always been. ",4
"Originally when I used the full dose of Neulasta I had severe pain. The option at that time was to have daily shots of neupogen instead. MUCH less discomfort. Then I asked my oncologist if she could give me a lower dose of Neulasta so I would not have to come in daily for a shot. She agree to give half a shot to see how it would work. It works GREAT. No or little discomfort and only one trip 24 hours after chemo and one shot. If Neulasta hurts you badly, ask to try something different or a different way.",4
"I had my first chemotherapy treatment for Breast Cancer.  It was followed by an injection of this drug the next day.  About 6 hours after the injection, I began an intense 6-7 day migraine. My usual Imitrex would barely touch the pain.  I finally found taking an Imitrex and a Benadryl would  give me some relief. I also had some chest pains, bone aches, and dizziness. I found the migraine debilitating for at least 4 days.  All the rest was annoying, but completely tolerable.",3
"Treatment associated with MDS.  Neulasta provided longer lasting, more effective results than Neupogen (but had 24-48 hour side effects - tired, low fever, blood pressure/pulse flux) which subsided.  Restored healthier immune system level after 'neutropenia'.  Barely recovered from near critical staph infection (requiring surgery) when WBC & abs. neutrophil levels were too low (neutropenic), so we watch these numbers carefully....Neulasta has worked very well with just one treatment per month, but please post if you've discovered a better treatment...",5
"I think it has worked well, but am scared of it.   I have been given the shot DURING chemotherapy and everything I have  read says that it should not be given till  24  hours AFTER chemo.",4
"I have had a neulasta injection 24 hours after chemo treatment several times now. I didn't have any pain until the last one and it was miserable! It was like the worst migraine over my entire body, head, neck, jaw, back and hips ached constantly with no relief for 2 1/2 days.I took lortab and percocet and zyrtec. I was told to take claritin or zyrtec for body aches. The last sleepless night I took 2 Percocet and one zyrtec, finally the pain subsided and I slept. I have pancreatic cancer and have chemo every other week, but I can honestly say I have never had pain like this.I can see how some people could get suicidal, it's just that bad.",5
4 days after my shot I had EXCRUTIATING lower back.  I associated it with my Herpes. Dr didn't think so.  Second shot I had similar pain but it moved up my back and to my sternum. Ibuprofin helped but Drs say no vitamins which I would normally use to combat outbreaks.  Has anyone else experienced this?,5
I'm on my second round of chemo and I was required to take the Neulasta a day her my chemo. I've experienced pain beyond my wildest dream. I've experienced joint pain and extreme lower back pain. my oncologist prescribed me hydrocodone 500 and I'm still have chronic pain. I'm 45 yrs old and a mother of 3 and the pain is the worst I've ever felt. I've cried because the pain is so unbearable. ,2
"I have received Neulasta 24 hrs after each chemo treatment.  The 1st time, the nurse told me there might be ""some bone pain"" in the next 24 hrs.  5 days later, I had 36 hrs of horrific pain in my lower spine, hips & sternum.  Nothing helped.  My husband wanted to take me to the ER, but I wouldn't go.  After talking with the office nurse at my oncologist's & reading online, I found that the allergy med Claritin (Yes, Claritin) & naproxen, for some reason, help with the bone pain.  No one seems to know why, just that it works.  I now start taking 1 claritin &1 naproxen each morning starting the day of chemo & continue for 5 days until the bone pain is gone.  It makes it bearable.",4
"Initially I was given the injection a week after IV Chemo based on blood results that were consistently severely neutropenic. Finally Dr decided to give injection 24 hours after chemo. 1) Have the injection given slowly - much less injection pain. 2) Be Prepared for intense bone/muscle pain - to the point of not being able to sleep - tramadol helps somewhat, but the combination of post chemo side effects and the injection more than triples the side effects. I continue to take it as I can't afford to be immunosuppressed - but it takes its toll mentally and physically.",5
"Have had 2 rounds of chemo (AC+herceptin) for stage III breast cancer followed by Neulasta given a day later; also took 3 days of dexamethasone before, during & after chemo.  Round 1: 2 days later could hardly walk due to pain, not able to eat or drink, severe diarrhea. When I could not handle it anymore, called oncologist-on-call who told me to ""expect some pain w/ chemo"" and try Tylenol! Totally useless ""consult""! Ended up in ER same day for severe chest tightness, mediastinal pain, severe pain up spine to base of neck, severe hip & leg pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea - treated for dehydration & MI ruled out; fluids,IV dilaudid & hydroxizine helped alot! 3 days later, still not able to eat/drink, w/pain & nausea so went back to ER.  WBC was 0.  Given fluids, pain & nausea meds IV & a mask; needed to go back to clinic daily for IV fluids for 3 more days. WBC returned 6 days after Neulasta. Next week, short of breath and found to be anemic - needed IV iron. Considered taking my chances w/o chemo.  Round 2: My oncologist gave me long acting IV anti-nausea drug w/next chemo round and decreased one chemo drug by 15% to ""lowest effective dose"". 2 days later, immobile with pain & in bed for 5 days. But this time I had on hand at home-oral Dilaudid + Hydroxizine PAM (alternating w/ Ondansetron) & Gatorade, Pedialyte & broth.  Was able to get by with these at home but stayed in bed most of the week.  Round 3 coming up and oncologist suggested Claritin w/ chemo & Neulasta in addition to Round 2 additions. Side effects are hell and mine did not seem to be mentioned for chemo or Neulasta, especially the boa constrictor around my chest & total spine pain which others have posted here. Getting better each round so I will tough it out for now for my family.  Don't let clinicians discount your pain - make them address it until YOU are comfortable!",3
"I am receiving chemo for an oligo metastatic breast cancer.  The first time I received neupogen which gave me a dull achy pain that was tolerable.  This time I received a neulasta shot and hope I can talk my doctor out of it.  I received my port on a Monday, chemo on Wednesday, took my bandages off on the day of neulasta shot and the next day after that all hell broke loose.  I had severe burns and blisters where my bandages had been, my heart raced out of control, the pain was unbelieveable, I projectile vomited twice and felt like I had the flu complete with chills.  Oh, and did I mention the bloody nose?  After 10 days my white cell count was over 30!!!!  Seriously??  I went through all that so I can get leukemia?  I just hope my doctor will give me neupogen next time.  I have a painful bladder disease and can tolerate a lot of pain as I've been on methadone for 10 years.  Finally got off that and now am really depressed at the thought of having to take massive doese of percocet for this pain.",3
"I have had 3 of 8 chemo treatments and receive a Neulasta shot the day after chemo (more than 24 hrs).  I was well informed by my Oncologist and the infusion staff of the potential side effects and treatments.  My side effects have been relatively mild ....bad backache that begins approx 6 days after the shot and lasts for 2-3 days.  After the 1st shot, I did experience mild, flu-like symptoms for a day or so (again...about a week after the shot).  Those symptoms have not re-occurred. What saddens and disturbs me about some of the experiences posted here is many people seem to have been ill-informed of the possible side effects.  My doc (and again, the infusion center) was VERY CLEAR about all possible side effects and the possible SEVERITY of those side-effects (mild to intense bone pain....especially in the areas where bone marrow is concentrated - breastbone (some think they are experiencing a heart-attack), thighs, back.  I was WELL PREPARED. Doc was also VERY CLEAR that ALL SIDE EFFECTS...even the VERY SEVERE can be managed with OTC Ibuprofen OR IV pain relievers (she called it Ibuprofen on steroids!!), and that it was NOT ACCEPTABLE to have unmanageable pain.   As I said, thankfully my side effects have been relatively mild and the shot is doing its job...keep my immune system VERY HEALTHY! PLEASE talk to your doc if your pain is not managed by OTC methods.  You do NOT/SHOULD NOT have to suffer.  Fighting the fight with all of you and plan to BE A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR!!!  :-)",5
"This is the drug from hell!  I had 4 chemo infusions (AC)followed by Neulasta with no bone pain whasoever.  My 5th was Taxol and I got the worst bone pain of my life!  I couldn't sit, stand, lie down or even walk without being in excruciating pain.  Percocet worked for only two days.  I suffered another 2 days and then went to the  hospital for a much needed shot of morhpine.  I was then prescribed Dilaudit which I had to take for another 4 days.  My dr. figured it was the Taxol/Neulasta combo that did it.  This drug should not even be an option. It's effective but it's not worth the side effects.  It's only reason for use is to shorten the time between infusions from 3 weeks to 2 weeks.  I am now off this horrendous drug and waiting 3 weeks between infusions.  If your dr. says you need Neulasta, I would seriously look at other options.",5
"I didn't have any pain until day six. I hurt in my chest,back,hips,shoulders. It feels like I'm having a heart attack. Some times it will hurt each time my heart beats. I have never had bone pain like this. The nurse said I may have some bone pain but I never thought it would take this long to start and be so bad.   ",2
"Neulasta injection was given day following chemo. I felt really bad and hurt all over, joints, muscles, skin, etc. as though I had a bad case of flu. Before pain took over, I took hydrocodon-acetaminophen 5-500 every 4 hrs. I also took Zofran 8mg for nausea. In a few days,I felt better and best of all, the neulasta worked. Neutrophils were restored and I was able to continue chemo. Yes, I suffered a little, but the results were worth it!",5
"I had six chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer with one of these shots after each one. I had intense bone pian in my legs after each time, the pain lasting longer each time. My doctor put me on oxycodone, ibuprofen, and claritin. It worked great to control the main. My last shot was on June 1st, 2012 and I am getting the exact same pain not quite as intense randomly 1-3 times a week. Now I am wondering just how long the effects of this shot can last.",4
started to use this drug for chemo therphy starting to experience jaw pain on left side,2
"severe pain in joints, legs, muscles, arms, can barely stand on my legs for a long period of time. Right leg & foot also numb from this shot (neulasta). Terrible side effects.Aspirin didn't touch the pain & either did oxycodone....Still suffering from this terrible drug",1
I must say that I have the opportunity to compare my 1 shot every 2 wks to when I was a stem cell donor for my brother and was given heavy doses of the neulasta. No I do not like the aches in my bones. This weekend I will do very little. But next week I will be me again. The treatment is definetly not worse than the disease. ,5
Injected 24 hrs after last 2 of 4 chemos after lumpectomy of L breast. Didn't mind chemo but thought I would die within 1 hr of Neulasta. Was like flu but no vomiting. 2 - 3 degree rise in temperature for 1 week. Got infection but treated with antibiotics. Tossed and turned day & night with pain all over & sweating. Have always been active and strong but this brought me to my knees. Will start chemo again today but different injection other than Neulasta tomorrow. Makes you feel like giving up but the alternative (death) is much worse so will forge ahead. I should get rid of the medi-port after these next 4 IV's. Thank God I have a wonderful oncologist and surgeon. ,5
"I was given the option of neulasta or neupogen to aid in my neutrophil countdown while undergoing my latest rounds of chemo. With Dr.s aid I chose neupogen. I have to have injections everyday for 3-4 days following each chemo. However after reviewing these comment, I'm happy with my choice. Minimal side affects . Minor achiness but no major pain or increased vomiting. Everything that can go wrong has for me this last 6 months. Including incredibly low blood counts. Have had to postpone chemo many times before starting these injections. Now I'm golden. I highly reccomend speaking with your Dr. About neupogen rather than neulasta. ",1
"I received this injection the day after chemo. It was at the end of cycle 1.  It was the shot from hell.  I have NEVER experienced that type of pain before (I gave birth with no pain medication whatsoever). I hurt all over.  It hurt to breathe.  It hurt to move. I took acetaminophen to no avail.  I took ibuprofen to no avail.  The only thing that provided relief was vicodin.  I told my oncologist that if that is how it's going to be, I can't do it.  He listened and lowered the dose by half.  Subsequent shots have been much easier to tolerate.  I have mild pain which can be managed with ibuprofen and the shot raises my WBC to a range that is good.  I hope this post helps.  ",5
"If you are having bone pain, try taking a Claritin prior to the shot.  Many patients benefit from this and report much less pain.",5
Thumbs up for Nuelasta.  I've completed seven rounds of chemo (four rounds of two different cocktails) every two weeks and I'm ready to complete my final round of chemo this week and will be ready for surgery in a few weeks. I have never missed a chemo session and have taken Nuelasta 24 hours after each chemo session.  I have had good white cell counts with each round. I have experienced insomnia and mild aches and pains but with all the medications a chemo patient takes I can't attribute the insomina and shin splints to Nuelasta or if it's the steroids given during infusion.  Haven't been sick with flu or colds the entire period and love getting out and about.  I continue to take a healthly dose of calcium and drink at least 8 ozs of skim milk each day which may be the reason I have very little aches and pains.  ,5
"Terrible drug.  Bad side effets.  Rapid heartbeat & pulse rate 2 hours after taking.  Was told, just have to wait until drug wears off.  Went on for well over 2 weeks.  Could not sleep, eating was a problem Went to see Johns Hopkins doc, he confirmed Nulasta did it.  Said they don't give it at Hopkins. I would die before taking it again. At $3,000 to $7,000 a shot you would think they could do better. ",1
"This is the drug from hell.  Besides everyone else's pain/side effects I would like to add that I went deaf for 2 10-15 min. periods, and my head felt like it was in a vice for 6 days; seriously considered suicide but no bullet for the gun.  Arthritis areas felt like they were being ground with a mortor and pestal.  This was my first shot of this drug and it will be my last - death is better than the hell this drug does to you. I have given birth to 2 children with no pain medication, suffered migraines 24/7 for 20 years, and I would gladly have the pain from both for the rest of my life on a daily basis than take another dose of this drug.  My hearing is still not normal, will go to a dr. to have that checked, the chest pains were like having a heart attack, knees hurt where they never caused me trouble before...this is not worth it! If you have trouble with one dose, I wouldn't expect it to be any better with the 2nd one. Think twice about even taking this drug once!",1
2 people who have used this drug told me how painful it was and I was ready. I did not experience any pain or flu like symptoms. I have had  Neulasta 4times now. The last time my WBC went very high: 48.I was worried about this elevation but my MD told me not to worry. I probably won't  get it after my next treatment.,5
"I had this shot the day after my first chemo treatment.  24 hours after the shot I hit the bed and didn't get out of it for 3 days.  I had a splitting headache and felt like my insides were vibrating.  I ached from head to toe.  Got severe intestinal cramping. Finally my husband called the cancer center.  They said to treat the cramping like it was constipation.  Did so and then had diarrhea for 5 days straight.  9 days later, my blood count was way up, 17.9, so my doctor said he will cut down on the shot.  I'm tempted to try the 2nd round of chemo without the Neulasta.  I will for sure make certain that I don't get a full dose this time.",5
"Severe pain 1 1/2 days after injection down back and legs. Unable to sit, stand, lie etc. without severe pain. Had to use pain killers which helped only a little to be able to sleep.  I have only had one chemo treatment and after hearing other people with similar results not sure I will again take this medication.  I can not spend a week on pills when I treat patients and I need to work.  There must be another option.",3

i get this shot morning after chemo,5
"Like someone else who has written, YES, I feel like a nervous wreck, am shaking and feel VERY spacey.  My MD told me this was from the Morphine I take.  This cannot be so, as I've been on Morphine for years, and never felt like this.  I have had this drug TWICE now, and I am saying now that I WILL NEVER have it again.  True, it makes me feel more confident about going out in crowds, but I'd rather be a recluse than to feel like this.  I can also recall having chest and rib pain the last time I had it, but so far (only two days out now) I haven't had this yet.  Who knows what may happen, as the Neulasta seems to have long-term side effects--that is things show up days and even weeks after receiving this injection.  The caregivers at the place I go to make it seem like a foregone conclusion, that I will get this no matter what.  But I refused it once already, as my white count was about 7 and I didn't need it.  I am an RN and I know what a good white count is and a bad one.  You have to speak up and say NO, I don't want it.  They make A TON of money on this, so naturally they want to give it out.",4
I took neulasta from April 11 to July 31 2009.8 rounds of it tingly on day after injection & muscle-bone pain.It's almost 1 year from my last chemo & I have had constant pain in my right hip where I would get the injection any long term side affects from this drug?,4

"I am very angry with my Dr. and his staff for not giving me information about the side effects of this drug before hand. When I called to tell them about the pain I am in they said  ""That's Normal"" I have had a lot of pain in my life ,Herniated Disc 3 surgery's for that, natural child birth 2 times,and nothing has come close to the extreme pain I am in from this drug.The first few hours it started at my neck and headache then it has moved to all over my body, I have osteoporosis and bursitis in my hip and knee and at first thought that was what was causing my leg pain but it has never been this SEVERE! I will NOT be given this drug again and I will insist on information about any further Drug treatment they give to me.I have small cell Lung Cancer and have had four chemo-therapy treatments 3 days at a time.I had a Tumor on my neck that was choking me to death 8cmx3cm , The chemo has shrunk the tumor down and I greatly appreciate my Dr.s Efforts to save my life. But the quality of life is more important to me than the quantity. I want to be around for awhile,I'm 49 yrs old and have 5 grandchildren and another on the way in Sept.But to live in this kind of pain , how can I enjoy any time with them or even hold my new Grandaughter .My Advice to anyone is to ask questions and INSIST on answers.Make sure you know what you're getting into, I wish I had read the comments posted here before I took that shot. hind site is 20/20.Doctors should be required to give their patients all the information on any given drug and warn patients of side effects.",1
"Had shot after last treatment (4 of 6). WBC was 2.3. After shot, WBC went to 8.23. Achy back for a couple of days, nothing terrible. It's better than continuing to delay chemo because of low WBC. Dealing with the insurance company to get approval was the hardest part for me.",5
"I had a shot of this 24 hours after each chemo treatment I underwent for breast cancer in the fall of 2007.  I experienced no side effects, I was never ill during chemo and oddly, since that time, (almost 3 years) I have not had so much as a common cold.  I am wondering if there is a connection?",5
I recieved my Neurastin injection the day after my Chemo treatment and 2 days later had some minor flu like symptoms and bone pain in my hips and pelvic region for 3 days along with a chronic headache for 5 days. I used extra strength tylenol and only needed a narcotic to help me sleep one night. Over all it was very tolerable compared to wiping out the white cells. My follow up labs showed very favorable. ,5
"There was some mild bone pain and achiness and a slight headache.  Overall, nothing awful.  Sure beats getting ill from decreased white blood cell count.  I am a teacher and could not be around children who might be sick without taking the shot.",4

Four hours after the injection I had a bout with the most horrible diarreha I ever had, the pain was so intense I almost passed.  I was take to the e.r. by ambulance, the e.r. doc and my oncologist don't think it was realated to the shot, I am not sure I agree with them.  If my white counts are low when they are checked tomorrow I am seriously thinking about not having another shot.  The side effects from neulasta were worse than the chemo side effects.  After I read the patient information for neulasta I wonder why I did it in the first place.  Had I had that information before the shot I would not have had it.  I know there is higher risk for infection for me, so I am very cautious.  This drug does scare me, especially how it is made-this processs involves E Coli.",3
"I have had absolutely no ill effects from Neulasta. Maybe a little achiness around the injection site, similar to what I have with a flu shot. Other than that, no problems at all.  I realize everyone's experience is different, and there are many folks who seem to be having bad experiences with Neulasta, but I can't help wondering if some of the bad effects described haven't been from the chemo people are taking, and not the Neulasta. If you're taking two drugs at once, how do you know which one is causing the side effect? I had many of the symptoms everyone is describing, with the same onset timeframes (Day 3 after infusion), from my first round of Taxol, which is known to cause myalgia and arthralgia (muscle and joint pains). I had horrible arthralgia; so bad I was up all night and couldn't sleep. Tried 800 mg ibuprofen, nothing. Tried Vicodin. Nada. When I was able to get in contact with my oncologist, she prescribed dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, which provided complete relief within hours. Wouldn't your oncologist suggest that the side effects might be from your chemo and not the Neulasta?  I'm just saying, please make sure you've determined where your side effects are actually coming from so you can make an informed decision about using Neulasta or not.",5
"I had one round of chemo w/o Neulasta, and my white cells were nearly wiped out. I had a fever and felt awful for three days. With my second round, I received Neulasta the day after the chemo. The next day, I felt like I had the flu - bone aches (mostly my hips and pelvis, but also neck and long bones), and very bad headache. What worries me now is the abdominal pain I have this morning. I had stomach pain (mild) after the first round of chemo, and lost my appetite a little, but was able to eat. This pain sometimes doubles me over. I have been reading about the spleen damage that is rarely caused, and will call my doctor this morning. ",3
I had my first Neulasta treatment one day after my first chemo cycle. Two days later I had pain in my neck and shoulders that lasted for about 2 days. I took Advil for the pain.,4
"My mother was given an injection of Neulasta on the same day that she received her chemo treatment, which was 25 days ago.  She has been experiencing severe bone pain in her shoulders and arms for the entire time. She has also experienced serious itching.  We have informed her doctor and she simply prescribes pain meds and anti-histimine for the itch, but she still needs both frequently. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has had this severe of a reaction as I am quite cocerned.   ",3
"Was given this three days after my last dose of chemo. Was doing just fine, then sharp pains started shooting down my lower back into my legs. I couldn't sit, stand or lie down. Doctor gave me percocet 1-2 every 4 hours, but didn't help at all. By third day pain in my legs went away and moved up into my chest like a heart attack. This lasted 2 days. Now I have just finished another round of chemo and he wants to give me the shot again. DON'T KNOW!! This pain is worse than having a baby or my heart surgery. ",3
"I had the shot the day after chemo. About three hours after the first shot I felt like I had the worst flu ever.  My back, hips and legs HURT!  After three days, I was feeling better.  For the rest of the shots, took ALEVE before and after.  Didn't hurt that bad.  Didn't get the shot after my fourth treatment and my counts dropped really low and felt really bad.  Much rather have the shot.  Survived six rounds.",4
I have had three injections without any of the side-effects I had read about. Even my doctor says that this is unusual. Maybe the type of chemo and aggressiveness of treatment make a difference?,5
@White count still low after five rounds of Chemo and one Neulasta injection (They administered),3
"The first time I had the shot, I thought somehow I had injured my back.  The pain was so much more severe that they had led me to believe.  5 days after the second shot, I hurt so bad everywhere and for over a week that I am thinking twice about haveing it ever again.",5
Would not take again too much bone&joint pain.Just about can walk.,3
"I had the shot 24 hours after my first chemo treatment.  It was 3 days later when I experienced severe rib cage pain and shortness of breathe. It hurts to breath in deeply or to turn on my sides, or to cough. I do manage it with Ibuprofen 800 and at night I take the tylenol with codine to sleep better.  I had blood work done 6 days after the shot and my white blood count is down.  This makes me wonder if it is worth the pain?  ",2
"I have had only one injection and am seriously debating ever using it again. I am currently two weeks out from my injection and still having hip pain. Initially I had severe chest, hip and pelvic pain. Tylanol did not help and I instead needed narcotic medication to deal with the pain. My doctor has recommended Neupogen for my next round of Chemo. I'm still trying to decide if I'd rather have severe pain and one injection, or milder pain with daily injections for a week.",5
"I had neulasta 24 hours after chemo and within 12 hours I suffered  severe pain in my joints that left me unable to walk,sit or even stand for three days and I am still experiencing some pain -mostly in my knees 7 days later.The pain was severe enough that my dr called in a prescrition for vicodin,which offered me only a little relief but caused severe GI problems as well.I am having blood work done today so i dont know that staus but i am dreading my next treatment.",3
"I just got my first injection of Neulasta yesterday, I however, woke up with shakieness, like my insides were a nervous wreck.  I haven't had the bone pain, but I sure that is next.  It really knocked me on my rear.  I did great with the first round of chemo until this.  Has anyone every had that feeling, at all with this drug?",2
"The first injection I experienced flu like symptoms, the second injection had me down for days. The bone aches, and heart attack symptoms were unbelievable.  It actually was painful to put deodorant on.",5
"It is so painful on my legs and hips, I found it difficult to walk.  It was given as a shot in my arm the day after chemo.",2
"I've just received cycle 3 of 8 cycles of Chemo, with Neulasta injections 2 times.  I was NOT prepared emotionally for the intense pain, and debilitating effects of the Neulasta.  If I had not had help from my husband for even the simpliest tasks I don't know what I would have done.  I received my latest Neulasta injection 5 days ago.  I am finally starting to get some strength back, and don't feel AS winded.  My first round of Chemo didn't include Neulasta, and I went thru it like a breeze, but with Neulasta, not so good.  Looking down the road at 5 more cycles of Chemo, I just want to cry at the thought of getting Neulasta and it's side effects.  Any advice?",5
I received Neulasta the very same day I had my first chemo treatment.Now in what I have read that should not have happened. Three days later I had extreme pain throughout my body. In calling my oncologist he told me to up the Ibprofin. The following week I was in ER fighting for my life. It had ruptured my spleen. Seven units of blood later and emergency surgury I made it back to the living. I have quit chemo and turned to natural healing. Life is precious and you shouldn't have to almost die to get your health back. So whatever amount of time I have to live will be as pain free as possible. There is a local surgeon doing a case study on me at this time.,1
"The day after receiving an injection I was in the ER with severe chest pain. I thought it was a heart attack. After many tests, all negative, they beleive it was from the injection. I have refused future injections because it was very painful.",1
I had been using Neuprogen for over 3 years taking a shot every 4 days.  I asked to be placed on Neulasta and each week after the first injection my white cell and neutrophil counts were in the normal range. At the end of three weeks my numbers were still good and better than i was getting after only four days on Neuprogen.  I have never experienced any side effects so these two drugs have saved my life.  I only regret that I am not permitted to take the Neulasta shot myself as Medicare will not pay for it unless I go to a Doctor's office.   ,5
"My mom is experiencing horrible, debilitating back pain for 10 days now.  Actually been admitted into the hospital.  Could not eat, drink, sleep, or walk for 4 days before being admitted.  Have been given Percoset every 3 hours for 3 days - no relief.  Now being given Morphine every 12 hours along with Dauladin (10 times stronger than Morphine) every 2 - 5 hours with some relief, not complete relief.  This is HORRIFIC!  The doctors completely underestimated the pain and told us to give her Tylenol when the Percoset didn't work - WHAT!?  I agree, with the other comment.  If you don't get in front of this pain, it is too late.  Before the next round we will start on the morphine 2 - 3 days prior so it has time to build up in the system and be ready at the first sign to attack it or be admitted into the hospital for pain management under monitored circumstances.  She became suicidal from the pain before we finally convinced the ER doctor to admit her.  The oncologist knew this and sent her home with more Percocet.  Why not give her a loaded gun?  If you are older, in poor physical condition, or have any bone problems like arthritis or osteoporois have a pain mgmt plan in place before starting the chemo.  Build up your muscles with weights prior.  Then hold on and be strong!",3
"The first time I got the shot it was as they say, mild bone pain. The second and third time were soooo awful. After 24 hrs my bones, muscles, skin, you name it hurt head to toe. I could not be touched. It was all I could do to roll over in bed. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. I understand an infection can be deadly and that the two days of debilitating pain were better than death. But I definately had to be talked into that last dose by my doctor, and if it came down to me getting that shot again or coming down with cholora, berry-berry some deadly infection or whatever I would probably take my chances. A body can take just so much.",5
"Bone pain for a couple of days, one week after the first injection.  This was handled with pain pills, and I never hurt with subsequent injections.  Medication seems to have done what it is supposed to.",5
"My experience was similar to the one above by Rose, the only difference is I suffered from the most acute migrane ever. I was literally down for 3 days. The pain so severe I could not think, I too experienced some deep back bone pain but compared nothing to the migrane. I found that once the pain is so severe it is too late to manage it. This being a side effect not too many patients seem to suffer from. I agree too with Rose far worse than the treatment itself, something else to raise the blood count has to be done for I am not in it for round two, I would rather live in a bubble.",2
For me --this was the drug from hell! Right after my first shot I had a general ill feeling--exaustion and aches . Woke the next morning with pain throughout my body--bones--muscles--even skin hurt!! The Back of my head-neck-shoulders and upper back were swollen and sore to the touch --so hard to even lay my head on my pillow---sharp stabbing pains throughout my body and spine and for extra measure flu symptoms to boot. Four days of pure misery culminating with a trip to th ER Easter night with sever lower back pain with shooting sprays of pain in lower back to hips & down my legs to the back of my knees. There must be a better option for someone already dealing with Chemo and it's effects --which by the way were much milder than the Neulasta! I will ask to be taken off this drug at my next doctor visit.,1
"As an aside, someone had mentioned that ""you may have achy feelings like you have the flu"".  Sure do, but it's better than getting an infection.",5
this drug was the most painful drug i ever had.after 24 hrs i felt like knives were being stabbed into my legs and then shoulders.finally got relief from perkaset.it takes about 7 days to be free of the side effects although mt white blood count is remaining high i just look forward to the last treatment this week,5
"I never had any reaction to this drug, but I know it helped me significantly as I never had the tired, weak, feeling after treatment.  It allowed me to carry on with normal activities, including traveling.",5
"I received this medication in preparation to donate blood stem cells for my sister who has AML.  The injections caused some nasty headaches, mild nausea, and some leg pain. The pain wasn't touched by Tylenol so we had to switch over to oxycodone. Overall though, the pain was so worth it as I was able to successfully donate 6.97 stem cells in just two five-hour sessions. ",5
"Terrible Pains on my right  lower rib, pains on my right hand shoulder, blood in the urine and headaches. had on three injection Friday Saturday and Sunday",3
I have been taking Neupogen injections for my entire life due to my Neutropenia. The medicine is effective but it comes with it side effects. It has given me chronic back pain and joint pain which gets worse as I age. I would assume the benefits seem to out way the pain.    ,5
"I've been taking filgrastim which is Neupogen for 3 days now and I will be receiving 2 more shots tomorrow and Monday the day of my donation. Yes, I fortunately I'm not suffering from cancer and any disease. But I was found dead to be a match with someone that currently is fighting lukemia. And everyone deserves a chance at life and I was lucky enough to be chosen. Back to the medication side effects, I'm feeling like a throbbing pain from my neck to my tailbone. Definitely unpleasant but I'm really trying to tough it out and not take any pain medication. I'm sure my pain is nothing compared to someone suffice from this illness.   ",3
"breast cancer,chemo and surgery completed. unable to use legs as before neupogen  shots. no relief from pain meds such as tylenol, hydrocodone, ibuprofen. pain never ends no matter what i take.excercise noneffective",2
"Treated 6 months for hodgkin, mid term had problem with white cell count, corrected by 2 shots, each time 5 days before chemo. Had once backpain for 6 hours tolerable without medication, at the time of chemo white cell levels were always OK after neupo.",5
I received neupogen injections at least three times a week for 6+months. As a result I have limited leg mobility. Since I have been in remission from cancer I have been disabled due mainly from these neupogen injections. I will say though if I had not received them I could not of gotten my chemo treatments on time as scheduled so I'm sure the trade off was worth it. I just get really frustrated with the limited use of my legs and the horribloe pain I still get from these in jections.,3
The stares tell the story,4
the next two days I feel ill from taking this drug,3
"It works quickly and effectively to boost the neutrophils. It sometimes makes me vomit and gives me ulcers in my mouth. There are flu like symptoms about 8-10 hours after the injections that last 8-10 hours. Occasional ""bone marrow pain"" i.e. throbbing. I suspect it is related to increased depression also however I cannot find that mentioned in the literature. ",5
"I have sjogren's syndrone and have been experiencing low white counts over the course of many years.  I have been given neuprogen in the past to help fight infection.  I am now on a regimen of 300 units every two weeks.  My counts have increased.  My side affects are weakness, especially in the legs and low grade pain in my bones.  I also seem to be retaining fluid.  I am thankful that this medication is availabe to help keep my counts up.",3
"On Aug 15,2012, I was unable to have chemo treatment due to low neutrophils in white blood cells. I was given the first shot of neupogen, followed by 2nd and 3rd on following 2 days. After the first shot, I had severe pain in lower back, as well as, pain in other joints. I felt terrible in general, with swelling in some joints and low grade fever.  I took hydrocodon-acetaminophen 5-500 to relieve pain.  The pain subsided in 3 days.  I found side effects of neupogen worse than neulasta. I had chemo again the following two weeks when neutrophils were low again. My Oncologist decided to give 4 neupogen shots spread over 4 days rather than 3 days.  It worked beautifully. I just finished the 4th shot yesterday and feel fine. I feel tired and a little weak, but no pain medication was necessary during the 4 days. If not for neupogen, I would not be able to have chemo as my immune system was too low. I am grateful for neupogen and neulasta (which I have had in the past).  They do the job of restoring neutrophils in white blood cells which allows me to have chemo to kill cancer cells. The question is do I want to suffer a little to achieve my goal of having chemo to extend my life?  Yes! I do.",5
"On HCV treatment therapy-Low WBC's Neutrophils expected range 1500-7800_ Mine 610 ""one 300mcg Neupogen injection went to 11,674 ""Wow"". But, med decreases to about 50% in 2 days. Occasional tolerable body aches,feels a bit weird. Slight short nausea, may try leg INJ. I read Neutrophils are like the Cops attacking and killing the bad guys on site. With Neutrogen,the cops are on steroids. To much Neutrogen they turn into the ""Keystone cops on steroids with sloppy over kills. The Blood work is important. Over all we are lucky to have a drug that does something so important as to save us from infection with minimal side effects. So take it, deal with it, kill those bad guys, keep up with the blood work, Good Luck",5
Up all night in screaming pain Tylenol not touching it May stop chemo if I have to continue this med,4
"I have taken 480mcg (the higher dose, there's a 300mcg dose too) for three sessions now - they brought my neutrophils, white blood cell count and hematocrit all up - really well! I had one evening of pulsing pain starting from lower back - real misery, but got permission to take ibuprofen and even just 400mg of that knocked the pain out. Have also had extreme pain on defecation once. Aside from these two, and only one lasted a few hours, all subsequent treatments have not really increased joint pain much. They *have* increased nausea/acid/gas, but meds help that. Just keep on the ondonsatron and you'll be ok.",5
"I am the patient's neice.  We only started the inj this past thursday, so the above questions really do not apply at this time.",1
Suffer from severe chronic neutropenina.  Have been taking this drug since 1998.  I has changed my life.  It does cause bone pain but I've lived with this so long that I really no longer notice it.,5
"I started my chronic Hep C treatment with Rivabirin 1000mg a day and PegInterferon 180mcg a week, after 2 weeks I already develop very low white blood cell counts bellow 20%, started once a week Neupogen by Roche lab 0.5ml/ 30mu single dose syringe subcutaneous, my white blood cell count went up IMMEDIATELY in 24hrs  as opposed as other generic versions of this drug which took 4-5 days to bring count up, sadly most insurance companies will not give you brand name, shame on system, when they have such different effectiveness rates, real shame cut cost in such a great drug.Cost is about $200 a dose/week with no insurance. Worth it. No side effects at all, been on this for about 2 months, and probably will be for another 5 months.  Excellent drug! Note bring to room temperature b4 injection and no sting will be felt, doesn't loose pharmacological properties for to this. ",5
The only part of this Drug that I found to be unsatisfactory is the joint pain.,5
every since my son has started this treatment his counts has increased and our ER visits has decreased greatly. The only pproblems we are having now is the nosebleeds.,5
"My mother in law injects me once a day for a 5 day run each cycle of chemotherapy. The injection doesn't hurt much at all. I didn't have any side effects until my 5th shot. I have experienced pulsating pain in my lower spine and some other bones. Nothing a Tylenol can't take care of. Also I had a headache (but not sure if that is related or not). Overall, piece of cake.",4
"Severe, crushing headaches until I went gluten-free due to an auto-immune condition (Hashimotos thyroiditis).  Now getting a small headache, but neutrophils not going up.",2
On the 7th day of a ten day injection regimen. Two injections of 300 mg/l and one of 480 mg/l daily. Having bone pain in the hips and occassionally the skull.

"My mom has been getting a shot over a period of 2wks. Since she has been getting this med, she is experiencing severe headaches with right jaw pain and facial sensitivity.  After receiving a shot today, she has developed a reddened ring around her right eye (looks like a black eye). She is due for another shot tomorrow but I am going to ask the doctor to recommend another treatment remedy because she is really not feeling any better at this juncture.",3
My wife got an injection of this after an allergic reaction to a sulfa drug for Urinary Tract Infection which killed off nearly all of her white blood cells. She was a mess. One shot of this drug did the trick. The count when 1.4 to 12 in about a day. It leveled off to about 9.,5
helps in recovery during chemo. blood count bottoms out a week after treatment but with the meds it stabalizes a couple of days later. Very effective.,5
I have experienced joint pains while on neupogen but for the most part it was tolerable.,5
"In 1994 a blood test revealed an almost zero neutraphil count from unknown causes but which was eventually attributed to ""auto-immune neutrapenia"". Neupogen was prescribed in 1995 and I have been on it ever since then. At present an inj of 1 cc twice a week maintains my blood count within acceptable limits ",5
"Been on injections every other day for almost a year. I am a flight attendant for a living so when I work I am subjected to all kinds of bacteria and germs. This drug has been a life saver for me as when I was younger in the 80's I would be in isolation in the hospitol over and over since back then nothing could raise your white count. It has enabled me to have a normal life without becoming deathly ill. (Which happened prior to this drug.) I find that the lower my count is, the more I feel the side effects. So at times it is worse than others.Nothing too bad, just headache and some pelvic pain. This starts about 5-6 hours after I inject. It is aways gone by morning. As long as I stick to my schedule I do well. I can inject better with larger syringes as they hold more and I can inject it faster. The insulin syringes are more awkward...but are free with the script! Just make sure you always take your shot out of the fridge about 20 min before you inject it as it doesn't sting as much when it is room temp. ",5
"I injected myself, stomache area, six times from Tuesday through Sunday.  My White count was very low.  Tuesday night was bad. Pelvic area and lower back pain. Wednesday and Thurs bad too.

"I have to take shots everyday, I have been on it daily at a lower dosage for about 4 months now, and I have now developed a great deal of pain in my kidneys and have started bruising so easily.

"The 1st 2 weeks on Nexavar I had a rash everywhere! My oncology team adjusted the meds, & I am back at full dose again. Tea Tree Oil Shampoo really helps with the rash side effects. I am coping with the diarrhea by using Metamucil which bulks it up, so much better than taking another pill!  ",3
"Renal cell carcinoma..left kidney removed w/lymph nodes (Stage 4), 9/28/09. Start ECOG Clinical Trails, I believe I'm on Sorafinib. The side effect are: diarrhea, mouth sores, hand & foot syndrome, rash on my head, lossing hair, My feet are the biggest problem. I have multiple blisters on my feet that are very painful. I work at a desk job and can still work. If I had to be on my feet for work, I would not be able to work. It's still to early to tell if it's doing any good.",3
"Renal cell carcinoma..rt kidney removed w/lymph nodes, Dec 2008. On Sutent, ruptured my sigmoid colon. CT showed cancerous abdominal lymph nodes. Went on Nexavar Feb 2009. All the listed side effects (except heart attack)..diarrhea, nausea, mouth sores, hand & foot syndrome, rash from head to toe, hair (all head & body) gone.. very, very miserable.  Took only 2 pills a day (half dose).  P.E.T. scan in October showed the metastic lymph cancers were gone. Had my colostomy reversed Nov 2009.  Going on maintenance dose  (one per day) and hoping for the best.",5
"It is 12-03-09, I put a review in on 7-27-08. I am still on nexavar for advanced renal cell carcinoma and tumors are still gone. I still have problems with hand and foot syndrome. I forgot to add in my first review that my teeth became loose and my gums hurt and began to bleed. I had top and bottom partials so I had my teeth pulled and that took care of that problem. Also my hair started to fall out but it stopped and went into tight curls-has remained that way for 1 1/2 years. I am still a believer in the power of nexavar. It may not be for everybody but it is working for me.",5
"I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy after seeing what it did to my father. He took Nexavar for two weeks. On the second week he became very ill, vomited, could not control his bowel movements nor walk. The doctor prescribed this poison after he devoloped end stage liver cancer. After the second week the doctor took him off of Nexavar and gave him a week to live, on his last week he had Dementia, was screaming in agony and had stupors. He finally died from pneumonia and liver failure. I was very close to him.",1
Even though my husband was only on this for 2 months it did nothing but make the little time he has miserable.Maybe it was too late but his tumor went from golf ball size to covering his whole liver during that time.I hope it does help someone.,1
unfortunetly I came down with blood clots in my lungs as well as in the main artery.  This situation was life threating and I was forced to stop taking nexavar.  My cancer has subsided but am not sure the risk is worth the gain.,4
i lost my hair with the tretment and that was the only side affect i had.,5
"two weeks on Nexavar, feet starting to get hot spots and is hard to walk.  No other bad effects.  takng 800 mg daily.",3
I have cancer liver cancer and been on nexaver for 3yrs. I am more than satisfied with this drug.I fell this drug is keeping me alive.         ,5
"my husband has metastatic renal cell cancer, he started with tumors on his collar bone, esophogus, skull, lungs, diaphragm, and had right kidney removed. nexavar seemed to be keeping everything stable for about 3 years and the only side effects were diarrhea and a rash on hands and face which subsided after reducing the dose. for some reason unknown it had quit working and a bone scan revealed a new tumor growth eating through my husbands upper thigh bone. nexavar was stopped and he was put on chemotherapy drug Torisel, which seems to be keeping it stable so far but its only been 6 months.",2
My husband has been on Nexavar for 2 weeks and is having terrible side effects - hands so raw and sore he cannot touch anything and mouth sores so bad he cannot eat. Its way to early to tell if it is working for us - but I do not know how much longer he will be able to stay on it. They say some of the side effects go away in time but I am not sure he will make it long enough to see if that happens.,1
"I have angiosarcoma of the head and neck. I have had several tumors removed, been on chemotherapy for 2 years and had 33 treatments of radiation. This year we found 2 tumors on my brain and removed them with the Cyberknife. The chemo I was on was: Doxil, Taxol and Avastin. This year they put me Taxol and Avastin but my legs went numb, so my doctor put me on Nexavar.  I have several blisters on feet, my hands hurt, my mouth and scalp hurt, and for the first time, am not able to work because of the pain. I have been putting Bag Balm on my feet as told by my doctor, and this helps as it keeps the skin softened, but still hurts too bad to stand on for 8 hours.",2
"Right kidney removed 4-21-06. CT 4-11-07 showed multiple tumors in both lungs. After approval from ins. co. started Nexavar on 5-15-2007. Had hand foot syndrome, sore mouth, constipation but tumors shrank in 3 mo and were gone in 6 mo.I was off work for 5 mo then went back to work as side effects backed off. It is 7-27-08 and tumors are still gone. I know nexavar works. It may not be for everyone but I was in good health until tumor was found in right kidney. My diagnosis is advanced renal carcinoma (Clear cell type). ",5
My grandfather used this medication and it made him super sick and he had every side effect this medication has. It made what time he had left with his family very long and miserable for him.,1
"Had metastatic Kidney Cancer three years ago and had the left Kidney removed.  Clean for two years until a brain CT revealed 12 small mets.  Did three weeks of Radiation and put on Nexavar.  Now a year later and still clean.  Side effects passed after a time.  Lost 65lbs, from 268lbs. to 203lbs.  Very weak and tire quickly.  It's getting better, however.  I think it's working!.

I HAVE 7 METAS. RC TUMORS. I HAVE BEEN USINGS NEXAVAR FOR 4 YRS. IT HAS HALTED THE GROWTH OF ALL THE TUMORS AND NEEDLESS TO SAY BUT IT HAS SAVED OR PROLONGED MY LIFE. THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE STRONG BUT YOU CAN LEARN TO LIVE WITH THEM. IN TIME SOME OF THE EFFECTS CALM DOWN.   [email protected] ,5

"have been on it for approx 3 weeks. how lonf before you know its working. my cancer is everywhere. responded to taxol well for about i yr. primary site unknown. docs felt it was kidney,liver or abdominal",1
This drug was used to treat metastatic liver cancer. The major side affects were blisters on the bottom of my feet and the palms of my hands. It also caused sores and tenderness on the inside of my mouth and tongue.It also caused diarrhea. I had to stop taking the drug because of the side affects.,3
THE MAIN SIDE EFFECT I'M HAVING IS DIARRHEA. ,4
Hot flashes are my worst side effect. Being tired is a given since this suppresses testosterone. Some moodiness when tired. Not much to complain about since it's working. ,4
Took drug for 3 months at half the recommended dosage and it took my PSA reading down to 0.3. Could have a glass of wine each evening and sex was an option but not great.,5
"I had every bad side effect there was, stomach problems, throwing up, if I was in the sun too long everything I looked at was green.  I was only on this medication for 30 days, I was glad to get off it and it did not help me at all.  On this medication my psa went from 12 to 24 in one month.",1
"only on it for 2 months, but suddenly after no side effects had extreme fatigue and high blood sugar readings(I have diabetes). Was admiited tot he hospital with congestive heart failure, lung obstruction and acute kidney failure. The Drs feel this is a result of the drug. I wa otherwise in excellent health.",2
"apart from a short period at the beginning of my treatment I have had no trouble with this drug. It is now 3 years later I have muscle pain in my lower legs, which my doctor thinks may be a side affect.Does anyone suffer this problem.",5
"QT Interval, headaches, itchy head, and bumps on skin and head, tiredness, fullness on left and right sides, under breast.",2
"Just finished my seventh cycle along with dexamethasone. For me it was way more tolerable than Pomalyst, kyprolis, or Velcade. Having said that, all worked for me .",5
I have taken only my first week so therefore I will write a review in 3 more weeks to see where im at,1
after 6 treatments I developed Type 1 diabetes.  will continue treatment.,5
"I have been taking it for 8 months.  Stage 4 in both lungs and three tumors in the brain.  Brain tumors eradicated with radiation before starting lung treatment. I had a small outbreak of hives after first two treatments, nothing since.  PET scan after 3 months showed no active Melanoma. Two scans since showed no cancer whatsoever. Naturally couldn't be happier. ",5
after a few months on the treatment had to start taking medicine for thyroid function. then a few months later prednisone prescribed because creatine levels off. No other bad side effects. ,4
Brings my numbers up but I am sick for a week after Diarra fatigue severe leg and hip pains. Lasts 3 to 7 days. Then I just start to feel better time for a shot again. It makes me not feel like me. It does keep me safe in numbers I am now holding at 200000 for 3 wks so that helps to give me more good days then bad. Hoping this will now go to 4 wks since I am holding a little longer. Been on it since March 2016.,4
"ITP presents after pneumonia. Dr. sent me to cancer center. They stated I had cancer but they only treating me for ITP (NPlate). Then said I don't cancer. Doctors utterly confused. Have been getting shot each week for 5 years, platelettes up and down sporadically, also prescribed Vitamin D2 which is known to be far less effective than D3. (But they cannot prescribe D3, the natural version of the D2 synthetic, so no money to be made.) Lost job in May, switched to OTC Vit. D3, have not had shot since then, no symptoms. They begged me to come back, told me I would die! Advised no job, no $$, no insurance. They were ADAMANT that I MUST have shots!!!! Injured arm in August and blood clotting was normal. Cancer Center accidentally sent insurance bill to my house. Shots are billed to insurance at $15,600 per shot!!!! That's $4,056,000 in five years time. Seems like this whole deal is a HUGE money-making scam. They refused to sign any paperwork stating I had cancer after two doctors told me I did. They have proved NOTHING to my satisfaction. ",2
Tried Nplate October 2014 Got 3 blood clots after the first few injections. the Dr. told me to take aspirin and stay on the Nplate. Amgen Rep said it was impossible that could happen. Took it for a total of 14 weeks and the clots spread up my leg to my groin area. The Dr. took me off the Nplate and put me om blood thinners for 3 months and also prednisone to keep my platelets up. The D-Dimer test showed that a foreign substance in my body triggered the clots and said it had to be the Nplate after 3 months clots gone d-dimer showed everything excellent. Had other side effects that made my life miserable for many months! Not happy with the drug Nplate or the company Amgen who says its just a fluke. Found a few others who had the same problem with clots after 3 shots clots in both legs! I'm in the process of using a top law firm to pursue the matter since Amgen doesn't care!  ,3
"I Have been taking N-Plate for about 2 years but count seldom more than 30,000. At first i noticed no side effects but now i suffer joint-pains in arms and neck and back,also tingleing in my fingers and tiredness and sometimes a general feeling of unwell.I also have Arthrites and i am not if this also contributes to the problem",3
au bout de 4 ans soignée avec ce traitement NPLATE ne répond plus et mes plaquettes sont basses  20.000  15.000  10.000  5.000  1.000,4
"I have had shots every week for 55 weeks.  Just 2times in all that did my platelets reach 290,234 other wise I am no higher than the 30's and as low as 11.  I keep waiting for a miracle....who has it?",1
"I was diagnosed with ITP in 1999. I have always responded well to steroids and they have held me at a normal level.  My platelets recently dropped to 0 and I did not respond to steroids.  I was given the Nplate injection and I immediatly responded.  My platelets went from 0 to 580,000 in a period of just a few days.  However, I experienced side effects from Nplate to a very painful degree.  The headaches I experienced were so severe I ended up in the ER twice just to manage the pain.  I also experienced severe joint/muscle pain, tingling in hands and feet, hands and feet would get very cold during the headaches.  Any stimulation to my head or joints (cold or hot} felt like two magnets coming together pulling each direction.  There is really no way to emphasize in words the pain of the headaches and the shoulder/neck pain.  It has been over a week since I received the injection and my side effects are just now starting to subside.  Still dealing with severe neck and shoulder pain/tightening, and the headaches are finally dulling.  Nplate saved my life but I don't know if I could ever put myself through the pain of the side effects again.  Mainly the headaches.",5
"When this nplate first started out here. I been on it since. I have seen a raise of my count. But not enough i can be in normal stage. One time i was up to 76,000plelets wonderful. But in three weeks it drop down to 27,000. I am trying my best not to give up. But after i recieved my dosage this past week. It went in normal stage. But later on i get tired, sleepy, and have to lay down. The next day i have energy and do what needs to be done for that day too. The side effects it does give me is a little mood swings,boost of energy but not long,some pains in joint, but it is not going to long. Sometimes i can sleep and sometimes not. But like i said it will work but not for long to keep me in normal stage.",3
I have been taking Nplate now for 4 weeks and my platelet count has gone from 32K to 121K. I am having some side effects from the drug. I am unsure if I am going to continue the treatment. There have been no long term studies with humans about this drug.,3
"I have had low platelet count for nine months that I know of. (range 40 to 14). Have a weekly injection of NPlate since July 1. Platelet count remains at 24 to 32 side effects headaches and dizziness, low energy level. ",3
I STARTED OUT WITH A PLATELET COUNT OF 31. AFTER 6 WEEKS THE COUNT WAS 296.,5
"This drug helped me get through surgery to remove brain tumor.  After weekly injections for three months, my count was high enough for surgery.",5
"After only three treatments with this injection my platlets have remained within normal range. Last injection given to me was Feb 2011 and my platelets continue to thrive. However, I still get monthly blood work to monitor my platlet levels. So far, no bad experiences.",5
I started with a count of 2 and after just one week at the lowest dose I had a count of 73 which has been sustained since.  I have had no side effects at all and am very happy self injecting three weeks out of four attending clinic the fourth week.,5
I am a test subject for Melanoma that 3 months after it was removed from my back it has now appeared in my left gludius maximus(I am no medical speller) I am at the end of just my second treatment going in this week for two more days. It does cause me to really rearrange my schedule with other doctors but it offers me more hope that anything else. Fatague began within 8 hours of day one and more so the second day. Tried to nap but I developed restless legs. I would be only too happy to share the rest of the process if I got a note from someone.,3
"I started on Opdivo and had very little side effects in the beginning. My pet scan in 6 months showed that may cancer had spread and more spots showed on my liver. At this time they added Yervoy with the opdivo. This combo was just approved right before i stated taking it. I had two dose of the combo drug and got very sick. I experienced most of the rare side effects. 1st it was the colitis which landed me in the hospital for about 1 week with severe dehydration. Next was swelling of my knees it was so severe it they needed to be drained weekly. Next side effect was Stephen Johnson's syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis which basically almost killed me. The toxic rash spread over 90% of my body and I was not responding to meds. Three weeks in the ICU burn unit and I was told I could no long have the immunotherapy. Almost 6-7 months of just heeling, I had another pet scan that showed the tumor had spread to another area. At this point i still needed to heal and they scheduled a new pet scan in three months. So the week before Christmas this year, we had that scan, for days later I was given the results. The immuniotherapy worked, I was CANCER FREE! These meds made me very very sick and almost killed me but in the end, I am a 45 year old father that will be able to see his children grow up! The road is not easy and some of us don't make it out but It is the only chance those of us with Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma have.    ",5
"My dad had been fighting for over a year, started in lung, mets to other areas.  6 mo's of chemo and 3 separate rounds of radiation (80 days total).  My dad started opdivo 12/21/17, second dose 1/4/18.  After the second dose, he started going downhill bad.  He wasnt this bad after 6 mo's of chemo!!!!  After the 3rd dose, his abdomen started bloating in the liver area, he got weak, then had facial drooping.  We told the oncologist and he suggested steroids then another dose after a week delay.  One more dose, my dad was barely walking, slurred speech, barely eating, increased edema in abdomen and legs. Then at 4am, my mom calls me.  My dad somehow made it to the kitchen and couldnt stand, couldnt walk, could barely talk!!!!  We called an ambulance and sat in ER, then admitted to hosp.  The next morning, he was transferred to the local VAMC, palliative care floor.  He died 2 days later.  I do not believe opdivo was working, but rather attacking healthy cells instead of the cancer!!!! I will never ever recommend opdivo to anyone!!!   Opdivo killed my dad.  I think if they had just stayed with regular chemo he would still be alive!!!",1
Took a tumor off my spine and left me cancer free,5
"Opdivo has been a miracle for me, giving me my life back and improving quality of life and function. ",5
"After 2 weeks of administering this drug, my husband was dead.  I truy believe Opdivo was the reason.",1
"After chemo therapy wasn't working, my oncologist suggested this treatment option.  It was easy to use other than having to go into the fusion center to receive this treatment.  I am still on this treatment  but am waiting for a PET scan to see if this has been effective or not.",3
The side effects were severe especially for the last two weeks of a 6 month regimen.  The straw that broke the camel's back was when I lost my hearing and equilibrium at that time.Six months later I have regained most of both. ,4
"This is my 2nd phase of treatment for this 1 type of breast cancer.taxol is slowly wearing me down.  My hands have been peeling,my throat is sore and my voice is very raspy. The pain in my hands and feet are starting to be too much. I have 7 more rounds of the taxol, 12 total.  My hair hasn't came back yet and I still have a very sensitive mouth and sores in it still. It also makes me extremely and I mean extremely tired. ",3
"Had no hair loss or nausea from this med. I did have mild muscle and joint discomfort in my legs,feet arms and hands.Had four sessions of this med. It seems my fourth session was when the muscle pain began. ",4
"Taking the medication hasn't been bad, but the side effects when added to the ones one expects (nausea, hair loss) can be overwhelming. It did lower my white blood cells and had to be adjusted after the fourth session.",3
"inoperable adenocarcinoma, taken with carboplatin and concurrent radiation. Tumor shrank almost 50%. PET shows no active cancer 6 months after treatment",5
"This chemotherapy has been fairly well tolerated by my spouse ie. minimal nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.  The overall recovery time to feeling better after transfusion is 2-3 days as opposed to other chemotherapy which caused more profound fatigue and thrombocytopenia like Gemzar.  Overall, my latest CT showed marginal progression of the cancer however the lymph nodes are slightly larger/",3
I took this medication for 6months. I also took milk thistle and dandelion supplements. It has been almost 8 yrs later and my doctors say I am free of the virus. ,5
"I was so weak, it felt like I had the flu all the time. Food tasted awful,I had no appetite. All I wanted to do was sleep. I went into remission after I gave myself 48 weekly shots in my stomach along with bunches of pills. I had a 3 month blood test, it was good but I was so weak. I had my 6 mo blood test and my HepC was back.I was crushed. After nearly a year of feeling awful,it was back, I still had no energy, and to be honest I have never gotten my energy back after 8 years.",1
"you have to stay postive about treatment before and doring and don,t be afade first dose will make you sick like haveing the flo for first 24 hours then IT gets easyer",5
"I was diagnosed in summer of 2002.  Started treatment December 2002.  48 wks of hell resulted in total remission for 8 years.  Try milk thistle, a good, excuse me, GREAT attitude,a lot of gatorade and water, and especially a few good friends that you can repeat yourself over and over and they don't think your nuts!!  ",5
"I was on treatment for a year and had bad side effects. I met with the specialist on a regular but he continued to encourage me to stay on the treatment. I lot of time I wanted to give up.  However, I completed treatment and presently I am undectable. I has been 4 years. ",5
"I am on the 29 week of treatment. I get the Peinterferon alfa-2b shots every week along with Ribovarin (twice a day). On my 12 week they made the test again and the virus had diminished. So I am really thrilled with this treatment.  However I've been having really bad side effects, the last problem are my joints, especially in my hands. I started to take MSM to generate glucosamine, and it worked for a while but the pain in my hands and other parts of my body (legs and neck) has returned.  I did get the usual side effects at the beginning, like headaches (terrible), and fever, especially the next day I received the shot. But that ended by the 3rd week.",5

"I was not always thrilled (But who would be). However of the three times I was treated for Hepatitis C, I found this last time using the Pegasys, and Rebatrol, was the easiest. ",5
well i just started treatment 22 days ago but so far no bad side effects been sleeping a little extra but been working overtime at work with no problem. One day had a bad headache but not even sure if it was the treatment or not. I'll let you know how i am doing after my first month and comparing viral loads with blood test b4 i started.,3
"I am only on my 3rd week of treatment. Pegintron and Ribavirin. 1st week was the hardest with severe headache, body aches and vomiting. 2nd week was better just very fatigued. 3rd week just a little fatigued. I drink about 5 16oz glasses of water everyday and I think that this is the key to surviving this treatment. I also do a 10 mile walk ance a week and a 2 mile walk twice a week. So far so good! I am a genotype 3 and my Doctor says it will be easy to get rid of it with this treatment. I pray she is right! GOOD LUCK TO ALL.........",2
"sick, depressed,lost hair and motivation",2
i have finished my treatment! the first month was the worst.not being able to sleep and tired all the time and depression. but with meds. to help me sleep and depression it got better.,4
I am doing my 4th month of 6 treatment for C. Worst trouble functioning is the dizziness. Fatique all the time doesn't allow me to do much. Thank God I don't have to work! Best of luck.,3
"I was on this medication for 6 months.  The side-effects were so severe that I had to be hospitalized twice.  I visited the ER numerous times as well.    I've been left with permanent neurological damage from the drug with severe headaches, mental confusion, tremors and extreme sensitivity to light.  It also failed to work at all.  I would think long & hard before taking this medication.  It left me in a worse condition than I was before.",1
it made me very ill. it only lasted 3 mos. before it depleted my white and red blood cells to a dangerous level. I had to take weekly injections to get normal.1 year later I am much better- but scared,1
"Im on week 38 out of a 48 week treatment. This is my secong go around with this treatment after relapsing less than 6 weeks after my first treatment. The first time I had  NO side affects what so ever and now? besides the headaches, hair loss, memory loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability, depression and trying to keep up with a 16 month old, everything is GREAT. Can't wait to be done, and I also won't do it a third time since I felt normal before starting treatment...",4
"Was on it or 12 months,,lost some hair,,never lost any weight,and was tired and sick usually just the next day after injection. was disease free for about 4 months after treatment then it came back,,wont do treatment again ill something good comes out.Feel great with the disease,so why do treatment,",2
"My husband used peg-intron alfa b. I don't know for sure if this is the same drug. He also used rebetron with it. After six weeks he had to discontinue use. The pamphlet said you may have cloudiness in your sight but that this would go away. However, my husband ended up blind in one eye because the medicine killed all the nerves and has 50/20 sight in the other eye with tunnel vision. We went to a eye specialist and was told it was from toxicity of the medication. Please be careful of any drug you use to help you with hep c. It ended up making his worse.",1
"I have been very lucky with this medication. my side effects have been nothing compared to what so many others report.I get a small headache the day after i inject but tylenol takes care of it. Im tired but I was tired before starting treatment.Thats about it. Im on week 8 of the Ribovirin-Pegasys combo.My viral load became undetectable at week 3.Because Ive had a rapid response I plan to stop treatment at week 12.(I have genotype 2b)The doctors told me that everyone reacts differently to the side effects. I expected to really suffer but I am happy to say thats not the case for me. I drink lots of water, whole milk and juice, no caffeine. I eat one bowl of fortified whole grain cereal before i take the pills twice a day and Ive had no GI symptoms.I try to walk every day for 15 minutes even if im tired and I make time for a nap if I need it.I take the shot on Sat night before I go to bed.Ive lost 12 lbs.I have still been able to work 45+ hrs a week and take care of my family.I dont know if what im doing is making the difference in not being sick or if im just really lucky.Maybe this post will help someone else. ",5
"I am on week 40 of 48 weeks of treatment.  I am undetectable and counting the days until completion.  This has been the hardest thing I've ever had to do but well worth it because it's working.  Side effects include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, irritability, depression, and anemia.  It sucks.",5
"It was a hard time! I went through a 6-month treatment of both drugs combined (interferon and ribavirine) on a weekly basis. People shouldn't fear the immediate side effects since they're predictable in such a health condition - I also thought that I ""was going to die"", especially because the effects went on for 48 hours approx. Regularly I injected the compound in my belly skin on Tuesday evenings, had my share of private hell all Wednesday long and by Thursday morning I was able to stand on my feet, just feeling a little shaky - but the ripping headaches were gone. Personally I have to admit I was getting slightly paranoid - I became extremely aggressive ( in reaction to differing opinions), I became obviously depressed about my life and everything around it (mind you, I was diagnosed just a few weeks before 9/11 and even though I live in Portugal, the global grief caused by the sad event just added to my gloom...). I was lucky that in my job I could use a free day in the middle of the week, otherwise it would have been much harder to carry on. One of the things I try not to go easy on is drinking - I wasn't a alcoholic but, during the 80's, at times, I could become an incredibly talkative pint-swiller ( often going over what could pass for excessive drinking). My Doctors at the Coimbra University Hospitals talked me out of the habit; they said that if I weren't into heavy spirits I could easily stop drinking beer, replacing it with alcohol-free beer, or either drinking a normal one once in a blue moon. I've been doing as they told me, going back to the Hospital for annual ( or bi-annual) check-ups. I stll have some characters left so I'll cut a long story short - in our shoes, one should always remember that you're not alone and that whichever causes your problem might have had, no one chooses HCV deliberately - it'a neither a crime, nor a tragedy. Nurture your inner will and the love and help of others, and it'll mean more than just survival. Cheers everyone!",4
"This drug caused me to be a whiner for a year, it made me feel AWFUL.  Fever, joint pain and fatigue...that said, it saved me... five years out and I am still HCV negative.  Drinking tons of water helped more than anything.  ",5
I have found the side affects of the drugs very difficult to handle. My doctor has lowered the dosage of the interferon which has made a small change.I feel like stopping the treatment. The doctor should have information for self help groups as I feel so alone. My family are wonderful but they don't know how i really feel.Its also the stigma of having this dease. I am a 58 year old woman and how i got this thing i will never know. As well as treating the problem with drugs we also need support which may make the difficult side affect easier to bear.,3
This medication made me think I was going to DIE! Severe flu like symptoms. large hematoma at injection site. I was very thankful for my husband and mother & kids who helped me through this treatment. It is NOT easy. But it does work. I was in treatment for 8 months. And after 4 years I still have normal liver readings from lab test every 6 months. I thank GOD for this medication. Please follow ALL directions given to you by your health care professional. Drink the proper amount of water. and Pray. ,5

"I did the combination therapy with Ribavirin for 3 months before stopping it. i thought i was going to die. went to ER 3 times in a week for abnormal heart rhythms, trouble breathing, and muscle and joint pains.   I test negavtive for HCV after being off for 3 months but i still ahve the muscle pains, weakness, trouble thinking and remembering things, balance and coordination problems, and no energy.  The worst is the depression. I'm 22 years old and am having trouble in school and relationships where I was happy before though living with Hep C. Now i wish i would die.   I strongly urge you to re-think this drug, and if you are on it to make your dr take your complaints seriuosly. Mine just brushed mine off as ""flu-like symptoms"" that would go away. I'm scared they will never.",5
"this is a very bitter-sweet experience!, i had to constantly remind myself why i needed to continue treatment. i felt awfull most of the time and needed mental health care!.i recomend a good coach and diet!.i took the medication for one year and it has been FOUR YEARS!! and there is no hcv in my blood!!. you will hate this drug!, and you will love this drug!, remember to eat well and do not!!!! re-infect yourself!!!!.",5
"Was placed on peginterferon for one year of treatment. The treatment reduced viral load to undetectable by 3 months, and stayed that way for rest of tx.  I relapsed within 6 weeks.  Mixing meds and drawing into syringe was sometimes problematic.  Needles would sometimes be dull.  Side effects were much more severe than second treatment with Pegasus & Copegasus.",3
made me want to die,1
"my genotype helped me, the meds had a lot of side effects, but over six months of treatment it was over.  for what its worth stay on the meds, in the long run its worth its weight in gold!!!",5
"I developed Erythema Nodusum, and possibly Sarcoidosis, & an autoimmune disease if you have a family history of autoimmune diseases BE CAREFUL & TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR - DON'T BE INGORED LIKE I WAS!!! I'm 23 years old, have a beautiful 2 year old daughter, am a Sophomore in college, and some days I cannot even walk, and the pain is so excruciating all I can do is cry.",5
"My doctor overdosed me for nearly two months by giving me 3x the amount for my body weight until I discovered his grave error. When I brought it to his attention he fudged my medical records.  Be sure to check your medicine before taking. The side-effects were so severe- I thought I was going to die.  It has been over two years since I finished the six month treatment.  It left me with RLS- restless leg syndrome, pain in my lower extremities in the joints and muscles, and depression.  ",4
"My cousin has multiple myeloma, her doctor prescribed for Pomalyst. However, this was expensive so we bought generic pomalidomide from medixocentre.com which was my pocket friendly. She completed first cycle of 21 days with minor side effects like headache, itching. She's feeling good than before. We hope for the best in future. I'll add follow up after 2nd cycle.",4
Works well and  side affects are minimal.,5
"Took this for my second outbreak of multiple myeloma and although it did bring my light chains down, I still developed plasma cytoma in my left arm and had to have radiation. I have now had my 2nd stem cell transplant and the dr wanted to use this drug for maintenance chemo. After one month, my light chains are above normal and after the 2nd month they are up 16% more. Looking to try something else next month.",3
"I was started on a 4 mg dose of Pomalyst about a year ago and was having problems, so the dose was dropped to milligrams. I still experienced all of the side effects listed for Pomalyst. This week, we reduced the Decadron dosage from 40 mg weekly to 20 mg weekly. The problem I was having with Decadron was that it either kept me awake for 40 hours during which I felt like I could paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling with one hand tied behind my back, or it put me to sleep for that period of time. I never knew which would happen. As far as effectiveness, the main test my oncologist relies on is the M-protein (SPEP); my numbers have remained fairly constant for a year at 0.3 or 0.4. My oncologist once the number to get to 0.0 before he considers me to be in remission.",4
I now have a blood clot in my right lung. I have been on the drug for over a year. ,3

Taking it for lower back pain with sciatica.  Used it a few years ago and it worked then. Side effects are anxiousness and trouble sleeping.  My doctor prescribed a few Ambien to take care of the insomnia.  It works well for me and is worth the side effects. ,4
"I have been taking prednisone now for 6 months for facial swelling now diagnosed as Melikinsson Rosenthal syndrome,I have racing heart, palpitations, my headaches have increased, constant craving for sugar, muscle wasting, and now mood swings. I started on 10ml and increased to 40ml and am now down to 15ml which will have to go back up because the condition worsened at the lower dose. At the moment there is no other treatment available so with all the side effects they are my only hope.",3
"Gout causes me problems from time to time. It is located in my right foot. Prednisone heals within 24 hours. I take 2 pills every 24 hours. I have found that prednisone works very well for other bodily problems, such as very sore ligament and muscle aches. The price I pay is very cheap!",5
"Diagnosed with PMR, an arthritic immune condition involving aching muscles. This can last 3 to 5 years and then abate on its own. My doctor prescribed 20MG a day with a planned tapering eventually to 3MG. In just one day, I felt like I'd been to a faith healer. All pain and fatigue gone! A wonder drug indeed. After about 18 months, I've tapered off to 2MG per day and feel fine. Currently trying some heavy duty curcumin-based over-the-counter capsules in tandem with the low dose of Prednisone. Hopefully I will be able to discontinue the steroids when the condition subsides or continue with a low dose of both if needed. ",5
Suffering for 9 years 70% of body with eczema - six dermatologist - my primary doctor prescribed pred- I have my life back. I am sleeping - energetic in morning - not fully but so thankful forget the creams the derm Drs prescribe. They know nothing about eczema - the creams just irritate the skin.  I lost 9 yrs of my life going to derm Dr's.  They are good but not for this,4

"Prednisone is a crappy drug. I was on prednisone for 11 months in 1992. I weighed 150 lbs. when I started. When I stopped, I weighed 240 lbs. I was taking Prednisone to treat lmonary sarcoidosis. Through the course of taking the drug, I became very week, had an acne problem, no libido, and the weight gain. The sarcoidosis has returned, and I am back on Prednisone. I told my pulmonologist no when she suggested taking it again. The doctor and my wife talked me into it. If I am on Prednisone long-term, I would rather die!",4
Have had Polymyalgia Rheumatica bouts periodically since 2007. Prednisone with slow taper has provided welcome relief. Currently on 6mg per day and dropping 1 mg every 2 weeks. Dr announced this is last regimen of Prednisone and changing with next flare up to Methotrexate. Sad to lose proven relief.,5
"This drug was prescribed to me in 10mg and 20mg doses by many different doctors during a continuous period from May 2013 thru January 2014 for a chest cold/bronchitis from breathing something that appeared blackish coming out of a central air vent at my job. In Jan. 2014 I woke up with muscle spasms in lower back and severe pain in both hips and back later in the day. I barely could walk by the next day and for the next three months I had therapy, saw different doctors and lots of tests performed but no one found anything wrong. I went back to work in March and made it for 2 weeks but was limping in both hips when I tried to walk. I finally could not walk without severe pain in hips and was sent home from work Started chiropractor, in and out of ER and finally referred to a neurosurgeon who diagnosed me with Avascular Necrosis.  Both of my hips had fractured and collapsed at the same time. Immediately had total right hip replacement and had to continue with left hip fractured until October 2014 while the rat. Hip heeled. Oct 28th left hip replaced and within 3 days it started dislocating so November 12th a revision surgery was performed. Lost my job of 25 years that I started at 20 years old.

"I have been on this medication for over a year and not only have I gained tons of weight but my eye sight has gotten bad because it gave me cataracts, I have high blood pressure now and I truly believe that my adrenal gland has stopped working because just cutting down on dosages cause my body to go into stress.  This medicine has lower my inflammation but it causes a ton of other problems that are not reversible. ",4
"I wish I could give this medication zero stars, and I am an RN. Prednisone has ruined my life. I was given prednisone for a severe viral lung infection (I have asthma) back in August 2016; I had a 104F fever for a week and lost almost 15 lbs. The doctor (with horrible bedside manner) had pressured me to take Prednisone (60 mg) in the office (CityMD clinic)...even-though I only came in for an I.V., due to severe dehydration. I was started on 60 mg (and was supposed to take 40 mg for the next 5 days). Little did I know that it can cause mania and psychosis (I have a history of depression). By the 2nd day I couldn't sleep (I kept talking, cleaning, and writing poetry) and had a manic episode, due to steroid psychosis (and I don't have a history of bipolar disorder). No one in my family knew what was wrong with me. I am WARNING any of you with a psychiatric history to avoid this medication and oral steroids at all costs. Due to taking Prednisone, I lost a full-year college scholarship (I'm studying laboratory science)... (due to being hospitalized) and my housing. I also lost a ton of hair, and it is super thin now. I had to be hospitalized 3 times in the span of the year due to this med causing  suicidal depression after the manic episode. It is depressing that I lost so much money due to copay medical bills amounting to 5k, and I cannot sue the doctor/outpatient clinic for the lost money and time, and my housing (was asked to move out due to mania/steroid psychosis). I will never take another oral steroid (even if I am on the brink of dying and I'd rather die instead). Taking prednisone has resulted in so much embarrassment and humiliation for myself. I have no idea what's worse...the 104F fever and coughing, or taking this medication. Take this medication at your own risk. DON'T LET ANY DOCTOR/FACILITY PRESSURE YOU INTO TAKING PREDNISONE OR STEROIDS.",1
"First of all if you don't need to take this drug, please do yourself a favor and don't start the dose. I wish I read reviews before starting the dose, as I look back Antibiotics should have been sufficient for my symptoms. The problem came when I completed my dose and the withdrawal symptoms kicked in. I started shaking, couldn't see clearly, my heart started beating fast, very anxious, couldn't sleep, fell like I was literally losing it! Almost ended up in the ER, but following other reviews decided to find ways to relax and not think about what was happening: yoga, meditation, playing sleep music and that's how I managed it. My advice for you: stay away from this drug and if you're trying to get off it, do your best to relax.",2
After first dose 50 mg for 1 week I do get a mild headache and blood pressure rises. It has helped used in Jan.2017.

He bruises easily and skin bumps up and his Memory is very bad.  He remember far back things but not thing might have happen yesterday.  So it messes with him short term memory.

"I went to the ER because my powder inhaler was not working in ER the Triage doctor ordered me a steroid shot and 4 vials of liquid albuterol in 1 hr, which I questioned if my doctor was aware of because my usual liquid albuterol amount is 1 vial every 4 hrs, after the shot and the 1 hr of liquid albuterol I was feeling fit as a fiddle but the Triage doctor barely looked over my allergy sheet of all the meds that I am allergic to and she wrote me a script for Prednisone 20 mg tablets to take 3 times a day. I have heart issues, bad valves in my hearttake heart meds with nitro, I have HBP and take 2 different meds for it, I have Crohns disease but regulate it thru diet because the meds are too harsh on my body, I have sinusitis year round and take a daily allergy pill and I have acid reflux and take Nexium for that along with Xanax for anxiety and panic attacks- since having been diagnosed with crohns disease it doesn't take as much of any one kind of medicine as a normal person and my immune system is compromised as well. I am disabled and volunteer at a local preK school where colds, coughing and the flu is non-stop I told the ER doctor this and she still gave me this drug, I started taking the pills on 12/06/16 - 3 daily,immediately I was ill, sick to my stomache, no vomiting just nausea the pharmacist said take it with food I told him I did, He advised then to take it with milk instead, so I did. day 2 I could only get 2 tablets done- I could no longer drink water because it ran out of me I had no bladder control at all and I was nausea's always I called my doctor he said don't take anymore. So I haven't.Its now 12/20/16 - 2 weeks later and I still can't eat- I feel nausea and the only thing I can eat is jello, and drink gaterade.

"WARNING!! CORTISONE CAN BE BAD FOR YOU!! In a review of Lyrica I mentioned Cortisone also. I was only prescribed prednisone when I had a virus or infection that I could not beat. I did not take it continuously. However continued use of CORTISONE IN ANY FORM but especially prednisone (oral) or injections of cortisone with or without botox, cause huge weight gain AND can even cause CUSHINGS SYNDROME (a disease that can be very serious) or effect your thyroid or adrenal glands. Even if it does not have that effect, over time it will cause weight gain and other symptoms. If you have been taking these medicines and have any of the symptoms of Hypothyroid or Cushings tell your Doctor now.  This gets worse, not better. No doctor or ad for the drug or even the pamphlet with the prescriptions warned of this. I have fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, auto immune disease where my body attacks its immune response. hashimotos thyroiditis, cervical dystonia, specific dystonias and chronic migraines. NOW I have CUSHINGS DISEASE due to CORTISONE. These two medications have been used when I become very sick, or have intense pain. Over the course of two years I gained 100 lbs. I was 110 and went up to 210. This is even on a 1200 calorie diet with limited exercise (due to pain). My Endocrinologist has said ""DON'T EVER TAKE CORTISONE IN ANY FORM AGAIN."" He includes oral, injected, nasal and even the cream you use for rashes. Please do not use this drug unless it is to save your life.",3

"Heavy unproductive cough due to cold and viral pharyngitis.  I was prescribed this because the cheratussin alone was not giving much relief for the evening or middle of the night cough.  It has given me some additional relief.  I have had some sweating problems due to Lexapro and for the first time I actually sweat enough in bed to make my pillow wet.  Sweating is a possible side effect of predisone.  I'm willing to deal with it for the cough relief, but I hope I can manage the sweating with a change of medications after the cold is gone.",4

I was then given prednisone and inflammatory markers declined. However, I have been trying to get off prednisone for over a year and now have chronic relapsing pericarditis.  I am taking high doses of another immune suppressing drug and still cannot get down below 12.5 mg prednisone per day. Corticosteroid use is clearly associated with relapsing pericarditis, so do not go on this drug if you have acute pericarditis.

"I was prescribed 400mg daily to treat a brain tumor (chronic inflammation) on my pituitary gland. I ended up taking 5900mg in 28 days. I feel like this drug is a catch 22. The medication did its job by getting rid of the tumor, but the side effects were terrible. I gained at least 60 pounds while taking it, accompanied by night sweats, hot flashes, and insomnia. When I was being weaned off the Prednisone, I experienced the worst muscle cramps and joint pain I've ever had in my life. The steroids ended up cutting off the blood supply to the ends of my bones in my knees and elbows causing me to have to undergo months of physical therapy on them. So, like I said, catch 22. The effectiveness of this drug is outstanding. It completely removed all traces of my brain tumor. The side effects, however, are a pain to deal with, literally.",5

From the first day, the sharpness of the pain diminished quickly.  It's been 6 years since the accident and this is the first time I could actually sleep longer than 3 hours.  Before, I would hurt so badly especially my right hip/pelvic I wanted to just gnaw my leg off, it was that bad!

"I was prescribed this medication because the inflammation in my body was unbearable and the initial belief that I had rheumatoid arthritis tested negative several times, followed by testing for a myriad of other disorders and diseases.  My doctors (I have been to 3) were stumped and suggested a rheumatologist, but there were none in the area I was from.  I was a complete living dead girl and in so much pain that all I wanted to do was sleep or stay in bed and was bedbound for over a year. This pill changed my life! I lost 124 pounds and went back to college. The only thing is every one of them told me that prednisone is not something you should stay on for very long periods of time and I have been on it for 2 years now.  I felt a few side effects around the year and a half mark like I stopped menstruating completely.  I wasn't too worried about it and they didn't seem to be either. Now, however, I have major weakness, constant depression, frequent random crying, major migraines, and the pain in my body is starting to become unbearable again. This drug made me feel human for the first time in my life, so the idea of stopping it genuinely scares me. All I can think is if it is this bad now while I am still on the pill then how bad will it be if they take me off of it.  I am starting to worry that whatever my condition is, it is starting to outrun the prednisone. I know that my body is obviously addicted to it at this point, and they did try lowering it which sent me right back to being corpse-like so it was raised again.  I loved how the pill worked for me, but obviously prolonged usage is not a good thing. I have my first rheumatology appointment next week and honestly my nerves are shot!",5
Prescribed this drug by doc for severe allergic reaction due to unknown cause probable reaction to antibiotic.Total body itching so bad could not sleep.Absolutely Amazing results. Within two days all symptoms totally cleared.   A REAL PLUS was pain in knees for months amazingly removed as well. One knee replacement painful. Other knee just arthritic pain. Both are amazingly better. This drug has given me new life!  ,5
"works great right away ,But side affects are no so easy 1 month jumping out of my skin getting better but DOES IT GO AWAY MORE PLEASE INPUT ",5
Taking a Medrol dose pack for sinusitis and bronchitis. I have been miserable all week until I started this today and the pressure relief is unbelievable. I am so thankful for this medication,5
"I have the best skin at times and the worst, allergies can easily turn me into a monster.  Prednisone is the only medication that brings me back to reality and heals the most miserable skin effects possible.  But, you have to follow a serious diet or you will turn into a blimp and swell beyond to an imaginable size with a matter of 2weeks.  First, read instructions, do your research! No fried foods No soy  No salt, gluten, peanuts or corn! No sugar ( very little) No Cake, bread, cupcakes, rice, potatoes, pasta, (you get were Im going with this). Its vert important to avoid white foods! .MOST OF ALL No diary, try subs like almond milk, egg substitutes, diary free ice cream if you want a treat but after you have stopped using the Prednisone.  Try to follow a vegetarian meal plan schedule for the first week and if possible the entire duration if you want the best results.  ( You can cheat on the weekends or just do 3days a week of meat, very small portions, no fat!)  Drink lots of WATER....all day to protect your KIDNEYS! Drink smoothies with raw veggies and fruit to get the Antioxidants working you your behalf to clear the TOXINS while the body is trying to heal!  I had to learn the things that break me out but you can never fully protect yourself and when its bad its bad and you need a jumpstart back to healthy, non itchy skin!  I've been on this road for a long time and just started receiving prednisone treatments and went through a lot of trial and error but when I followed the treatment plan and diet, I lost 25 pounds instead of gaining weight.  Oh and definitely exercise while consuming, even if you just do 80 jumping jacks in the evening or walk briskly for 15 mins a day!  Good luck, and I hope this helps people struggling with have to take this medicine.",5
"I was very happy with this drug, but after multiple courses it has become useless against my eczema. ",4
Phemphigus (a rare autoimmune  condition) is decreased very slowly by use of prednisone.,4
"Seriously dangerous drug that unfortunately is a lifesaver for many conditions.  Those of you that  have a brief spell of Bronchitis and take it - no worries.  Those of us that have been on it for many years - the disfiguring side effects are horrible. ""Moon face""  hump in the back, enormous weight gain even if you're not eating more, intense hunger.   I had 8 hospitalizations for acute respiratory failure last year.  On prednisone dose as high as the pill equivalent of 120 mg - sometimes for a couple of weeks.  Eventually they'd let me go back to my normal dose of 10 mg.  I gained 70 pounds in that year.  I, however, would likely be dead if I hadn't taken it and it kept me off the ventilator (started bipap)    But I once was a beautiful, healthy looking woman - I now am embarrassed to look in a mirror.  Working on the weight loss but I have COPD so severly next year may be as bad as this - I am trying practice better habits and try to stay out of the hospital.   Then think about weaning off the 10 mg.   ",5
Was like a miracle drug. My pain was gone after second dose of it. Only on 15 mg a day.  I have renewed energy.,5
"Once or twice a year I use this drug in a ""Z"" pack to partake in sporting events. My energy level is off the charts and the inflammation in my knees is virtually nil (I've had numerous knee and ACL surgeries). This product is like the fountain of youth for me...My girlfriend however says I become a tad aggressive.  ",5
"I have been on Prednisone for 6 month's now to help ease joint pain from RA and other undiagnosed pain.I started out at 20 mg daily and it help ease the pain pretty well, I mean the pain is still there but now it's like it's in the background. my doctor has tapered me down to &.5 it's not helping as well but it's still better then nothing.But because of weight gain and moon face I asked to try something else I was put on Sulindac and it didn't help at all then they tried Diclofenac and age nothing but pain so I am back on the Prednisone. It doesn't hype me up,give me mood swings,or make my hair fall out, it just makes me fat and I don't understand how because I have no appetite I have to force myself to eat at least a little something once a day, but somehow I keep gaining weight?I plan to keep trying other meds to help ease my pain. One thing that really worried me about Prednisone it that it lowers your immune system  and I already have low immune issues, if I get the flu I am in the hospital near death (no joke) SO because of that I rarely leave my house when I do I wear a mask, I don't kiss my grand kids because they always have a little cold or something and even though I love them dearly my health to too touch to risk any contact the germs. If anyone knows something that works well for RA an nero pain contact me @ [email protected] thanks ",3
"This was prescribed for prolonged episodes of severe ulcerative colitis lasting 4 weeks and 6 weeks respectively one year apart. 8 tablets once a day for 5 days, both times there was marked improvement after 12 hours,almost asymptomatic after 24 hours and felt completely well again after 2-3 days.  No discernible side effects.",5
"A  Lifesaver  that works 100% For my Breakthrough Pain'  Gout Siactia  various  other Spinal issues, one Pain med as well. NEVER Take  more than  the RX  says. &  Remember to taper down when the flareups subside. Been on it and mostly off,  for over 4 years. No severe adverse reactions thus far have occurred. ",5
I had Prostate cancer my doctor prescribed prednisone pills and  docetaxel injection and the prednisone works very well for my prostate cancer,5
"I was given this medication for a severe case of poison ivy. I admit I didn't want to take it but did because the rash and itching were driving me crazy. When taken previously, it made my heart race and it gave me the shakes. This time the Dr. advised taking the full dose in the morning with a good breakfast. The dosage was 60 mg decreasing every four days by 20 mg. I had a slight headache by late morning the first two days but then by day three, I felt better than I have in years! When I got to day ten (20 mg at that point), the poison ivy rash was cleared but the severe joint pain that I've had for years was coming back. When treatment was completed, the symptoms I've had for years (severe joint pain, headaches, lethargy, difficulty concentrating etc.) were back and I am miserable again. I have been asking my Dr. for years if I could possibly have Lupus or Rheumatoid Disease and have been told ""no"".  But after taking the Prednisone with such a MAJOR improvement, I think that my poison ivy may have actually helped diagnose a much more serious problem. I think I may have to try another Dr. who is willing to listen to me as well. I should mention that the Dr. who prescribed the Prednisone was not my regular Dr. but was from a local hospital clinic that I went to after work.",5

blood sugar of 112  ended up in the ER with a count of 490  one of the most dangerous drugs I have ever taken -was with doctors last 3 days  weaning me off it ,1
I am hypothyroid so I felt better than usual on this med.  The tendon in my thumb was inflamed and 3 days of 50mg helped considerably.   ,4
I have had a lot of problems sleeping and I wake up the bed and all of my clothes are soaking wet.  I sweat all day long to the point where I get weak and am miserable.,3
This medication side effects are the same as the main problem and the reason you are taking this medication  even telling the Dr still want me to continue this meds FDA  I think you really need to review this side effects and really consider better evaluations not just to get the money from Drug companies to approved their garbage that are harming people instead of helping they are quiet a few  drugs need to be out of the market as well energy drinks ,1
"This drug was my life savor growing up. I had severe asthma and this seemed to be the only medicine to control it. I have been on it 2-3 times a year since I was 6 years old (20 years now). The only warning I can give is be careful of long-term use. Because of this medication and how often I had to have it, my dose had to be increased over the years and because of all that, my growth was stunted. ",5
This medication was given to me to treat a severe sinus infection and it gave me SEVERE leg pain. Beware!,1
"Every morning from 6am to 6:30am I had a brief reprieve, at 6:30am I took an 8 times the normal dose everyday for 6 weeks. I can't describe how terrible this was, after 2 weeks I began sleeping on my bathroom floor, the nausea was incredible, messy and bloody. It worked, it reminded me of a description I once read from a failed suicide that drank Drano. ",3
"After 5 days, I am having higher blood pressure readings and a headache with thick feeling in head.  Also shakiness in extremities. I will go from 6 to 4 pills tomorrow.  Sinus is better though.",5
"I started out for 7 days, 40 mg down to 10 mg. It didn't work and felt like crap. Symptoms returned Dr. put me on 80 mg for 2 days, 60 mg for 6 days, 40 mg for 4 days, etc. 15 days later I was off them. The most EVIL drug on the market. Couldn't sleep or eat. Horrible stomach pain and just a nasty person! Hand and arms shakes were the worst. Been off the drug for 3 weeks and the symptoms have returned. Dr. wants to do another course of the drug. Not gonna happen!The side effects were rotten, the withdrawal effects were the worst...still can't sleep. ",2
"How long do the side effects stay in your system after finished taking?  Major nervousness, sleeplessness, depression, tired, headaches.  After being off of them several days still feeling some of these symptoms.  ",4
I was given this along with a z-pak for bronchitis in both lungs by a redi care place... It made SWEAT so much I could ring my clothes out.  I have never sweat that bad in my life... I HATE HATE HATE it and will ask for something different next time.  I even called my family Dr and they don't even know why it's making me sweat... claimed that's not a side effect?!?!  So instead of taking two like it says I'm opting for one... to see if maybe I can make it through a night without having to change the sheets on my bed because I sweat so bad they are soaking wet.,3
"Definitely noticed an immediate reduction in chronic wheezing brought on by a bout of bronchitis-induced asthma. Side effects have included a puffy, bloated feeling overall and immediate weight gain of about 8 lbs over a few days (most likely fluid retention). There is a strange stimulant effect that isn't like caffeine but more like endorphins after exercise. I have had some headaches at night opposite the schedule I've been taking these on.",4
"I had a really bad allergic reaction to Bactrim that caused severe itching and rash all over my entire body.  After not sleeping for 2 days, and seeing two separate doctors, I went to the ER and told them to make it stop!  They prescribed me prednisone.  Within 1 hour of taking the first dose, the itching was gone and I could sleep!  It's a miracle!  The only thing that's really annoying is the strange dosing schedule (3x/day 1-3, 2x/day 4-6, 1x/day 7-9, 1/2 /day until gone).  My memory isn't the best so the dosing schedule conerns me a little (I don't want to mess it up).  Other than that, the drug itself is amazing!",5
"shaking,over heating,gained 65lb,somewhat pain relieved,poor sleep",4
"Prescribed this for sciatica/herniated disk pain before surgery since I couldn't take my other anti-inflammatory. I dislike how many pills I'm taking, but I have noticed a decrease in pain. I'm anxious, but that could be due to the upcoming surgery and I already take an anti-anxiety. Other than that, the only side-effect I've noticed (so far) was sweating the first few days. ",4
I had HSP that caused a secondary IgA nephropathy in June 2012.  Had kidney failure and on dialysis till July 2014.  Received kidney transplant and had the IgA aggressively attacking my new kidney.  I have been on prednisone for entire time.  Had to take high dose 60mg for first 6 months and then tapered down.  I was placed on high dose 100mg for three months during period after transplant.  I absolutely hate what it has done to me.  I have many problem as result.  Had cateract surgey on both eyes.  Have put on lot of weight.  Cushing syndrome.  Have barretts esophagus as result of drugs.  I felt horrible when on high dose.  I know it was required to cut down on inflammation of kidney but not a pleasant drug at all.  Currently down to 10mg.  Feel genuinely sorry for everyone who has to take high dose of this drug.    ,5
"Given a 2-week flight of Prednisone for poison ivy.  Works like a charm!  Side effects for me?  Increased appetite, raging bad breath, and it's making me stink over all!  It's a good thing it works, but can't wait to be off of it!",5
"quite bitter, leaving a taste in the throat. Since taking this, I have had increased flatulence and trouble sleeping. ",3
"I was given this med in conjunction with a 5 day course of antibiotics for pleurisy. The same dose for the 5 days. The day after the last dose of prednisone I experienced flashing lights in my vision along with blurred vision. My head began feeling fuzzy, and generally wasn't feeling all that great. The next morning a whole slew of new symptoms...lightheadedness, dizziness (vertigo sensation), heaviness behind my eyes, headache, overall weakness and shakiness, no appetite, nausea, continued blurred vision, difficulty speaking (I could think somewhat clearly, but could not spit the words out). Hence a trip to the ER. Bloodwork, CT scan and examination saw nothing. I was discharged with instructions for dizziness and prescription for antivert. The next morning it felt like all the muscles in my body were spasming, tingling and weak. I could barely lift my arms to shampoo my hair in the shower. The sides of my face where the jaw joint is was even spasming or something! My neck felt swollen like when you have swollen glands, but didn't look it. Some of my previous symptoms were still hanging around too. Another trip to the ER, and they diagnose me with malaise! Both times I tried to say that this MUST be a reaction to or withdrawal from the prednisone! All they could say was 'possibly'. All these side effects coincide exactly with this medication's side effects! It was horrible. I'm on day 5 after my last dose. So far feeling a bit better. I will only take this again if my life is in danger. I think the antibiotics would have done the job, or at least would have liked to have given it a shot. The doctor nor the pharmacist mentioned any of these side effects. You only know by reading the warnings that usually come with your prescription. I was not given a tapered dose, and perhaps I was just hyper-sensitive. But I thought something was seriously wrong or that I was having a stroke!  ",3
"I take this for Asthma, it works wonders.",5
I used this for a breakout of hives all over my body following the birth of my son.  It was 3 days before I got any relief from the hives and longer before they were all eradicated. I'm not 100% sure this medication fixed it or if they would have been relieved on their own.   ,3
I have been taking this for soon 1 year for PMR I have every known side effect from it,3
"The worst medication I have ever taken. I took this for 6 months straight after being diagnosed with systemic lupus. I gained 60+ pounds instantly, my entire hormonal system got messed up, and I got insane water retention and moonface. Horrible! I also felt shaky and like I was going crazy. ",2
"Suffer from chronic asthma, also very bad sinus . After taking prednisolone , it helped me to breath and also got my smell and taste back.",5
"Tonsillitis,chest congestion, sinus infection,after taking the this medicine all symptoms improved within the second day,no side effects at all so far,very please with the doctors prescription. I plan to use this med again in the future if needed. ",5
"Severe allergies causing laryngitis and a sinus infection was the reason for beginning prednisone. Much to my surprise, I didn't experience jitters or sleeplessness or swelling.  Positive side effects: my back and knee pain are gone!  And I have lost a little weight, possibly because all the pain was gone.  I feel like I can do anything!  Yesterday was my last dose so I am now waiting to see how long the effects will last.   ",5
"For a serious poison ivy rash covering 30% of my left forearm, I was prescribed a 9 day 60/40/20mg regimen of prednisone. The effects of the drug were almost immediate (itching relief, and rash spread arrested after first dose,).  After 1 week, the rash was gone.  I had used this medication 15 years prior, with similar results, and no side effects, in fact it made me feel like  Superman.  BUT NOT THIS TIME!  During, and following my recent 9 day regimen, I experienced many of the known physical, and mental side effects of this drug, including; insomnia, increased appetite, stomach discomfort, constipation, severe headaches, irritability, anger, and depression.  I have been off the drug for 7 days, and am experiencing lingering depression, for which I will be seeking treatment.  It has not been fun.  I strongly recommend discussing with your doctor, the minimum dosage, and duration required for your condition.",5
"Last week my doctor prescribed Prednisone for my sinus/ears inflammation.  I take 2 each morning, have 3 more days.  So far it hasn't kicked in that much but our pollen count is high right now.  For those of you taking this for arthritis, look up Turmeric reviews & maybe give it a try.  ",3
I was in constant pain when moving around. since starting this drug I am able to do normal activities without pain and the effects are felt almost immediately.,5
On this med for 4 months due to developing radiation pneumonitis from radiation treatments for breast cancer. Fluid retention during the treatment is so bad and painful. I have gained 25 lbs in 4 months. Dr now has me on 2 fluid meds to help.  Leg cramps from the prednisone or extra weight wake me up at night,4
"I have taken this many many times over the last 25 years, in the beginning every day. The first couple of days I get a horrendous headache. My blood sugar reading are all over the place, mainly very high then a quick drop.Also my body aches like the flu the first couple of days.I am very jittery and am always hot, especially my feet.When I was on it daily my hair began to thin, the skin on my hands was thin and would split open easily but my veins/arteries became ""tough"" making starting an IV difficult. BUT with all of these side effects it has saved my life, I don't think I  would be here without the use of prednisone. Bonus, it makes my arthritis almost disappear! ",5
Relief of pain from inflammation of arthritis,5
"I am taking this for Bell's Palsy (first occurrence) for 4 days now.  I have not had any adverse side effects, however, I have not seen any improvement either.  Have 6 more days left of lower dosage and I will see if there is any recovery.  I am researching B-Vitamins for after my Prednisone is complete.  I have heard that it works for some people.  If you know someone with Bell's, please be sympathetic and patient.  What you don't hear a lot from doctors and websites is that there is significant pain in the face and can be severe fatigue... not to mention the extra trauma of one's face being paralyzed.  I am hoping to recover, but since this is not getting better, I have no idea.",3
"I have been taking this prednisone for less than 24 hours. I have severe leg pain which feels like its in my bones. I don't know what is worse, having coughing fits throughout the day and night and having pains from that or these leg pains. I have taken tylenol and ibprophen and nothing seems to help. I have also done some research and it seems the pain may not go away for some time even after I am finished taking them. I am very worried and will be calling the doctor tomorrow morning first thing!",4
"It is doing what it's supposed to do, but the side effects are bad. I can't sleep, have extreme mood swings twice a day, and have gained weight. Started with 8 5mg per day for 2 weeks, then 7, 6, 5, 4, ect..",5
"Currently taking about a week's worth doseage that decreases every two days. I was prescribed the drug to help reduce the swelling of my throat due to mono. After taking the first dosage, I could swallow and eat solid food within the hour. It had been five days since I could eat without crying.  So far, I haven't had any real bad side effects. ",5
"I've taken my 4th out of 5 pills that were prescribed to me because I've been having dry/itchy/red skin (doctors say it 'could' be eczema), and so far no noticeable side effects. It has stopped the itching but we'll see in a few weeks if my skin clears up.",3
"1st time user, wonderful... took 3 as prescribed, horrible lung pain largely  subsided within 4 hrs, feel confident to face tomorrow. Thank you, Lord God.",5
"Although this drug cleared up the rash I was taking it for, the side effects were not pleasant to say the least. This drug made me hyper like I was on speed or something like it. Had a hard time sleeping, gained 3 lbs in the week I used it and my blood glucose increased by 20 pts, made me very sensitive and emotional; edgy. I wound not recommend using this long term.",4
"This is a wonder drug. All good things will come with some side effects.Yes,the side effects suck. You decide,whats worse,the side effects or the condition you are taking it for. Its that simple",5
"I have had vasculitis (wegener's) for over 10 years.  I was on very high doses to very low doses of prednisone for tens years straight.  Sure, it helps bring down the severe inflammation, and it does help keep you alive when you are in dire straights, but there has to be an alternative once the bad mess is calming down.  Here's what can and often does happen on pred long term...not a taper:  Major weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, mood swings, severe depression, insomnia, suppressed immune system, anger, edema, moon face, acne, hump on your back...I'm not kidding.  I had each of those symptoms and many at the same times.  If you are going to be on high doses then you make sure you and your doctor agree that you don't want to stay on it more than a few months after your illness has quieted down. ",4
DR prescribed for my asthma. Asthma is better also while using it the arthritis pain in my knee was much better. Now I can breathe better and walk better making it a lot easier to get around.,5

I'm taking 60 mg once daily for seven days to combat an allergic reaction I had to the shingles vaccine. Currently at day three and my severe rash has stopped spreading and actually seems to be beginning to fade. I've had a slight headache which I suppose is coming from the prednisone as I rarely ever have headaches. In addition to the prednisone I'm was prescribed Atarax 25 mg every six hours for the itching and once daily for seven days I take one each Zyrtec and Zantac 75 (both OTC). ,5
"Taking Predisone for Graft vs Host disease (in the gut) after Bone marrow transplant for Aplastic Anemia. Started at about 40mg and we're trying to slowly taper it off so the graft can get used to the host... My response to his drug was immediate. I was losing weight quickly from GVHD due to lack of appetite and nausea, then when I was put on prednisone my appetite immediately improved. My face became round and other parts of me are puffier than normal, e.g. shoulders, arms, neck, and seems to be growing more hair. This drug makes it hard to sleep. I take 2xBenedryl to go to sleep every night and it really works. Melatonin never worked for me in the first place, so depends on what you react to better. I've been on it for about 6 months now. Can't wait to be rid of it!",4
"I have never felt so much like a zombie. I am taking this for arthritis in my back. It has kept me out of work for 3 weeks. I am hungry and tired, but can't sleep. It eased the pain for awhile, but not completely. I am going to try and never take again.",3
"Have been prescribe Prednisone for various reasons (RA & Bronchitis primarily).  Am ok on ""lower"" doses (less that 30 Mg a day) above that I get ""fuzzy tounge"" and mouth irritation. also messes with my stomach at higher doses (Nausea, heartburn).  Currently on .5Mg daily to boost my immune system during the winter. ",4
I've only been taking this for 2 days and have the worst headache I have ever had. Nothing helps the pain. I'm taking it for a persistent sinus and ear infection. I think the pain from the ear infection and sinus infection is better than this headache. ,2
no problems,5
"it gave me all listed side effects starting from low calcium in body, cataract, high BP, high cholesterol, among other minor problems it can. Hope and wish no one has to take this. i have been taking for more than 9 years now",3
i'm taking this medication at this current moment and it is the absolute worst!!! I have the worst heartburn I think I have ever felt.,1
"I took Prednisone for treatment of Lichen Planus.  This was a 21-day therapy from heck!  You start out at 70mg daily for three days then every three days you drop down 10mg.  I was so jittery, emotional, very hot one minute and cold the next, severe migraines toward the end of treatment, vision changes and my heart was pounding at times.  I didn't see all that much improvement in my treatment that I had to stop 4 days early because the headaches were just getting worse.  I don't think I will ever take this medication again.",3
Took 50mg (1 a day) for 5 days to relieve severe swelling & pain on big toe joint/foot. I got near total relief in less than two days with no noticeable side effects. Worked well for me.  ,5

"I took this drug given to me by the ER doctor for sciatica nerve pain in my back and leg it has been 5 days I feel less pain has helped, but medication has made me anxious and not sleepy. I guess all drugs give you some satisfaction with some side affect. I started doing yoga and this has made me feel even better for my pain. Today was my last day of treatment.",4
"I was dx with MS 15 years ago. I was using prednisone every few years when I had a relapse (40-60mg/day then taper)--it really helped.  I had terrible fatigue, achiness, irritability, hot flashes with perimenopause-these sxs are better with HRT. But felt an immense improvement with prednisone. Now am using prednisone more regularly and it helps with fatigue, energy, well being.  I would have to say that prednisone has really been helpful for me over the years with minimal negative side effects.",5
it is the only medication that helps me breathe!! It is wonderful even with the side effects.  i have quality of life back and I am willing to risk the long term effects so I can breathe,5
I have had asthma for years and successfully treated it with brief prednisone treatments.  My asthma became uncontrolled about 4 years ago. About 1 year ago I was diagnosed with ABPA and started treatment with an antifungal and prednisone.  I am slowly phasing off the prednisone and have not had a significant flare up of asthma since beginning this combination treatment 11 months ago. (The ABPA was apparently triggering my asthma.),4
This drug has helped my condition immensely but I don't care for the side effects of feeling like I'm starving and weight gain and puffy face. I've only been on it for just over a month and on a very low dose. I am also bipolar and on a higher dose it caused mania so my doctor lowered my dose by half.,5

On 5 mg the swelling has returned to my feet and hand.  I felt absolutely great on 20 and 15mg.  I was walking 2 miles a days.  I am not certain I can continue walking 2 miles.  I do excercise every other night.  Weight lifting is important to do however, when your hand hurts it is difficult to do. I would hate to have to continue on predisone but I feel it was a wonder drug for me. It was nice to feel like I used to.",5

"I used this as a bridge medicine (I was switching from one big med to another, predisone was the bridge) when I was 13 and gained 70 pounds in the year I was on it. It helped my arthritis, kept me focused in school, and I had high energy. But I honestly wouldn't do it again because now I'm 18, 5 ft 2 in, weighing 180 lbs and now that my arthritis is no longer under control, it's harder to manage with all this extra weight on my joints. Plus I've had multiple stress fractures because the long term prednisone depleted the calcium in my bones. My GI doctor (I also have autoimmune hepatitis) just put me back on this last week because of my elevated liver levels. I wasn't pleased to hear this news due to my previous experience, but so far I've been feeling good and eating SUPER healthy so I don't gain ANY more weight. I hope some of you have a better journey with this medicine. Bottom line: short term=good, long term=bad. ",5

The best advice I can give anyone, is have an open, honest conversation with your doctor if you are experiencing these side effects and see what may help you. If you're on this for a very short time, you may just want to get through it. If you're in it for the long haul, (particularly a high dosage), talk to your doc about managing side effects. ",5

The redness has significantly reduced, the itching is much relieved, the skin on the lesions is smoother, more elastic and less thick.

"Polymyalgia Rheumatica came on very suddenly in December, 2013.  The Rheumatologist started me on 5 mg. of Prednisone and Folic Acid daily (Folic Acid only 6 days a week), and taking 3 Methrotrexate once a week.  Within a month I was up to 7.5 mg. of Prednisone and 6 Methrotrexate.  I am now down to 4 mg. of Prednisone unless the PMR flares up considerably.  I find the Prednisone slow to take effect - 3-4 hours, but it's better than nothing.  If I could have Cortisone injections every other week, that would be great, but that's not an option because of the physical complications it can cause.  Hopefully the PMR will not last too long; expected to last 1-4 years. The low dosage of Prednisone does not appear to affect my sleeping habits unless I take the higher dose.  My doctor wants me off Prednisone ASAP, but plans after that are to continue with the Methrotrexate and Folic Acid.  What a terrible disease this PMR is.  Although ""they"" say the cause is unknown, my Rheumatologist said that most every one of his patients with PMR experienced Rheumatic Fever in their childhood, and the PMR reared its head after some type of trauma (mine being that my spleen ruptured for some unknow reason in my sleep in Nov., 2013).",3

I cant walk my dog. I am using up all my savings to live on because I cant work. I now have such trouble breathing again I'm afraid I will have to start taking it again and will have to start all over. While i was on it my diaphram was punctured by my bowel, (whiich was possibly compromised during the lung biopsy taken to diagnose my pneumonia) resulting in emergency surgery. I have no muscles left to return to any type of work that I am qualified for. The high dose and length of treatment is a big factor for my case.

Side effects for me were APPETITE! And when i say appetite i mean appetite for bad things...sweets, breads, CARBS! It's very hard, but if you can sometimes curb it, it's not too bad. I also noticed i sweat more. Kind of like hot flashes. Sleeping can also be a tad difficult so DO NOT TAKE THESE PILLS TOO LATE! They do give you quite a bit of energy. THESE PILLS ARE ALSO NOT MEANT FOR LONG TERM USE. I think the longer you are on them, the greater the side effects. My Dr started me on 40mg for 10 days has now started weening me 5mg a day every 3 days. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU WEEN YOURSELF OFF THIS MED or the side effects can be drastic! FOLLOW DRS ORDERS! ",5
"I have had night sweats, depression, anxiety, crazy thoughts and feelings, bi polar, rapid heart rate, extremely hyper ness, can't sit still, stomach pain, horrible feeling, can't even function, can't sleep, dizziness, blurry in my eyes, from this medicine and more. I think it affected my life. ",2
it helped me breath better and exercise to lose weight,5
"taking prednisone to replace cortisol. Had a Pituatery tumor. there are a lot of side effects. I have diabetes,type 2. thinning skin; chloresteral and many other side effects",3
MY CHEST WAS TIDE I CAN BRIEFT AND NOW FELL SUPER GOOD WITH THIS PRESCRIPTION ,5
Gain way too much weight. It did not reduce my pain in joints at all,1
"Taking 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night for cancer on the spine,a type of lymphoma.Also I am now having Chemo,which I understand that already has this drug in it.I get this thing my wife and I call the EBBIE GEEBBIE""S,nasty,jitters,skin crawling,cannot sleep,up every 10 minutes trying to walk it off,no luck. I did notice that if I take a few Xanax,this seems to give me at least 4 hours of sleep,this was my idea,not the doc.But if this is to help kill this tumor,I guess I can try to deal with it.Good luck all,This is nasty stuff.",4
"So far prednisone has been the only relief I have gotten from these awful hives. I have tried so many medications and have not gotten any relief. Within 4 hours of taking my first 50 mg pill, the hives were gone. I've been on it for 4 days now and am still hive free, however I became ill while taking Flagyl and could not take the prednisone as I was vomiting - the hives returned in full force. I stopped the flagyl and resumed my prednisone and am again hive free. I only am on this medication for 1 week and am afraid that my hives will return when the week is up. Side effects are manageable - I was on this medication years ago for about 6 months and gained a lot of weight. I am sure this will not happen in so short a time.",5
"I have polycystic kidney disease and a host of airborne and food allergies.  My life has been a continual struggle to push past the pain of fatigue, headaches, stuffy nose, etc.  Almost all of the meds the doctors try to give me make life even more miserable.  So I usually quit taking them when they become unbearable.  But last year I was having a problem with my breathing.  There was severe dry coughing for about six months.  And then I started having problems breathing.  The doctor gave me a prescription for methyl prednisolone which started out at 60 mg a day and decreased daily.  It was great.  After the first day the coughing stopped and the breathing problems were almost gone.  I've never had so much pain relief in my life before.  It did cause me to be awake at night, but I wasn't as sleepy during the day, so I didn't care.  But as soon as I quit taking it, the headaches and allergies were back. So now I take 5 mg a day of Prednisone.  It doesn't make the headaches or the allergies go away completely, but they are not as bad as without the Prednisone.   It helps me have more energy in the day, and I have less leg cramps when I take it.  At 5 mg per day I do NOT see any negative side affects.   ",5
"I was very fortunate to be quickly diagnosed for Temporal Arthritis. Started on 60mg prednisone 2.5 weeks ago. Was in extreme pain with stabbing headaches, jaw pain,sweats, double vision....after the 1st dose my symptoms almost totally disappeared. I do have some side effects from the drug but it is more than bearable. I am taking extra calcium, D, C & potassium as this drug can do bone harm. Having double temporal biopsy this Fri. I pray the results come back positive so we are certain about the disease and hopefully begin decreasing dosage. No matter the side effects I'll have in the future I take them over blindness or stroke. Best to all!",5
"responded to short course ,started on 60 mg/d, platlet count raised up to safe levels in 6 days,tapered dose every third day ... had tachycardia ,facial puffiness,sometimes calf muscle pains and decreased sleep, but these were not troublesome....",4
I have gained weight in abdominal area.  A big problem!,3
"I took this medication and had a bad reaction. I would not suggest it. After I took it, a nurse friend of mine told me that I should never take this again and that she would never take it herself.       I would suggest that if you have any problems that you look at vitamin supplements first.  Our diets do not give us the adequate vitamins that our body needs. After my ordeal, I found a compounding pharmacist who helped my understand vitamins.  I have started eating more vegetables and my body responded by actually feeling better.  If your doctor isn't looking at your nutritional foods you are eating and isn't checking your blood for vitamin deficiencies then you may want to find another doctor because you will continue to have sickness until you address the root cause.",1

"One of the very worst problems with cluster headaches is getting people, even some doctors, to understand exactly how terribly painful these ""attacks"" are.  I have suffered from these for over 25 years (usually last 90 days, no particular time of year, three or four a day and night).  I COMPLETELY understand the ""suicide"" remark.  One does want to blow ones brains out. I have been prescribed everything but due to an unrelated heart disease problem, Zomig is not a good option. The O2 didn't work, I usually ended up taking 20 or so advil (three per attack) per day. FINALLY, after ringing the ""pain"" bell as loudly as I could, my neurologist prescribed this drug.  Almost immediately, the severe headaches went away.  After two weeks, I might get one moderate one a day.  This is a dramatic improvement for me. If you are as desperate as I was to stop these things and your doctor has not tried a steroid plan, INSIST ON THIS!!!! I AM experiencing a 10 pound weight gain two weeks in but I will deal with that. Truly a life saver for me.  If you have cluster headaches, you know EXACTLY what I mean by that.",5

"DO NOT use this is you have any sort of depression problems, mine have gone from manageable to severe on this med. Insane temper flare ups on the verge of crazy in my opinion. I am usually a reasonable and quite calm person. Has done nothing as far as I can tell for my condition and has made my hot flashes return with a vengeance! To any seniors posting here WARNING this drug literally killed my father who was in perfect health at 75. Put on dose after dose which masked an infection he had (Histoplasmosis) by the time doctors discovered what was wrong, his entire body was ravaged by the steroids and the disease.It was a prolonged and torturous death 24 months and if you are over 60 I would say to you find an alternative to constant use of this drug. I am terrified being on it and if there are no positive results I will never take it again! Too many dangers involved here for casual use and prescribing doctors seem far to willing to overuse this med.",3
Has stopped pain ,5
I have never felt better in my life than I did on the 16 days I was on this medication.  My constant Sjogren's pain stopped within a few days on this medication and my fatigue dropped tremendously. My brain fog decreased and my thinking improved.  My energy level became normal.,5
i've had terrible allergic reaction.,3
I was taking for poison oak and it helped. The beneficial side affect was that the arthritis in my knee and the inflammation pain in my ankle (morning only) and shoulder (year old ski accident) have completely gone away within the first week of taking it. Yeah! Poison oak is still hanging around though.,4

I have no refills on it so I'm hoping that my dr will give me some more it got to where I could hardly walk and go to work.  the weird thing is that my vascular dr. gave me this medication and not my Rheumatologist.  you would think hat my RA dr would have chose to give me this medication. ,5

"I've had some itchy, weeping arm bumps for months and originally the doctor put me on doxcy thinking it was a bacterial infection.  Didn't work.  Prednisone is flattening the bumps but the itching remains.  I am halfway through a 12-day course so we'll see.",4
I have taken this for reducing nasal polyps for several years now. I take a 5 day dose as needed usually about every  3-5 months depending on how severe my symptoms from the polyps are. Once on it my polyps and the swelling in my throat and eyes decreases within 2 days and my sense of smell and taste returns. It also offsets the minor COPD and asthma issues I have. With the reduced swelling I think more clearly and have more drive and energy. The effects last for 2 to 4 months. I am currently trying it in combination with a 30 day dosage of amoxycilin which has been shown to increase the length of the benefits. ,5
I've been taking prednisone 5 to 10 mg for 2 years. It's the only drug that has worked for me. Have tried dmards but am allergic or have horrible side effects. Won't try methotrexate. Most people that are on it take prednisone anyway. I have not gained weight.  I get bone scans annually and X-rays to make sure it is not impacting my bones. Until it does this is the drug for me for RA. My doctor isn't happy about it.  If she continues I will find another doctor. You have to do research and know what's best for you. ,5

"In 2006, at age 59, I underwent a broncoscopy that revealed I had an inflammatory condition in the lining of the lungs known as BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterating Organizing Pneumonia).  I was put on 6 months of a high daily dosage of prednisone.  I recovered from the BOOP ....   BUT, the cartilage in both hips was eroded, the ligaments, muscles in my adductors and hip flexors contracted.  I have vey little range of motion...leading to instability, pain, etc.  I am looking at hip replacements.  The onset of this problem happened two weeks into taking the prednisone when I found I could no longer straddle my horse without enormous restriction and pain.    I went from being an active walker, rider, etc. to being guarded in all my movements.  The doctor'r response...""at least you're alive"".  Hmmm...there's gotta be a better drug.",4

"It's a wonderful drug and an awful drug at the same time.  It made my cough tolerable so I wasn't gagging, throwing up and pulling muscles in my ribs, but I gained 50 pounds and got severe reflux.  Now I have to worry about increased cholesterol, reflux, risk to my bones, etc.  But if I don't take the prednisone, I can't function, so it's what I have to do.  I have decreased the amount, though (and supplemented it with other drugs), so my face isn't fat anymore and I'm not super-hyper like I was at higher doses. ",4

Migraines comes easier when on Prednisone, but it takes just as long to go away....too long.

"I was diagnosed with RA in the 1990s. Fast forward, I took 5 mg of Prednisone for daily for about five years for my Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis.  The medication worked well for me in terms of my mobility and lack of flare ups.  However, three years ago I was diagnosed with Cataracts and had surgery for one eye. My second surgery has never been completed for a variety of reasons, such as infections and uncontrolled Diabetes.   About a year and a half ago my Prednisone was stopped abruptly and my health has taken a turn for the worst. I have relentless flare ups. Most of my joints are affected with stiffness and lacks range of motion and mobility. I am now using a walker to ambulate. Most of my joints are affect my shoulders, wrists, legs etc. My ability to complete many daily living activities is compromised, bathing and especially dressing and combing my hair. It is a debilitating experience which drains my energy and spirit.  I am currently being evaluated for abnormal liver functions and other blood abnormalities and infections. A treatment plan cannot be started until I have a liver biopsy. I am afraid of the side effects for many of the biologics which are available.

Medicine caused increased urination every two hours the first day, every 45 minutes the second day. On second day menstrual bleeding started. Medicine also caused increased hunger and thirst, yet also reduced inflammation in my knees and ankles (arthritis).  I now have a flat taste in my mouth.

"I have emphsema and asthma and when I have an attack it works great.  Used it a few different times and this is the first time I have had side effects.  I feel like I am speeding, clenching my teeth together, jittery, blood sugar sky rocked, sweats really bad.  I hope I never have to use this again.  At least no time soon.  It does work really good and fast though.  When you can't breath because of fluid in your lungs you don't think about the side effects.",5
I get this prescribed from time to time (fairly rarely) when tendonitis of my right shoulder really starts flaring up.  It works really well as an antiinflamitory to bring the pain down and make it easier to heal/rehab the shoulder when it acts up.  The only downside is it can make you slightly nauseous but if taken with food it's very minor for me.,5
"5 mg starting with 7 1st day, then 6,5,4,3,2,1 Breathing much better as I have severe emphysema, not asthma.",4
I have a allergy attack every evening.  I take 1 prednisone with 2 allergex tablets.  It does relieve the symptoms of sneezing and asthma symptoms.,4
"I believe I am allergic to it.  Was given this med repediatly for a swollen eye, that an eye surgeon labeled as Thyroid Eye Disease.  It did help the eye for a while and then the swelling and pain came back shortly after stopping the med.  While I was on the med I became foggy, light headed and had a hard time consentrating.  I also had hand tremmors.  My other DRs.  kept testing me for thyroid disease thinking I had the symptoms before it showed in my blood. Another thought was Graves Disease.  They didn't know what to do for me other than prednisone, This went on for 1 1/2 years, every round of this drug made me feel worse except the swelling went down.  I think that I didn't put 2 & 2 together because of the foggyness etc. Towards the end of this ordeal, I developed unusual headaches and symptoms of stroke twice and both times my blood preasure was approx 120 over 80.      To make this long story short, I refused to go back to the eye surgeon so they sent me to another Eye Dr. who discovered an ulsur on the cornia of that Eye and stopped the prednisone.  She perscribed eye drops and 1 month later It was gone and has not returned and all other symptoms went away.",4
"I found it was effect the first day in relieving my arthritis flare up and as a bridging drug until my regular meds kick in, I did have to keep track of dosages as it decreased gradually. As for side effects, I didn't feel any but I noticed water retention, my face bacame puffy and I broke out quite a bit around my torso. So I felt like a myself again but started to resemble a troll.",4
Prednisone literally crippled me because doctors were too busy practicing medicine to listen to the health problems being caused by the poisons they were prescribing. Do not trust your doctors to know what's best for you if you value your life.,1
"i feel cold especially in my feet and legs all the time, have put on weight ,always hungry and not sleeping. I only take this for 2 weeks 1 daily for a week then 1/2 daily for the second week",4
"I am taking prednisone under Dr. orders at an attempt to determine extreme fatigue, headaches etc.  since taking Predisone, I am now having what I believe to be vocal cord swelling making it very difficult to speak.

"I don't need prednisone very often, but the few times I've needed it, it really did the trick.  It causes a really uncomfortable level of anxiety and moodiness, even if I'm only taking it for a week.  I had IV solumedrol once and it really sucked.  I'll only take steroids if nothing else is working.",5

Could not get out of a chair without using my arms and legs to push me up. This struck me over night. The medication has taken all that away and I can function normally but I have gained over 20 lbs., have no energy and eat constantly. Cannot loose weight even with exercise. I have had sleeping problems for many years but prednisone has made it worse. I am hoping to get off of it soon but my doctor tells me some people with polymyalgia rheumatica have to take it forever.",5

"Cured my poison ivy over a 2 week period. I was on a daily declining 10mg dose from 6tabs daily for 3 days down to 1/2 tab. the last 3 days. This relatively tiny drug dosage has given me a great sense of well being, renewed energy, sunny outlook on life with renewed purpose. I've briefly tried 3 difference RX's for minor depression and all gave me dark and dreary thoughts with some disturbing delusions. I stopped each after just 2 days as they were scary and altered my psyche. Prednisone is the perfect antidepressant medicine for me. I am hoping my doctor will prescribe a minimal daily dose to keep this new mood and attitude and general sense of hopefulness and well being about life. Initially, at 6 tabs./day,, I was slightly ""wired"" and woke up at 4 or 5 a.m. On the reduced dose (1 Tab/day) I have no problem with sleeping but still have more energy during the day.  My arthritis is better too in my wrists. This works for me totally stopped and cleared the awful itching and rash of poison ivy I had.",5

I also had a tightening in my throat and sweating with chills following when I first started taking it. Now that I am tapering off I have increased pain, decreased mobility, and constipation.

"This dangerous drug is often first line defense by physicians in prescribing treatment for inflammatory diseases as well as lung diseases. It's side effects are numerous. It is dangerous when combined with most commonly prescribed drugs, it seems, like diuretics for example. It some studies it has been known to cause steroid psychosis in some patients. This medication should be banned in the United States. In my opinion it is just as bad as adding adjuvants to immunizations and not telling the patients the full risk involved. My experience was horrible and I was at deaths door because of this medication. I finally weaned myself from it and have never felt better in my life! Of course my physician didn't like the fact that I did that, but likes the improvement!  Physicians. LISTEN TO YOUR PATIENTS, they know their bodies better than you do!",1

The first day I often need to double my boluses, but by the end of the second day, this seems to no longer be a problem.  It's a hassle, but sometimes prednisone is just necessary.  If you are on injections,  stay in close contact with your endo about adjustments in your injections.  The other problem is the hunger.  Keep lean proteins (like diabetic diet shakes or those w/ under 3 grms sugar.  DO NOT USE ATKINS.  Other helpful snacks: veggies w/ low cal dip, turkey jerky, or sf jello.  The protein keeps you full longer and the other items give you something to chew on that won't change your food plan much.  Good luck!

I have more energy when on prednisone, and a better quality of life. But, it takes increasing amounts to maintain the results. 8 works better than the 5 I am supposed to be taking.  So I am trying to find alternatives - which is not easy with being allergic to aspirin and other aspirin related products. When I lower the dose, my legs swell. Yep, I react differently than others do.",5

"I was put on Prednisone ten years ago for chronic uticaria (hives) . Since I've been on it I've gained 125 pounds!!  I feel horrible when I take it!  I now have what's called moon face as the prednisonse makes your face really round and puffy. I used to take 40 to 60 mgs. per day and took them all at once but the side effects were just to intense. I would feel as if I had drank 2 pots of coffee, I would sweat horribly and my arms and legs felt like jello. Now I have to take 10mgs. every 5-6 hrs. this took care of a lot of the side effects however... Now since I have been on it for so long I have a whole bunch of other problems that have started! About a month ago I noticed a terrible pressure/bloated feeling in my stomach. It just keeps getting worse and I swear at different times through out the day I look like I'm 9 months pregnant and if I wait to long to take it I start getting really nauseous. So, I feel like crap if I take it and crap if I don't just different levels of crap!  Oh yeah and about 6 months ago I started loosing my hair but its coming in nicely on my face! If I don't take the Prednisone then my entire face, head and body breaks out in huge painful hives. I've been put on every anti -histamine and nothing but prednisone works. I was recently put on Cell -Cept hoping it will suppress my immune system and then I can tapper off the Prednisone. ",5

"to me this is a wonder drug. I have lived with recurring sinus problems for the last 20 years - evn had two surgeries.  When I get a sinus infection Ispecifically ask for it now.  I also suffer from Fibromyalgia and while taking the prenisone, I can get out of bed with ease in the morning.  Negitive side effects - increased appitite, insomnia, grouchy- but the benefit far out weighs.  I wish I could talk my artritis doc to put me on for my fibro and nerve pain",5

My doctor wanted me to try this drug to relieve the inflamation & pain in my hands. Most other drugs were not effective. The pred. really did work - started with 30mg & went down to 5mg.Even at the low dose it was working. But after 2 months at 5mg - it was time to get off. That is when the side effects kicked in. It was spiking my blood sugar & making me feel like I was having cadiac problems -- Pain in the left shoulder - rapid heart beat - weakness - high blood pressure.This was not expected because I never had any adverse reactions when I was using the drug. JUST BE CARFUL ON THE WAY DOWN.,5

The nest morning i felt different, and the days following i went into a severe depression that lasted months. Worst time of my life.

Have had a chronic skin problem identified as eczematous dermatitis for nearly one year.  Thus far the only remedy in controlling the outbreak is high doses 60MG to 40MG.  Usually starting with 60MG for 7 days and begin a taper .  My doctors at present are using Prednisone as a bridge drug in order to implement a cellcept type drug for longer term use,5
I have had bouts of scleritis in both eyes since I was 17. I am now 59. 10 years ago I had a really bad inflamation in my rt. eye. It was diagnosed as Necrotizing scleritis.  The pain was excruciating. The problem can cause you to lose your eye.  The only thing that helped was 70mg doses of Prednisone 3 times a day for 3 days then the dose was lowered till it now 15mg pr day. I have all the bad sidefects of the drug. But considering to alternitive.  The pain or having my eye removed. Its hard but I chose not to be blind.,4

"Prescribed for shoulder and elbow pain, possibly a pinched nerve in the neck.  Probable cause, too much golf. Took for three days on the 12 day regimen.  Helped with the pain, however, side effects not good.  Side effects include: flushing, indigestion and ulcer type pain, odd sense of smell and taste.  Coffee smelled and tasted like sour vinegar.  Quit taking after 3rd day.  Arm and elbow pain has returned.  Taking Aspirin, at least I know what to expect.",3
"Taking this right now to help with an RA flare-up. It has worked wonders with the pain but after only a week and a half, I'm anxious to wean off of it. My heart feels like its racing or pounding most of the time (have been monitoring blood pressure; all is fine) and it has made me a huge grouch!  Yes, prednisone has its great qualities but it's left me wondering if being pain-free is worth the other side effects.",5
"About 30 minutes after taking the first round of pills my nose began to open up and I could breathe. The only problem is that after I finish my 9 day dosage, after about 3 weeks I'm back to where I was with the inflammation in the nasal cavity. I didn't have any side effcts from the medication nor did I gain weight which was one of the side effects my Dr said would probably happen.",5
"I have taken a Prednisone 'burst' twice for RA flare-ups. Each time I take it, within 3 or 4 days I am feeling much less pain and stiffness. I do get some heart palpitations on the higher dose, but it goes away as I taper off. Unfortunately, when I stop taking it, my pain and stiffness goes up a little, but so far never to the point it was before. Seems like magic during a flare-up. Prednisone makes me really hungry and have a lot of energy. ",5
"I was diagnosed w/Crohn's Disease in 1976 and have been on Prednison since then.  I finally had to have an ileostomy in 1980, but still take Prednisone to keep down flare-ups of joint pain.  I have a bone density scan done approximately every 2 years.  My doctor told me that I have osteopenia but he fully expected my bones to be ""mush"" from the prednisone.  It has caused cataracts in both eyes for which I'll have my first surgery in December 2012.  I am debating now whether to continue w/the prednisone or try Remicade or Humira.  After much consideration, I've decided to continue taking the 10mg of Prednisone that I take every day.  Overall, Prednisone has helped me.  I feel that the pros outweigh the cons.",5

"UC patient, 3rd time on prednisone. 1st time it got me out of flare in a month.  2nd time, had to be hospitalized for 2 weeks, crazy.  This time, I think we got it taken care of.  Drug works very well to control my falres, BUT the side effects are awful.  Moodiness, one day I'm euphoric, the next I'm not fun to be around.  Some sleeplessness.  Night sweats, though that could be from the flare itself?  But the worst, for me being a woman, is the increase in appetite and lack of energy.  I gain weight every time I'm on it.  Too tired to do anything about it.  I have to wait until I'm done tappering off before I can start running again.  Hurts my joints to be overly active while on a heavy dosage.  However, when I start a flare, I cannot find prendisone fast enough!  It's the drug I hate to love and love to hate.  Get me off of it! (but don't let me flare again!!)  Catch 22...  Good luck with it.  Remember, it's  STEROID!!  Roid rage is real.",4

While it does help with the cough and breathing issues, I have only took one dose (40 mg) I suddenly feel like my legs and feet are swelling...after reading the side effects pamplet from the pharmacy, I know it must be this medication and not the others I have for the bronchitis. Has anyone else had issues with swelling and pain? I just have that feeling of soarness and swelling, like being on your feet all day and never resting your legs!",3

B10 for Before transplant it was in bursts or tapers 100 mg. for 3 days 50 for 3 days 25 for 3 days 10 for 3 days and finally 5 for 3 days. The side effects were sleeplessness sweating high sugar levels mood swings it was a roller coaster. now after transplant I am on a daily dosage of only 10mg. most of the side effects have leveled out with the exception of excessive sweating, water retention and weight gain along with loss of muscle tone. Prednisone also depletes testosterone which causes the muscle tone loss, weight gain(60lbs in a year)swollen face(moon face). Don't just stop taking it especially if you are prescribed a large dose. It's nasty but it does do it's job and it's better than the alternative ..rejection..",4

"I have taken oral prednisone for over twenty years , and had shots of it too.  But over the last year and a half my bones in left leg have started necrosis (dying) and very painful.  Specialist doctor in Dallas, Texas finally came to conclusion that years of prednisone use had led to my current problems with my leg (ankle, knee, and hip) , and there's not much can do to correct this, since damage has been already done.  Was told just to go back to family doctor for pain management and start physical therapy in salt water resistance pool (which does help).  But i have to wonder what my baby girl is going through , having to use prednisone because of multiple cases of pnemonia and asthma ?  and i wonder if anybody else have experienced bone death (infarctions, necrosis) because of prednisone use accumulation ?  Although this drug did help reduce inflammation in my lungs, the side affects have been ultimately detrimental .  Be very careful if you are prescribed this drug over and over for whatever cause , the side affects will get worse and worse.  Best of luck though, not everyone has this problem.  ",5

"I was prescribed Prednisone for bronchitis to reduce inflamation.  Took it for 3 days and was feeling better.  Then on the 3rd day my entire check area of my face was covered in broken purple capilliaries.  Went to the ER freaked out as I looked like a monster.  The doc said it's a side effect rare of the prednisone and wanted me to keep taking it.  Yet, when I asked if the broken capillaries on my face (disgusting) would go away if I continue to use this drug, the doc said that the condition could possibly be permanent.  Are you kidding me?  No way am I going to keep taking this drug.  It's been 10 hours since the rash of broken facial capilliaries covered my face and thank God it's started to fade.  I am not a vain freak but no one will I become permanently facially disfigured for this medication.  Going to see another doc there has to be something less dangerous for inflamation of the bronchial tubes.  ",4
"It helps not only for my bronchitis, but the pain I have from arthritis in my hip, ankle and knee.  ",5
"taking 20mg per day (at Least) since 1970, (42 years!!)now side effects are killing me. such as: heart disease, glaucoma, cataracts, cushings syndrome (paperthin skin & stretch marks), muscle wknes, depression, arterial- clorosis,high bp & cholesterol, rheumatoid arthritis, supressed immune system, osteopsorosis, pneumonia, weight gain, increased white cell count & decreased red cells,large belly fragile bones& much more to list. I sneezed at work & broke 3 & fractured 2 ribs (thanks to prednisone)  I had 2 heart attacks & 2 strokes (l&r) in a 1 1/2yr period both from walking pneumonia(which is another side effect from prednisone). But without prednisone, nasty as it is,, I would be dead.  Now I take major vitamins & supplements to combat some of the side effects.  I now rattle when I walk, but at least I'm still here TO walk.  Word of advise, don't suddenly stop taking prednisone,whatever you're taking it for, as that illness will come back 10 fold! See an ophamologist, get regular bone density scans, breathing tests and try to C a dentist (as prednisone will affect dental work)  ",5
"I was prescribed a 10 day regimen of 30MG Prednisone a day for Bell's Palsy 5 years ago. Most of the Palsy went away but within two days of stopping the medication, I developed painful swelling of my neck and chest pain. I ended up at the ER room and they said it was a side effect of the drug. After that I developed all sorts of conditions that I never had - GERD, Dry Eye Syndrome, muscle spasms, chronic fatigue, mild asthma, chronic sinusitis, too many to name. I truly believe that it was the Prednisone that gave me all these conditions because I was a healthy 22 year old man at the time, and now I am always sick",4
"I took this for the first (and probably only) time for a severe case of poison ivy/poison oak.  I wish I had read these reviews before taking the pred, because I've had about every bad symptom possible: shaking, nervousness, a feeling of being uneasy in my own body, dizzy, room spinning.  I've had no trouble sleeping, but since I've been drinking a lot of water to try and minimize the effects, I've been spending a lot of time in the bathroom.  Started with 50mg the first day and nearly went to the emergency room.  Dose was reduced to 30mg for 4 days, 20mg for 4 days, 10mg for 4 days and 10mg for 4 days to taper off.  I'm down to my final dose and will NEVER take it again.  It worked, but I'd rather suffer through the poison ivy.

"I breath so much easier, and haven't had any severe coughing spells since I been on this med. after three weeks, no side effects as of this time.",4
I feel great after taking this medication. I experience pain in my heels when walking. I use this med with taper down dosing when on vacation and or walking a lot.I have no pain and I actually lose weight when on this med.

"Male 68 treated for tinnitus in left ear. Doctor said fluid build up in inner ear was causing the noise to be louder. 20mg twice a day for three days, 20mg once a day for three days then half app. 10mg for four days. I have two days to go on half pill. Not fun to take I also had to take Prilosec to keep it from huring my stomach and I still at times has some slight pain. Effected my sleep but the noise does seem to be better but time will tell if it will last or not. I was in pretty good shape if not I might have had more problems. Not sure I will take it again but if it keeps the noise down will be worth the few problems. I can put up with the side effects for a few days to get some results but will it last who knows for sure tinnitus is tough to find anything that helps. ",4

Side effects are minimal, a bit off and cant pin point it, but nothing that affected me at work today.",5

"Given the prednisone to bring down inflammation from chronic sinusitis. Dose started at 60 mg for 5 days, then down to 40 for 5 days, and then down to 20 for five days. Really helped open sinuses. I am able to taste, and smell again and both ears are much more open. It did make me feel a little hyper on the higher does. It also gave me heartburn which is getting better now that I have completed the course. Overall, helpful and no terrible side effects.",5
reduced muscle pain,4
"This was used for a breathing problem but i noticed it has been keeping me awake at nights,sweating,thirst and cramps everywhere also oily skin. Almost done with the prednisone bad side effects.",2
I was prescribed this medicine with my MS. I couldn't sleep very well before the medicine because of the MS but after taking the medicine my legs feel better and I have better control over them however I can't sleep. I wake in pain with my stomach. I'm constantly light headed and dizzy. My headaches are much more frequent. I'm disoriented a lot and there is pressure behind my eyes. Constantly in the bathroom with this medicine. I've become more depressed and had hard times breathing on this medicine. The medicine worked and treated my MS. However in my opinion the side effects far outway the pros here. ,4
"Was recently diagnosed with CMV. Just spent 13 days in hospital. Started off with 100% oxygen but finally tapered off. Due to lung inflammation, been on prednisone. Last two days my legs have been major bothering me. Sems like the pain is in my bones. Not only can I not sleep with this drug, I can't sleep Witt this pain. Took 2 oxycodone during the night but didn't help. Any suggestions?",3
"This is the best medication I have ever had.  The side effects can be cumbersome,b ut if you follow the suggestions for managing the side effects, it worth it all.  I've taken prednisone off an on since 1980, for asthma, atopic dermatitis, and systemic lupus.  I am allergic to just about everything, but this medication is what really keeps me going.  It does cause me to have mood swings when I'm on it in large doses continuously, however, I take naps, read, do a puzzle, anything to get me out of the funk.  It's my wonder drug.  I have even lost weight while on predinisone.   It made me fat, then I lost the weight by eating a low carbohydrate diet of five meals a day with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and water.  I could even continue eating my Little Debbie cakes (sn)I'm 57 years old, 5'1, and weigh 135 pounds.",5
I started the drug 10/2011 - about 3 mo's ago my skin became thin and easily abused.  A slight bump would lay open a large area of skin which I would trim off.   I also take plavix which restricts the healing process.  Sharing the house with a Rotty pup plus much outdoor activity causes me to look like the loser of a bar fight.  ,4
I am on a 40 mg dose a day to help slow down my cluster headaches.  I was having two headaches every other day.  I have been on the prenizone for two weeks and only had two headaches.  ,5
"The only thing I can't tolerate is the increased sweating and very frequent urination especially at night. It's like I have over active bladder.  This could be a good thing since I have Lymphedema in both my legs, so losing some excess fluid would be very good.  The other thing I noticed is that I have an increased appetite.  I really don't need this since I'm already over weight to begin with.  But lately, I've been thirsty like never before; the more I drink, the more I have to urinate.  I do feel some muscle weakness in my legs, but a few months ago, I twisted my knee the wrong way and was unable to walk w/my right leg.  My knee still isn't healed yet, I'm still hobbling around.  I think the prednisone helped w/the swelling/inflamation.  This medication has good uses, I just wish that some of the side affects weren't so hard on my body.",5
It seems to help the inflamation in my lung a lot.,5
"My heart races, i have NO energy. I was stung by wasps and had to use my Epi Pen then take this med for 5 days. I have been on it before and it scares me the side effects are bad. I can't stand to take it. Even with diet i am to weak to exercise so I gain weight, can't sleep, cramped legs, headaches, tired and irritable. I think they need to come up with a new med that has less side effects that are not so harmful. ",2

"Chronic Sinus infec. worsened by lack of post nasal drip rx's (ephederan?) etc. drainage pills pulled, causes constant infections, pollup growth etc. led to constantly taking Prednisone to lesson all affects of this condition, but as soon as I get off of a dose pack, within a week, I have increased mucus/phlem buildup, coughing and choking, shortness of breath and have to go back on Prednisone. This condition aggrevates my Pulmonary and heart and lower back muscles (brought on by excessive coughing) which increased doctor calls and associated costs when it all comes back to Sinus problems, 2 operations in year hasn't corrected it, and never was a problem as long as I took Entex LA or equiv. Rx since early 1980's. As soon as all this medicines were pulled or outlawed or whatever, This condition has been ever present and uncomfortable and expensive (added insurance costs too) when it shouldn't have to be. The prednisone  does help, but leaves a trail of side effects on me, leg cramps, muscle tightness etc.",5
"I have minor asthma and was prescribed 30 mg/day of prednisone for two weeks.  After one week, the cough/asthma has improved a bit but feeling rather dizzy and increased heartrate.

"I thought I was ready for the walker or wheel chair. I tried every over the counter with no results and only got worse...I'm too young to live like this so I went to the ER and the wonderful doctor gave me a shot of this steroids and a script for reducing dose. I felt better after 1 hour after the shot and 1/2 a day after starting the pills...I can almost bend over! Yes there are some side-effects... hungry, tired, etc but nothing that is bad enough to stop! PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT ATTIUDE IS EVERYTHING WHEN YOU HAVE A CRONIC ILLNESS.... LOOK FOR SOME SUNSHINE AND FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE THINGS THIS MED DOES, NOT THE NEGATIVE!",5

I was on the drug for three months and felt normal.  When my doctor wanted me to reduce the dosage, the pain generally came back.  Now at 5mg to 2and a half mg I am not happy.  I didn't have any bad side effects while on the 10 mg once a day. Now I have to supplement with Aleve. This is a miracle drug for me.",5

"It significantly lessons inflamation when I am having a rheumatoid flare up, I immeditately begin with 50 mg that day for 2-4 days then decrease by 10 mg there after until I am back to which is normal for me 10 mg per day.the only thing I found between reducing the levels of prednisone around 30 -40 mg per day is when I experience some emotional upset, but once past that I am ok, things like over reacting to say something negative at work so I now realize this and know that at this time will remain calm knowing my brain function isn't quite on. I have been on this drug for over two years, try to stay at 10 mg per day, along with the time release morphine that I am on to manage the pain ad keep going to work each day.  glad I take it, otherwise I would be incapable of working at all.",5

"I contracted reiters syndrome while in the military, this is a condition resulting in extreme inflammation of the joints and serious eyeritis which results in massive amounts of white blood cells filling the eye ball. I was prescribed large doses of aspirin to alleviate the joint problems and large doses of prednisone to save the eyes from the white blood cell assault. It worked,  however over the course of continued use of oral prednisone for every eyeritis attack the blood supply to my major joints was destroyed. I had to have six joint replacements over the years, both shoulders and both hips x 2. Now the doctors use localized injections of prednisone in the eye to stabilize the eyeritis attacks. If possible DO NOT TAKE ORAL PREDNISONE as is will not localize but rather effect your entire body in a very detrimental manner.",5

I had to take prednisone last year because of an allergic reaction to tramadol. Never again. after i was finished taking it for a week i had stiffness in my neck i couldn't hardly move it and more back pain than normal then started having muscle spasms in my neck and numbness and tingling in my hand. i went to a neurologist he said it was a side affect of prednisone that was a year ago. today i am still suffering from neck spasms and my back has gotten worse. so i'm constantly going for tests to see what is wrong which my dr believes it is from taking the prednisone.,3

Side effects: I was somewhat more hungry....I did have slight problems with sleeping, I think I was jus afraid. But tha most side effect I experienced was BEING JITTERY!!!! Ohmygoodness I was at wk and my hands were constantly shaking and I felt so alert always like I was on speed or something. U definitely can tell your on something. I got off the medicine on feb 20th.

"16 yrs ago I was diagnosed with RA. Prednisone is still the most effective thing I've been given.  Aside from the beginning I've been on 5-7.5 mg ever since except for a year of hell on other drugs. I consider the side effects (a few pounds, etc.) minor compared to the alternatives.  Don't go to expensive drugs more likely to give you cancer or otherwise kill you before at least trying this.

"I was prescribed Prednisone for an allergic reaction Doctors believe to be attributed by a new drug I was taking.  Even after an injection and then taking it orally, there doesn't seem to be much change.   Normally when I've taken it for other health issues, it helped tremendously.",2

One entire side of my head on my cheek and back to the ear was swollen. I took only 2 of the Lortab the day I went to the doctor. It had finally kicked in and my pain was gone. However, that very same evening, I threw up 6 times until it was just the dry heaves. I continued until I couldn't stay awake. Upon getting up the next morning, I found myself covered in huge hives on every place except my face and forearms. Vomiting continued a few more times and then we went to the doctor again. He prescribed this Prednisone. It was working somewhat because I am not scratching anymore. The hives are still on me and now I seem to have trouble getting to sleep tonight. I am fairly certain that Prednisone caused this issue.",2
"With COPD for many years, I have had many bouts of restricted breathing whereas I have many days, weeks & months of wheezing off and on. When this is worse and much wheezing I use Predisone starting at 40-50 mg daily and reduce doseage by 10 mg every 5 days till I get down to 5mg and by than my air passages are generally clear & non restrictive and breathing freely.

"I have been on NSIDS for 23 years (always taking the very lowest dosage possible). In the summer of 2010 I suddendly could not move. I could not get out of bed, take care of myself, could not sleep, dress myself and so much more. The pain was so bad I can not describe it.  I saw so many doctors thru my Medicare (and $$ out of pocket). Had MRI's and other tests. Every doctor just said Arthritis, Arthritis, Arthritis. I tried Accupunture many times. This went on for 6 months-just suffering. I changed my Medicare plan January 1st, 2011 and got all new doctors.  (The new doctors were not on my old Medicare plan.)  The new doctor immediately suggested a decresing short term dose of Predisone.  Within two days I started saying to everyone 'look I can raise my arm a little, I can breath, I can turn my head, I can hold my fork myself and I feel better'. The severe pain decreased a little more each day but when I was down to the last day (only one pill a day) of the Rx I started feeling bad again, not as bad as before but was hurting.  Even my hips and knees were not so painful as they had been for 20 years. When I went back to the Doctor, he said if I took the Prednisone all the time, there would be negitive side effects.  But the pain was back. I asked if I could take a very low dosage. I had done my homework, had read and taked with my primary doctor.  It was agreed that I could try 5ml once a day. That was a year ago.  I am almost pain free and can live a normal life, travel to see my 6 children, 11 grandchildren and my 10 great grandchildren!! All without surgery, cortisone shots and NSIDS!! I have recently started a bussiness that I have wanted to do for many years. I am very thankful.    ",5

My doctor switched the dosing schedule to every other day. He said the good effects last 48 hours, the bad only 4 hours. Over the years I have struggled with weight gain. Also I tend to overdo because I don't feel tired, but when I stop, I drop with exhaustion. My bone density  is good, and at 60 yrs of age only recently developed arthritis in hands. I have had cataract surgery in both eyes, numerous torn muscles and tendons, and now type 2 diabetes. I tell people that if the prednisone doesn't cure it, it will cause it.

"I have Lupus and I have to take this as a maintenance drug for the rest of my life. I take 40 miligrams a day and will be lowered to 30 miligrams next week. It has relieved my joint pain and fatigue, which is good, but the side effects are hard to handle. I combat the terrifying panic and anxiety attacks with Valium and Risperdal, but they can still come.I lose sense of reality also, and the worst part is feeling like you could lose control. I cry often and it is hard to find solace knowing I have to take this hard core drug for the rest of my life.There is considerable weight gain, around twenty pounds, but this can be combated with diet and exersize. I can't sleep and have frequent nightmares.I have bloating and diarrhea. I would reccomend this drug only if you really require it since the side effects are  difficult. It really does help but I still wish I didn't have to take it.",4
"I am sixteen years old and have Systemic Lupus. I have to take this as a maitenence drug for the rest of my life. It has eased my joint and fatigue issues, but there is a long list of side effects.To counter act the extreme anxiety and unease,I take Risperdal, but that is not enough. I still become scared and afraid of losing control. I cannot sleep and I have nightmares. I've gained a total of twenty pounds, but that can easily be controlled with diet and exersize. The worst part of this drug is feeling like you might hurt somebody. It's hard to feel calm.Overall, I think it works well, but it does have a bad taste. It's a good thing most people don't have to stay on this for life. I take 40 mgs a day,I used to take 60.We are trying to lower it down to 30.

I have chronic acute eczema and take prednisone very sporadically when I am having a very bad flare-up.

My skin was normal before.  The rash is better, but still have some.  Have been off for 3 days, and my skin feels  terrible and dry.  Has anyone else had this side effect?  I will not go on this drug again.",3
"I have been diagnosed with Sarcoidosis a few months back and was prescribed Prednisone 40 mg.. at first the medication was very hard to adjust to as it made me have imense insomnia, night sweats, jittery, and cause a slight weight gain. It is helping making the diease manageable and the benefits of the drug overrule the side effects. Now I am taking 40mg every other day and the side effects have diminished about 70 percent. I hope everyone can have a somewhat good experience with this medication as I am.",4
"I'm Bipolar 2, so taking prednisone is hard on my mental state.",4
I am often on prednisone starting out at 60mg per day as my asthma is pretty bad.  The side affects are the worst for me and my family to handle.  My mood changes and I swear I could hurt someone.  I also feel very strong and huge (puffy).  My stomach looks like I am pregnant and the sweats are horrible!!!!  But.............I can breathe!!!,5

befor i was on prednisone i was at an 8 to 10 in pain now im at 4 and 5 ,4
"I have SLE, but came down with auto-immune hepatitis over the summer, which is when I started the Prednisone.  They started me out at 60mg, and while it worked wonderfully for all of my SLE symptoms (joint pain, itchy flaky patches of skin) and for reducing the inflammation in the liver, it made me crazy.  I had severe depression, anxiety, bouts of mania, was shaky, dizzy, and generally felt awful.  It wasn't until I was down to 20mg a day that the symptoms were at a don't-want-to-kill-myself level.  I am at 10mg right now and am still experiencing some shakiness and dizziness as well as weight gain and moon face, but I can live with those things.  The emotional side effects were the worst.  I wouldn't wish those feelings on anyone.   Prednisone for me has been a blessing and a curse.  ",5
"works well, only take when needed",5
"Prednisone seems to be the only medication that is working to eliminate my chronice asthma symtoms. It allows me to cough up phlem, and then prevents it from reoccuring when I am on it. All my congestion clears up and I no longer have headaches and plugged ears so severe that I cannot hear. The benefits out weigh the side effects for me, as I have been fortunate and have only had heart burn and some stomach issues with it and some blurred vision. I have iv pred with a asthma attack and it brought me right out of it.",5
i have had pneumonia 5 times. it was always prescribed to me and i was always told to taper off not abruptly stop as is the case this time around. as a result im not any better.,2
"Received 6 doses in my iv the 2 days I was in the hospital, then did 7 days of 20 mg and 7 days of 10 mg. I have used prednisone before, but this is the 1st time I experienced all over weak, achy feeling, headaches, stomach upset/heartburn and a number of other stomach/intestinal issues. Oh, not to mention all puffed up and bloaty looking >:/ Helped my asthma greatly, like always. Took my last dose 3 days ago and still feel the side effects! Can't get over how crappy I feel!! My Dr. says it's from the large amount of iv doses she gave me. Hoping it's a fluke as I'm sure it wont be the last time I'm given this stuff...",5
I was born with ezcema. The older I get the worse it gets. I have it all over my body.Been to so many doctors and the only thing that makes the itching stop is predn4isone.

I have been taking his drug for 24 years yes It has some bad side effects I have gained alot of weight when I started taking It I weight 98 pounds now Im 250 I hate It but It allows me to have some life that I can live without it I dont know what i would do i know it isnt good with the side effects but Im living for today Im not going to worry about tomorrow,5
I'm very satisfied and it did correct my asthma attack. It was prescribed by my Doctor by Fax at my Drug Store which is near to my place and got it within 1/2 hour after calling my doctor during my attack. Prednisone did the trick!,4
Horrible!  The Absolute Worst Drug EVER and Doctors should Hand Out a Warning With the Prescription...NOT AFTER YOU FILL IT & YOUR HMO HAS PAID FOR IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT! RUINED MY LIFE!,2
"have been taking on and off for the last 5 months for sinus pain, and pain due to a pinched nerve in my neck. The side effects are bothersome, but the pain and symptom relief is well worth enduring the side effects. One warning I would give: don't stop this drug cold turkey! I did this once and thought I was going to die. I experienced severe dizziness, chest pain, and severe muscle pain. Also had knots in my stomach and back. When taken as directed, it can be quite helpful.",5

"I have emphysema, fibrosis, bronchitis. Although the side effects are many and excessive it allows me to breath.....that is worth a fortune. I control the side effects rather than allow them to control me! ",4
"I had a bad cough and sore throat.  I was put on 20 mg. twice a day.  I took a whole pill the first night.  I felt sick the next day so I broke them in half, figuring that I could take the 40 mg. daily but broken up to take them 4 times instead of twice.  I had times when my tongue would swell.  I actually lost weight because of it working on my inflamation in my body.  I had plenty of energy and slept well.  I just got tired of my tongue swelling and having the most hideous sweats.  It felt like my whole body was on fire.  I am old enough to have gone through menopause but these sweats were something I had never experienced.  I stopped taking them early.  I was to take them for 5 days.  The side effects still bother me and it's a week later.  I am still having the sweats.  A day after stopping the meds I couldn't even lay on my back in bed.  I have a hard time in walking, doing normal stuff.  I believe I would have been better off using a cough syrup religiously, taking an antibiotic.  The script did the job but to me it wasn't worth the side effects.  I wondered if perhaps the 20 mgs were too high a dose.  I contacted my doctors office and have heard nothing back from her so I tend to think it's time for a new doctor.  I will not be taking this med again.  I'm pleased that others have had a good experience with it.  I was told by my other doctor (not medical) that I was allergic to it and to not take it again.  My daughter in law has told me never to take it again and she is a cna mtech.  ",5
"It keeps me from wheezing, coughing, gurgling, etc. but the weight keeps piling on, even when I am down to about 1,000-1,200 calories a day.  Have gone from about 170- 220 over the last two years, even watching my food intake.  Unfortunately, it has also affected my vision in a negative manner......",3
"I CAN BREATH BETTER BUT I AM HIGHLY AGGITAED EASYILY ANGERED, NERVOUS I WANT TO STOP THIS MEDICINE",5
"I was on 10mg pred,staggered over 12 days for a COPD exacerbation.  After the 1st dose it felt like heaven, it really opened up my lungs.  After fighting this for 2 mo's I finally went to the dr. I took the last dose 3 days ago. While taking it I had leg cramps, trouble sleeping, etc., but yesterday was the worst.  I had an anxiety attack, muscles felt weak, cold sweats, blood rushing hot flashes and very depressed and nervy.  It was awful. I may have some comfort to some of you however.  I have been taking Vitamin d3 since Feb and a few days ago I ran out and had not taken any.  As soon as i got a new bottle I took 2 soft gels (1000 iu's ea) and almost instantly felt better.  Later in the evening that same feeling came back and I took another vitamin.  The spell lasted about an hour before it went away.  It was scary!  We live in Texas and the allergies out here are worst in late months Sep-Nov, ragweed kicks my butt every year! And bronchitus. I waited too long to go to the Dr and the steroids kicked it out of me but I hate the side affects.  I could write 3 paragraphs on the benefits of Vitamin D3. It actually lifts your spirits if you are down in the dumps and it gives you an overall feeling of well being.  Go to vitamindcouncil.org and read up on it.  My dr suggested I take Vit D3 in Feb when I had a cold.  I could feel a difference after two days!  At first she prescribed 5000 iu's a day because I was depleted of vitamin d, now I take 1 to 2 soft gels a day.  At any rate if prednisone medicine makes you feel blue and achy, vit d certainly can't hurt you and it might help.  whenever the Dr's want me to try something new I always go to these boards and read them and they help me.  It's hard enough when you have a health condition, that is depressing enough, but when the cure is worse than the disease thats hard to take.  Hope this helps someone to know we all know how you feel.  ",4

Also this drug made me extremely ""Hyper"" so I couldn't stop working, starting five projects or tasks at once and never quite completing any of them.

Get bone density tests and have your doctor prescribe a bone loss prevention compound. Prednisone is the difference between being bed-ridden and getting out of the house. Each time I begin a new protocol; the side effects are less problematic.  Sadly, this drug has no impact on the course of my illness.

"In 1999 I was prescribed this drug for asthma.  Within 6 months I had gained 50 pounds. Moon shaped face and hands so swollen that I stopped wearing my rings. My feet went from size 7 to 9. I had chronic asthma and this drug kept me alive but I have been miserable. My hip bones died and I have had three surgeries with one hip replacement. My back has been affected and I have had a back fusion. I am 59 and 205 pounds. At 5'5', I had always been 115 to 125.  Friends and family didn't recognize me the first year on steroids. I kept all my size 8 and 10 dresses, but I finally gave them away two years ago. I'm a size 18 and can't exercise because of my lungs. I just got a prescription yesterday from my pulmonary doctor...more steroids. 60mg for seven days. I haven't had it filled because I just can't stand the thought of the weight gain. 7 pounds a week usually. It won't come off with dieting. It's made me barreled shape with huge arms and breasts. My stomach is 58 inches and I've been treated for depression for the last 12 years. My marriage has failed and I'm a fat, depressed, handicapped old woman when I look in the mirror. I guess this is payback for being so vain about my appearance in my 20s and 30s. This sucks and I'm afraid I might die of asthma rather than continue on this road to obesity. Why do some lose weight and others gain? I can't lift weights at all. I can hardly walk 50 ft without having to rest.

Doctor said it could take 2-3 weeks for my symptoms to go away.  Wondering if anyone else has had this issue.  I'm afraid of what will happen when I have to start decreasing my dosage.

"I have taken Prednisone a lot because of my asthma flaring up when I have a cold. It's always helped me and made me feel better and I've always welcomed taking it like it was my best friend haha. The only side effects I've experienced are increased appetite like no other! Which I don't like but I try and eat healthy snacks. This time around I noticed sweating. It's July so of course it's hot out but the sweating is worse at night while taking the prednisone but hey, my lungs are working, sweating and increased appetite are a small price to pay for breathing! I've never taken it long term, just in ""concentrated bursts"" to kick my lungs back into running after the cold bug has reeked havoc. ",5
developed a terrible headache while i was taken it.,4
"Had a high calcium level - Predisone gave me lots of enery, decreased my calcium level, BUT I gained 60 lbs. over 3 mos.  Always felt so hungry, I couldn't wait to stop taking it.",5

Iwas losing control of my knee's and would fall on stairs, walking on slopes, etc.  5 days of 60 mg, so on. After the third day I noticed relief from knee pain to falling injuries.   I truly appreciate the fact that Prednisone does the job with my injuries!  I can eat food without getting sick now too.",5
"Have taken 2 prednisone pills each MORNING for 5 days. Prescribed due to whooping cough. I feel dis-oriented, light-headed, dizzy, and feel like I have ""no purpose in life"". I watch the news and want to cry when it comes to viewing a sad story. Can't say I'm depressed, but I think I am! Have not had a decent night's sleep in a week now!

It has caused severe mood swings since I have been on it.  I also have increased bloating and sweating.  I am going to refuse this medication the next time I'm prescribed it.

"Have rare case of cystic fibrosis and asthma flares up now and then.  I can't wait to get on pred, but then can't wait to get off it.  Used to give me energy, but makes me fatigued now, melancholy, and I gain weight.  Usually eat a lot on 60 mg and down, but I seem to be able to control it better this time around.  Stomach feels ill at times and can't sleep.  Need to take a sleeping pill.  That has other side effects like a ""hangover effect"" during the day.  It does save my life though.  I too wish there was another druge with less side effects. ",4
"This medication made my stomach hurt real bad and my stools looked like green rocks, lol. It gave me severe headaches, bad enough to have to take my Treximet that I take for migraines. I stopped taking it the second day because of the headaches. I felt a little better, but not worth the headaches, so I just kept taking the antibiotics and cough meds and eventually got over the cough and walking pneumonia that I was prescribed the meds for. Everyone is different, but it I didn't like the side effects. It seems like I have taken this before for pneumonia and never had a problem, so I'm not sure why I reacted diff this time.",3
"What is bothering me is the thinning of the skin. A slight bump, my skin will dark red. A hard bump might peel off the skin.",2
"It caused me to gain weight. I was very irritable, but that outweighed how much better it made me breathe!",5
"Following 2 lung surgeries for aspergillosis and mycobacterium, I developed sarcoidosis and nocardia bacterial infections.  The main symptoms being treated were a chronic cough and fluid in the lungs.  Sarcoidosis has a whole list of symptoms, but prednisone just added to the list of symptoms.  Prednisone alleviated all the symptoms of the diseases, but I have had most of the side effects listed for prednisone.  I am also taking Lasix for water retention, so there has been no swelling or weight gain.  My doctor wants me to take calcium to prevent osteoporosis, but my research shows that I should NOT take calcium if I have sarcoidosis, as the disease itself produces calcium.  My disease is lifelong, so I will be on prednisone for 4 months, wean off, and then take a cancer drug. My doctor said that there are too many permanent side effects to stay on prednisone for long...",5
Befor starting this drug I was having a lot of joint weakness and a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I was on this drug for about a year then my doctor slowly decreased  the dosage. I gained weight but the pain relief was worth it.,5
"Two-week course of shots of prednisone in hospital for kidney failure, then 5-weeks of oral prednisone. In the 6th week of treatment, I began to have severe swelling in the face, neck, legs, ankles, and feet. Doctor has begun tapering the drug down for another 6 weeks. This drug has driven my sugars up to 300 at times, taking insulin to control. I have more than just moon facies from use, but the swelling as well which my doctor (nephrologist) did not seem to be worried about. No HCTZ use, maybe in a few weeks if still persisting. ",5
"After all the tests, no allergies were discovered, so what now.  My Dr. was very reluctant to give me this medication however at the point of not being able to sleep or rest, I implored her to give me this medication.  That night after taking the initial dose, I had the first sound sleep in a long time.  they tell its not good for me long term, but at this point, this is the only thing that works.  I will continue to request it.",5

I have experienced no weight gain - dr. says it is a very small dose. It is the difference in living my life and just getting through a day.

"From a previous comment: After 8 months and tapering off for PMR, I am extremely stiff with painful muscles which I am told is as a result of Prednisone use and not associated with the PMR which is under control. Has anyone else experienced this pain and how long does it last - throughout the weaning process and how long after usage has finished?  Reply:I was prescribed prednisone for PMR also and have been taking it for five (5) years. I too was told to taper off over a years time but the PMR came back with a vengeance, so now I'm bakd to five mg a day and will again try tapering off but I think I will be on it for the rest of my life. I have not had any other side effects to speak of, but others have told me that they have.",4
"100mg 1x day for the last seven weeks, dropping 20mg every two weeks now. If I could rate this a negative I would. Horrible side effects.

"Recently finished Solu-Medrol Iv and moved on to Prednisone oral. 70mg for 2 days, 60 mg etc down to 10mg for 2 days. A little sleepy, hot flashes and sweats. No weight gain because I pay closer attention to my diet while on it.I informed my doctor of EVERY medicine, vitamin and supplement that I take, including otc so I have no fear of adverse reactions. He prescribed me a vitamin d supplement to help prevent bone loss and I feel better than I have in weeks! Not every person will have bad side effects! It varies for everyone. Do your research and talk to your doctor, he doesn't know everything about you!",4
I was taking this medication for my breathing from a bad bronchial infection. The Nurse Practioner didn't tell me that it would raise my glucose level. My regular doctor told me later that it would. And did it ever raise it. I quit taken this med right on the spot. And now I'm having trouble getting my glucose level to come down. ,1

I am half way through and starting to reduce dosage today. Itching is gone but I am nervous, tired, have nausea, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Can't wait to get off!",4
Prednisone is not worth takeing in my oppinion. I personally gained 50lbs and now i have black n blue spots in my legs that only go away when im in a hot tub. Totally not worth takeing.,1

"It started with a cough that he could not get rid of no matter what I gave him and I have given him everything just to get him some releif though the cough was not horrible it was consistant sometimes mucusy other dry coughing and over a 2 month period I have him(claritin,albuteral syrup,dimatapp DM, vaporizor  at bedtime with vicks, he even had aumenten nothing would stop his cough) his behavior was normal he just would cough so his pediatrician called in prednisone and after reading all of these reviews I was worried about giving him this medicine he is only 3 yrs old. But I spoke to the pharmist and a friend that both personally know about this medicine  and gave it a try it helped him it slowed the cough down to almost non existant. I noticed that the coughing came back when he ran outside or if he got really upset then he would go into a coughing fit but once he would rest or calm down he was okay..and no side effects noticed so far today is his last day  which is the 5th day of 1 and 1/2 tsp 2x a day. I hope the cough will not return after has completed his dosage, but so far I think that this medicine helped him he did seem a little sleepy somedays, but that is all I noticed.I know the reviews here are heartbreaking and some are down right scary  , but pray about it speak to your doctor or someone you know personally who has used this medicine before you decide to use it yourself stay infomred..",3
"I have been taking prednisone at least every other month since 1999 when I got Legionaires Disease. Everytime I take it I have a different reaction to it.Once the skin reaction was so bad the dr.s thought I had Lupus. I still have to take this drug eventhou I never know what reaction I will have because it is the only drug that relieves my lung swelling and prevents having to be put on a ventilator for a 3rd time. I suffer thru the side effects because the other options are even worse.Just be careful,even if you have taken a drug before does not mean that you will always react the same everytime. Also it runs your sugar thru the roof everytime you take it so be ready to posswible have to go on insulin during treatment even if you don't have any sugar issues before treatment.For me it is a miracle drug that has saved my life several times.",5

NO THANKS",2
"14 months of prednisone treatment for myopathy caused by auto immune disease. It stopped the progress of the illness, but did not repair the damage.",4
"I am a UC sufferer and I have been on prednisone 3 times now. The first time I had a moderate flare I was put on 35 mg of prednisone and it cleared up within a few days. Great stuff. However, the second time around I had an extreme flare, was hospitalized, and put on 60-70 mg per day and it took me 2 weeks to stabalize. That being said, both times I went into remission - which held the last time for 6 years. So I'm flaring again, for 3 weeks now at a moderate level, and my new doctor has put me on 20 mg per day.   Here is what I've found. This stuff is a miracle drug. But staying on it a long time at high doses is a bad idea. If you don't get relief within a few weeks, seek alternate treatment. You will get moon face, anxious, angry, insomnia, etc...but in my case, the side effects were nothing compared to the problem. Just know that about 30 mg is about right for a moderate flare, and when you start playing in eth 60-70 range you will feel and act somewhat manic. Exercise is key - burn off the energy (and the added weight). Eat protein, maybe replace a meal with a protein drink once every second day, and sleep when you can. I'm also dealing with a newborn at eth same time, so this insomnia isn't a big deal right now. I'm up anyway.  Good luck. My fingers are crossed for us both.",5
my wife was on this drug and i read somwhere you should not take it if your a diebetic. well the dr.s gave it to her anyway and I feel in my heart thats what killed her,1
"Swelling of the face, neck and overall weight gain.",2
"Prednisone has worked dramatically in coordination with other drugs such-as immuno- suppressants and anti-malarial drugs. I just wanted to say that in my experience with the drug a key factor to avoiding a lot of the side effects is to drink A LOT of water. There have been intermittent times that I've had to take as much as 80mgs of it, although I did get a little puffy-faced and bloated it wasn't horrible. I did have lots of mood changes but that was worth it considering before I took it I couldn't get out of bed, take a shower, opening anything was impossible and I needed help eating and changing my clothes. Mind you, I was only 27 at the time of my first flare up and 28 at the second. Both were hell, so I'll deal with the side effects of maybe being a little nutty or maybe in the future needing a hip replacement because right now my quality of life is waaay better. Today for the first time I got a test reading that my sedimentation rate was ZERO...totally awesome.    So, in short, listen to what your body's telling you, eat right, drink lots of water and get rest when you can. Be prepared to be moody and have trouble sleeping for a bit while you adjust. Let others around you know what's going on so you don't seem like you're just acting like a lunatic for no reason.   Ps. There was someone on here talking about fibromyalgia, I would suggest having them do an ANA work up to see if you have Lupus.  ",5

"I had uncontrolled symptoms from RA while pregnant & had to stop my infusion of Remicade.  I tool prednisone for almost a year & a half to help ease symptoms.  It was a terrible experience weening my body off as it would cause a flare up every 1 mg reduction until I was finally off it-took 6 months to get off once i started reducing the dose.  Extreme wait gain, as well. My face swelled up like I had an allergic reaction...but it was constant.  Would HIGHLY recommend not starting unless there is absolutely no alternative.",2

"I'm a very active busy person and my dr prescribed me this medication due to my severe pain in the legs and arms (which may be due to the bruise on my thigh-that wouldn't heal up, it was 14 days old) and swelling of eye lids.  There were days that I couldn't get out of bed or walk, get comfortable in a chair/bed, type or even hold anything in my hands. I have been on this 6 days w/2 more days (40mg/2days, 30mg/2 days, 20mg/2 days and then 10mg/2 days) and I've noticed a little improvement and a couple of side effects (slowed movements, nausea).  I still have the aches and pains but it's eased up a bit that I can actually function, however, at night, I still have to wrap up my legs, arms and body in warm towels for some relief.  The bruise is actually healing faster, too. Hopefully this medication is only short-term for me.   ",3

"I was on 80mg a day. Prednisone worked right away for pain and swelling. However, everything else was terrible. I had almost all of the side effects possible. I became severely depressed. The emotions that I faced on this medication, I would not wish them upon anyone. I stopped going to school, work and out. My face became severely swollen along with my abdomen.  I had night sweats, fatigue, muscle weakness. I became full dependent on the medication, just to get out of bed. I lost 1/2 of the hair on my head. Hair grew along my back, arms, and face; very unappealing for a girl and disheartening.  I gained 15 pounds in the first week. It was the worst drug that I've ever had to take. I would rather be in pain than to ever take this drug again",5

Now my left rib is feeling lots of pain. I have taken pain meds, lots of pain medications and it doesn't touch it. My question is; should I go to the emergancy hospital or wait it out. Will it get worse? I am so very weak. Is this a side effect from getting off the predisone 10mg too quickly?",3

Seems like a good trade for me since I don't realize any internal damage. (Knock on wood) Some weight gain. 8-10 lbs. within the year. Big appetite. Some sleeplessness. Raised blood pressure.(worrisome)Occasional anxiety.Puffy face. I can now labor at work. I play drums 3-4 nights a month in clubs. I can get on an elliptical machine for about 20 minutes. With full symptoms of this illness,I hate even wearing clothes. Burning,itching rashes over 35% of my body. Due to muscle weakness and all around fatigue,it's hard to dry off out of the shower. Shaking hands while trying to comb my hair. Hard to walk up steps. Couldn't get up out of a squat position. Now I'm at least 90% symptom free. Hoping for remission. God Bless and good luck to all suffering.      ",4
"I would say that I was very satisfied with this drug except it made me really mean and hungry lol.  Three years ago, I had to take it for an allergic reaction I had to bactrim while treating a UTI.  I was put on both Prednisone (for 5 days) and Macrobid for the infection and both worked.  Prednisone sure is tough, I will say that.   ",4
"I am a pretty healthy person that gets sinus infections easily so the doc gave me this and the side effects are worse than anything! It actually made me tired for the first few days! Ever since I've been sleeping like a baby at night which is nice because I expected to be up all night. However,I feel like I am trapped inside my skin from the weight gain and that have beeen causing anxiety attacks. Severe headaches that feel like tension headaches. This is the WORST pill I've ever taken. I'd take a sinus infection over this anyday!",1
they put me on such a high dosage 60mg for two weeks then i think they weened me off wrong. I am havivg side effects tied into prednisone.,4
"Have taken this med off and on for nearly 55 years for asthma, acute bronchitis, pneumonia and other pulmonary problems.  Now considering it for back and joint issues due to herniated discs, pinched nerves and arthritis.  Many may have serious issues with it but I took aspirin once in my life and it resulted in anaphylactic shock.",5
"Eight years ago I had sudden blindness in my left eye diagnosed as temporal arteritis and received 80 mgs daily, with a slow reduction of dosage -- later for another illness, received another dosage of 80 mgs daily.  The blindness is still there, and then high blood sugar (diabetes) which gave me neuropathy in my legs and feet.  They are numb, discolored, bruise with a touch, and sting and burn 24 hours a day.  All I can say - it may be good in small doses for some things, but BEWARE of the large doses.  I remain on 5 mgs. daily to this day.",1
"Have been as high as 40, then down to 2.5 per day, then relapsed and back to 40. Takes away PMR pain, but side effects horrible: dizzy, numb, out-of-body feeling. Exhaustion! colonic ulcer, insomnia that has cleared up, moon face, etc. ",5
Prednisone reduces pain but has bad side effects,5
"after months of pain and constant aching in my joints I finally have relief. Its only been two days, it took affect that fast. This drug worked in the past for me in treating allergic reactions and I was hoping it would help with my RA. This is a miracle drug in my book. I don't experience any side effects either.",5
"I have been in chemo for four months taking 100 mg 5 days per week.  Slightly shaky hands, slight blurred vision, sleep problems, albeit minimal.  Overall, I think the drug does what it was intended for .",5
"Had an allergic reaction to ceftin for a sinus infection.  Went to the ER and they gave me Benadryl and solumedryl in IV.  Sent me home on Benadryl and Prednisone.  Was to take the Prednisone for 3 days only - 7ml each day.  Took the first dose and stopped the next day!!!   The following morning woke up unable to breath and with uncrontollable shaking!   Sweats - no fever!   Still after three weeks experiencing weakness, anxiety, fatigue, nausea!   Have a mild case of asthma and is has always been controlled with singulair and zyrtec D.  Alubuterol inhaler only occasionally.  Find I now need it more often!!!  Hoping only the side effects from this one dose will eventually go away!   Nurse practitioner said that she had never heard of such a reaction before!!!!!   Glad to know I am not alone!",1
spontaneous bleeding due to the low platelet count and increased glucose levels.  ended up in the hospital for two weeks with tranfusion of 10 units of blood and 5 units of platelets,2
weightgain helped me breath easier,4
I have had hives for two months that come and go daily. It seems when i am on 20-40 mgs a day they are gone. Usually when i drop to 10 mgs they come back. It is a great drug but i can't stay on it. I have notices I am more hungry and do get heartburn but it beats the hives. ,5
"Love it - hate it! I have been taking prednisone for 7 years for severe rheumatoid arthritis, where my hands were frozen in one position and could barely walk. The side effects are terrible! Mood swings, irritable, weight gain, diabetes, dry skin, ect. However, as bad as it is - and gave me diabetes, I couldn't function without it and the other drugs that I am taking for arthritis. I read an article where even taking it for a short period can turn on the diabetes.",5
This med was used for over a year at a high level and then my specialist wondered how I got it. A student doctor in the hospital had never told me to only take it for a short while and then go off. This eventually caused both my eyes to need operations for cataracts.,1
"I've been taking this medication since 1998,and I don't like all of the side-affects.Currently looking for a different medication to better suite me. ",4
got extreme bone/muscle pain on the same day of first dose,1
"I posted before in October, one month into having Bell's Palsy. Now, it's December and I STILL have it. I've been on Prednisone the whole time and it really does look as tho' I've eaten my neighbor. I am amazed at the weight gain. Everyone said that the Bell's would be gone after two months if taking Prednisone, but everyone must not include me. I have seriosly gained 85 lbs and I can barely walk. I have also had to have my eye sewn shut twice because it drooped so badly and the bolsters(something like stitches) came undone the first time and my eye Doc had to do the procedure again. But I am more concerned about how to get the extreme weight off if this plague ever ends. Right now, I'd just prefer death. Anything would be better than this.",1
"Since going on this I have experienced at least 1/2 of the most severe side effects.  The myalgia is excruciating, the weight gain (I had just lost 20lbs) was extreme.  I can't stop eating, my heart is racing, the mood swings are severe.  I've been off for 3 days after weaning from a 60mg/day dose and I am anxiously waiting for it to ""get out of my system"".  Never again!! I'd rather stay in the hospital!",3
Just the little time that I have been on it I have noticed a change. If i miss a day I can tell. Flare up happen and fatigue also...,3
"Was given prednisone to control recurring severe asthma. It usually helps to make it easier to breathe and I usually am on for short periods of time. Recently however I have been on prednisone for weeks and still have shortness of breath - I have Post-Polio which has weakened my diaphragm muscles for breathing. The negatives are the side effects. Coming off of prednisone I get severe muscle cramps. While on the drug I feel very hyper, jumpy, trouble sleeping, muscle twitches and mood swings. Also feel like heart is racing. I need to take this along with a plethora of other meds for breathing. But if it were not a life-threatening situation I would stop because of the side effects.",3
"I was diagnosed mixed connective tissue disease 11 month ago. Now I took 1 mg prednisone a day. My blood test is fine. I see Dr. {RA specialist} every three month. I also take plaquenil 200mg every day. By the way, I also take heigh blood pressure pills.",5
"The medicine stopped the pain but it was the worse medicine I have ever taken. I was 20 when I started to take it and had almost every side effect possible. I gained weight, lost massive amounts of hair on my head but hair everywhere else was lost and then grew back in patches of thick hair, severe depression,trouble sleeping, headaches, ""moon face"", and much more. I couldn't handle the side effects. I stopped going to school and work. I kept to myself and away from friends. Once I was off the medicine, I started to loose the weight, gain hair back, puffiness went away, I got out of depression. I would rather be in pain again than take this medicine again",4
Gain to much weight It really do help with breathing. It  also help my joint pain. plus keep my skin clear.,5
"I have been on and off prednisone for over 6 months for flare ups of RA.I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR 2 WEEKS FOR A COLLAPSED LUNG AND HAVE NOW LEARNED THE RA IS AFFECTING MY LUNGS.I HAVE SEVERE STRETCH MARKS,TREMORS AND VISION PROBLEMS BUT I CANNOT WEAN OFF   YET BECAUSE I FEEL WORSE WHEN I DO AND HAVE A RELAPSE IN JOINT PAIN AND DIFFICULTY BREATHING.",4
Worked like a miracle.,5
"When I have a flare up, the prednisone helps the swelling and inflamation and makes the pain go away. But it does swells my face up like a balloon!",4
"After 8 months and tapering off for PMR, I am extremely stiff with painful muscles which I am told is as a result of Prednisone use and not associated with the PMR which is under control. Has anyone else experienced this pain and how long does it last - throughout the weaning process and how long after usage has finished?",4
prednisone seemed to work perfectly on the temporal arteritis.  However the side effects of the steroid were unpleasant. I am now off of the steroid and the arteritis seems to be gone. stopped steroid last week.,5
"Was on 30mg for two months for Crohns. When syptoms subsided, taperd down 5mg per week. At 5mg developed rash,leg cramps, severe headache, vomiting some swelling in face. Doctor did not think it was prednisone. Was given CT scan. NO diagnoses. NO Help or advise for headache or cramps. I feel it is due to predisone. ",5
Deep depression and no noticeable affect on my pneumonia or my breathing. I am a diabetic and I was not warned of any adverse affects by the emergency dept. doc.He also prescribed avelox which exacerbated my symptons.,1
"This made me very irratible, I could not sleep but was always tired, it gave me fake diabetes while i was on it and it also gave me a stomach ulcer which bled and I lost half my blood and almost died.  I hate this drug and would only take it again if I absoultly had to.",5
"While it is true that steroids have literally saved my life, they have also done irreparable harm to my hip joints. In 2000 and 2001 I had first the right and then the left hip replaced for avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. When you take steroids for any length of time, fat clots can form in your bloodstream and clog up the small arteries feeding the ends of bones, such as the head of the femur in my case. This causes the bone to die and then collapse in on itself, causing excruciating pain and disability. I was in a wheelchair for five years and was bedridden for most of that time, because it was too painful to sit or walk for any length of time. Because of having AVN my doctors are now leery of prescribing steroids for my lupus.",4
"increased s.o.b with a productive cough, increased stomach pain nausea. and pain in my calf.",1
Spine problems and pain.  ,4
"I was given prednisone by a ENT physician to alleviate extreme neck swelling and fatigue. The routine started at 40mg and declined to 10 mg over two weeks. The swelling and fatigue reduced on the first day. I was glad when the dose declined to 20mg to eliminate jitters and sleepless side effects. Last week I had my first chemo treatment after being referred to and diagnosed by an oncologist. A prescription of 100mg prednisone for 5 days was part of the first treatment. I quit taking it after 3 days because my vision began to blur at that dose level. The oncologist will reduce the amount at the next chemo treatment (I hope). My eyesight has not returned to normal one week after stopping but I think it's getting better. My optometrist dilated and checked my eyes, the vitreous fluid in one eye is slightly cloudy. I gave a neutral rating because this drug can have positive and negative effects. In my experience, beware doses larger than 40mg/day even for short term.",3
"My sinuses were congested severely,until 1 day after taking the medication.Now I can breathe well.My condition is likely to return after finishing the medication.",5
had a bad cough it left when i stopped taking the med it return worse,3
My doc prescribed this due to my immune system attacking my muscles. Started to the drug about 2 weeks ago and I am able to walk and somewhat function again. I have also had 3 infusions of steriods to build my muscles back up. So far I have no side effects other than headaches my pain and weakness has dramatically improved. ,4
"The side effects are simply not worth it. It makes me anxious, depressed, foggy. I've been unable to work or care for my children.  It initially brings my platelets up to a more manageable level, but doesn't work long term and is not worth the awful side effects. It is going to take me 5 weeks to taper off safely.  I will not take it again.",2
"I don't feel this medication has helped my pain, especially in my lower back. My doctor says I have Fibromyalgia Rheumatica and I have to keep taking prednisone but I am afraid of this type of treatment.  I have tried adding Methetrexate once weekly but I couldn't see where it made any difference. So I quit taking it.",2
"I have been on 3 round of Prednisone with Naproxin and Percocet for swelling in my knees and ankles.  After I complete a round of Prednisone, within 5 to 7 days, the swelling returns to those joints.  Not sure what we're gonna do after this round tho.  The side effects for me are sleeplessness, dizzyness, and I'm spacey for a few hours after I take it.  However my personal benefits far out weigh the side effects.  ",5
"I have been on/off Prednisone for 2 years ever sence I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis.  The drug does work extreamly weel.  Taking care of the flair up within a week or less.  I also take Asacol and Remicade.  Asacol will not work on its own and Remicade seems worthless.  Predinose does do the job however I have had the following side effects.  Moon face, weight gain, erritability, easily angered and my hands will shake.  Also if I am on more then 20 mg for a prolonged period of time I have blurry vision in one eye on/off durring the day.  So far that has gone way once the dose goes down.  I am currently on 25 mg a day working to get off completely.  Once off I do not plan on going on it again but for sure not above the 20 mg I seem to be ok with.  It does do the job I have to say that but the long term side effects may not out weight the damage to your nervouse system.  Always consult your doc. and remeber you know yourself better then anyone.   ",5

"I was prescribed methylprednisolone(prednisone) two weeks ago due to hives and itchy skin, during taking the medication nothing changed, I was still scratching, only I couldn't sleep! Was taking benadryl as well as prescribed from a doctor and I'm 2 pills shy of taking over 48 pills in the past two weeks! I keep calling the pharmacy and they say the pills should ""kick in"" soon, although I'm done with the 6 day prescription plan.  I can't breath, I'm constantly having coughing fits which is hurting my head giving me a fever,  and then causing my skin to hive up to itch..all keeping me up at night! Nothing good has came out of this medication for me, and I don't recommend anyone taking it! ",2
"I am a 55y/o male put on predisone to treat an unknown cause of anemia, in which my red cells are being destroyed by an unknown source in my body. the downside of this med in my case iselevated  blood sugar, bloating in face and restleness. Other than that it is pretty effective.",4
Started @ 80mg=HIGH AS A KITE....GAINED 20 LBS a MONTH the 1st 4 months and the last 20 crept up until I got it lowered to 10MG!!! I've gotten 60 LBS off but the other 40 are CHILLIN!!! Other than the weight gain....This is a MIRICLE DRUG!!! I miss 1 dose and i'm bed ridden! Been on it for 2 years now!,5
i was having extreme trouble breathing and my inhaler wasn't giving me enough relief. I couldn't stop coughing.  I went to see my doctor and they prescribed prednisone which seem to work instantly.  I am relieved and it didn't take long.  thank you for your help.,5
"At higher doses (60mgs,) I notice I am a bit jumpy, or irritable, crabby, as the dose is decreased this goes away.",5

Had shingles on ny head.  Drug really helped in swelling.,5
I've been on it twice in the last month for asthma I also have bronchitis. The first time it took a few days and my cough went away but after 2 days it came back and is much worse. I was told it will go away in one day but it is still about the same. First time it hasn't worked for me.,3
this medication really works but it is fallowed with side effects.  I have to deal with it  I'm still here today  11/04/2010  Tom,4
"I was prescibed this med on 11/01/10 for a allergic reaction to some antibotics. I developed a severe rash all over my body, and it itched really bad, and was red all over. I was prescribed a 5 day dosage of 20 mg, taking 1 a day. I have only taken prednisone for 1 day and i did not get ANY sleep last night. I'm exhausted this morning. The rash appears to be leaving, but I'm itching so bad, that I just want to peel my skin off. I took a dose this morning to see if the rash clears completely today and I'm stopping the meds if it does.  The side affects are too severe for me.  I am really concern about about the weight gain and the sleeplessness.  One of my co-workers just walked in and said my face was swollen.  This medicine is not good.",5
"My doc gave me these meds because i had a deep cough/mucus build up for several months.  I was only on a 7 day dose, within a couple hours of taking the drug my cough was gone but the side effects were TERRIBLE!!  Insomnia, RAPID heart rate (140-180 bpm), tightness in chest,  SEVERE anxiety, mood swings, blurry vision, shakiness, headaches, low blood sugar, i lost 10 lbs (putting me at 100lbs) & nausea!  I had to take 2 trips to the E.R due to my heart rate. The side effects where very active for several weeks after taking the drug, to my understanding even after the drug is out of your system it can take time for your body to adjust depending on your dose and body/weight. And now i am on a different medication (atenolol, beta blockers) for my heart rate which is now causing me to have low blood pressure and other severe side effects.  :(  THIS MEDICATION WAS HORRIBLE AND I ADVICE NO ONE TO TAKE IT UNLESS YOU FEEL IT IS NECESSARY. I would also like to mention i nor my doctor's made the correlation with my symptoms to the prednisone untill i did my OWN research online and found many similar cases. i was terrified through this experience and really felt like i was near death.   I did not have any of these problems before the medication but the doctors kept on insisting its all anxiety and what not.  I was put on zoloft, beta blockers, xanax and antibiotics all because of side effects of this medication.  You can only trust yourself, i strongly advice to do your own research! I hope this helps anyone out there going through a similar experience. I am in pharmaceutical hell now because of this drug!!",4

I guess most of the bad side effects are what i am experiencing. I do not like this medicine and will never take it again. Oh and the mood swings are terrible. I will finish the two weeks but will never go on another steroid again. Yuck! Make sure it is absolutely necessary for you to go on this drug before saying yes.",3

"I was given this drug to help treat Pneumonia. Within hours of starting this drug I had almost complete ability to breathe again. Its helping me cough out what I need to. Only side effects I have noticed are not able to sleep much at night, hot flashes (Im only 26) and I have MAJOR munchies! I think a losing a little bit of sleep is a small price to pay for oxygen in my lungs! On a side note, I also suffer from Trigeminal Neuralgia and have noticed a decrease in pain after starting this medication.",5
"62 year old male--Great drug for Crohns disease--long term use is not good, but alternative drugs and surgery are worse. Just spent 6 days in hospital for small bowel obstruction.

"I was on two different types of inhaler plus some liquid taken through a nebulizer. My breathing, or lack of, just kept getting worse. My doctor suggested 10mg oral prednisone every other day and I started  doing better but still not where I wanted to be. After walking thirty steps I would gasp for breath. I finally just said to heck with it and stopped all inhaler treatment. I am an 86 year old male and can breath better, excercise more and feel better than I have in years. So many people have warned me about this medication and all it can do to harm me. It may not be for everyone but for the past 4-5 years it has worked wonders for me. ",5

"I have read many of the reviews and most seem to be so negative...I have gone to the DR over and over and been given pain pills, muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory.  Theses have given me mild relief but NEVER the relief that this has.  After just the second dose I was able to move better then I had in over 15 YEARS!!  I could get out of bed with no problem at all, in the last 3 weeks it had been taking me up to 2 hour just to get out of bed!!  I came walk pain-free and can actually make it through the day and still have energy when I get home from work.  I am not always tired and wore out like I use to be all the time.  I was worried about weight-gain, being that I am over weight as it is, but having the energy now I have actually lost weight. I am sure that this medication is not for everyone, but keep in mind that it does help some people.  Trust your DR, and never forget to tell them what other medications you are currently taking. Don't forget to ask them if there are over the counter medications that you should avoid taking too. If it works for you like it has for me, you will be VERY HAPPY that you decided to give it a try!   ",5
It made me extremely anxious and near panic. I began to tapper off after only 1 day of treatment. Have taken other Steriod med in the past with minor side effects.,1

I took prednisone for Reactive Airway Disease- an asthma-like condition due to a chemical exposure. I did not have any terrible side effects like some people have described.

Very swollen and painful. I was  unable to walk without crutches. Life was pure hell. Crawling around on all fours.My DR. prescribed Prednisone 10 mg,over a week, 30 tablets. After a week foot returned to nearly normal size but still painful. Reduce Predisone to twice daily as of now. I am fully active now and getting more exercise and feel great. Suffered NONE of the bad symtoms associated with this med. I am concerned with the long term effects of said drug.

The skin on my feet, which is where my rash was, was getting real thick and red and irritated. It has really helped my skin get back to normal. The only side effect I have experienced is a big increase in appetite. It really makes me hungry. But, I have bumped up my workout a little more to compensate, and have actually lost 2 lbs while on this medicine, despite my increase in appetite. ",5
"OMG as they say. Given for asthma flaired up from a cold. I also am battling hip pain from arhtritis. Hip replacement in December. It is clearing up the astma problem quickly and really doing a much better job on the hip pain than the hydrocodone.

It is great stuff, if you don't have a placebo problem I don't think you will have the imagined problems mentioned.",5

Usually I feel better within a week, but this time the bronchitis is so severe, I still am having breathing trouble, albeit, not as extreme.

"I took this medication for a weather related skin allergy. First time I have ever had this. On the llth day I was taken to the hospital by ambulance, as I thought I was having a heart attack. Did nuclear stress test and heart was fine. They say acid reflux, which I have never had, and the medication is a possible cause of this bad reaction I had. Will never take again.

"This is my second go around with Bell's Palsy.Last time was in '68 and treated with Penicillin. Now, treating with Valtrex and Prednisone. One month in and no change. But the Prednisone makes me want to eat my neighbors. I stay hungry and have gained 28 lbs. Lots of energy tho'. No sleep. Doc has me on 10mg 4 times daily. I think it's overkill, but I'm following orders. I can't imagine what I would do if it lasted six months like it did the first time. I'll weigh 300 lbs. and will probably start robbing banks during my sleepless nights!",1
This medication worked very well on my hip and pelvic pain but I had mood swings and get up set for no real reason I did not like the way it made me feel that way But I only had to use it for 14 days so I just tryed to control myself and try to stay out of peoples way,5
I was given prednisone to help control asthma for which it worked really well It also gave me quick relief from back pain caused by a ruptured disc in my lower back I now use it to great effect when my basck and leg start hurting ,5
"I have only been on Prednisone for 2 weeks, this medication has worked wonders for me, I am able to do all the tgings I enjoy again, I can take long walks I can pick things up when I drop them without thinking about who is watching me barely able to stand up straight, I am so very pleased with my progress, and so far I have not exprienced any of the side effects.",5
Corticosteriod induced mania!!  Be careful,5

"I was put on this medication for an unknown allergy. However, I am not experiencing extreme anxiety, sleeplessness, lack of any form of sensation of hunger, and depression.  So I'm no longer itching, but have a whole host of other symptoms going on right now.  It has pretty much evened out.",4
"I've taken oral Prednisone series (5 days)two times for severe eczema. The results were immediate. Too bad it can't be taken very much. Had interesting side effects both times: ephoria during, depression for a couple days when complete and a backlash rash a week afterwards. All were warned by dr so I looked out for it.",5

"Had been sick with diagnosed CFS for yrs. was put on predisone for other reason inwithin 3 days felt my strength come back was feeling very good but meant nothing to doctor and now back to feeling horrible, puts me on other meds,just one notable side affect from new med...sudden death... After dealing with doctors this makes perfect sense.",5
"none of the conditions here were the reason I was given Prednisone this time. I knew that I didn't want to take us because I had a series of infections from taking it before, some of them fungal so I told my doctor. He wanted me to take it for an ear inflammation. so I did. Well I became confused started havingheadaches, then mood swings, depression, euphoria, talking to my self, my mind went crazy, I hated everyone, crying, panic attack I take Effexsor XL, and Remeron, Gabipentin, Zocor, Klonapin at night, Midrin, prn. Lexapro  also prn, and doctor gave me Dipluken before the attack",1
"The time I had a severe reaction was around the first of 2010. I was given it for knee pain. The day I started on it, I had a T of 99.4 for which the nurse noted it on my chart. But I was given it anyway, then I started with night sweats and very frequent urination. My T rose to 102. I was given an antibiotic, then I started this white tongue,( thrush ) then canker sores, then blisters on my lips, tongue, and inside cheeks. Of course, I could barely swallow anything. I had sweats especially while trying to sleep. I lost 10 lbs. in 5 days. I didn't take the last 2 Prednisone in the declining dose pak. I recovered in about a week but I am still having a few canker sores.",1
"Yesterday I was given this drug (1oo mg.) prior to  an  infusion of Rituxan ,Cytoxan,and Vineristine I checked my sugar level when i returned home it was 534. Could Prednisone raise my sugar from 98 to 534? the procedure took 7 hours. Please respond  thanks   ",4
"While temporarily on large dosage had several mental changes, including paranoia and rapid, uncontrollable, mood swings. Psychological side effects are much more common than noted in warnings. Noted similar effects in both wife and mother when they were treated for cancer and took prednisone.",5

"I was prescribed 30 mg a day along with 20 mg of Methotrexate a week to treat Dermotomysitis, diagnosed with over 2yrs ago. I have experienced all of the side affects, mood swings, weight gain, sleeplessness, hot and cold flashes, but I regained most of my muscle strenghth. I have been on both meds for over two years.. Was off of the metrotrexate when I got pregnant, and muscles were tight and strenghth was very week. Just started back on it a 2 weeks ago because the rash came back as well, so hopefully soon the rash will subside, and I can get some sleep. Not in any pain though. Predisone works with the Methotrexate for me. ",3
I am just starting this medication.  Less than a week.,1
"I've taken Pred for 20+ years to prevent myself the ravaging of Rheumatoid Arthritis. I was unaware of side-effects until withdrawal was too dangerous because of Adrenal insufficiency (was hospitalized for Addison's Crisis).   Pros: Higher quality of life (for awhile); less pain and inflammation; able to work for 9 additional years.  Cons:  Muscle pain and weakness too severe to walk; disabling fatigue, perspiration, blood sugar and orthostatic complications; almost faint with exertion.  Still hoping to withdraw (with help from Mayo Clinic next month). ",5
no side effects i know of,5
Suffer from night sweats,3
"Definitely helped with swelling pains. Side effect is weight gain,and quickly!",4
"Lupus,RA,Fybro...etc. Chronic pain flares. This has been fantastic for me. Though there are times of bloating,being hungry,restlessness at times and several others minor issues, they all go away. In the long run, this has helped me feel better, have some energy, ease some of the pain and ease things for a time. I've had to take them in the past ever two to three months. None it's been less and have had spinal injections as well. I don't think I would do so well without this drug. I'm most gratiful.",5
I was put on this and it was really working but they wont give it to me anymore cause they say this pill is to strong for me to take all the time. So now im having all my problems again. Can they give me the pills again or is it true that they cant?,5
"I.VE ONLY BEEN USEING IT FOR 2WKS, WHATE A DIFERANCE.",4
"I had immediate relief from my pain within a couple of days.  I started to gain weight around 6-7 weeks. Puffiness was better than all that pain tho!!! My dosage began with 60mg for 6 weeks and I am down to 15mg, soon to be 10mg.I have dieted and taken off 6 lbs the last month.  The doctors say I should be fully cured at the end of my treatment.",5

"Too many side affects,,,horrible!",3
"I'm on my 4th day for severe allergies and I HATE IT. I feel the need to cry at least twice a day, every day. I had to leave class yesterday to do so.Then my face is swollen and numb now. I also am extremely hungry all the time and I'm having weird muscle pain. Like my hands are always cramping, and I get these weird vibrations all over. I also feel lightheaded and have horrible headaches.  My vision blurs quite a bit while on this stuff and I get hot and irritated a few times a day.Then I get occasional chest pains now, but after a good burp it is relieved. I hate this steroid but I will admit my allergies have leveled out a bit. But if possible, try to find a another drug. This one makes me seem pregnant & I'm not sure the side-effects are quite worth it.  Oh and I'm 16, and on this for 7 days. 7 the first, then 6, and so on.",4
"i was only on this med for 4 days this time around but i never felt worse. i cant sleep,my heart is racing, and my chest is hurting. i've been on this before but i never had this reaction before likie this. i will never take this again by choice",3
"on predisone for six months extreme weight gain whilst on them, muscle spasms and ache all over after coming off them great tablet for my condition but after effects are terrible",5
"omg!I will never ever again take this.I had swelling of my glands from a virus,yes the swelling went down however I never felt so sick dizziness ,nausea,heart racing & headache for which you are not suppossed to take ibuprofen or aspirin with this so I`m stuck.Then you have to slowly wean yourself off and feel sick during that and are more prone to ilness & infection while taking I would`ve rather been sick an additional month  than this.Also there are too manyside effects.",2
"  I was on prednisone for over 20 years...a dose ranging between 5 and 12.5 mg.    Re: satisfaction, I'm in the middle. Prednisone was amazingly effective to calm the inflamation and swelling of Rheumatoid Arthritis, but the long-term effects have been devastating.  The Pros:   1). Prednisone added some years of quality to my life; I wouldn't have had it, otherwise.    2). I was able to continue my job as a public school classroom teacher.  The Cons:   1). Now in my 60's, my leg and arm muscles have weakened to the point that I'm nearly helpless.  I'm 5' 3"" and weigh 118 lbs, but my legs can barely support my weight. I'm able to walk to the garage, but must rest before returning to the house. I must rest after walking up the stairs (13 steps).   2). I suffer from severe perspiration, over-heating, fatigue and shortness of breath. Organ disease has been ruled out by specialists. Getting dressed is all I can accomplish in a day.    Withdrawal has been an enormous problem. I've attempted it several times, but landed in the hospital with an Addison's Crisis.   I am scheduled for a visit to Mayo...I need hope, and advice on how to proceed!   I believe that only God can deliver me from the years of daily prednisone use. ",5
I was prescribed Prednisone because of inflamation from arthritic pain in my back and hip joints. A blood test showed the severity of inflamation. After taking Prednisone for only a few days I noticed a definite difference in my comfort level. I gradually decreased the dosage and have maintained that comfort level as shown in recent blood work results.   My only annoying side effect is an increase in appetite and subsequent weight gain. ,4
"Prednisone is a life saving drug.  It is also a drug that can make life hardly worth living.  Suggestions: If you don't need this drug, don't take it. Make your decisions with your doctor who you trust.  If you don't have a doctor you trust, FIND ONE!!  Do your own research and lots of it.  Weigh the pros and cons of prednisone use based on your confirmed diagnosis. And in the end..... The decisions must be your own.",5
"HORRIBLE!  This med caused my heart to race, blood pressure up, sugar up, dizziness, numbness, tingling, tightness in chest, difficulty breathing, etc.  I am now scheduled to see a Cardiologist and I've NEVER had heart trouble until now.  Moon face, retaining fluid, feel HORRIBLE!  Fluid in chest, headaches, weight gain.  I have been off of the meds for over 2 weeks and I am STILL having problems.  PLEASE make sure it is MEDICALLY NECESSARY BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICINE.  Joint pain and tenderness, NO SLEEPING, HUNGRY!  I cannot STRESS enough how BAD it has been for me.",1
"I was given prednisone to treat buzzing and ringing in one ear as well as significant hearing loss due to noise exposure. Treatment started less than 24 hrs. after the exposure. The ringinging was gone in 2 days and my hearing tested normal 1 week later. I am very grateful. What's more, my chronic neck and back pain have been reduced so much I feel 10 years younger.(I'm 49 but have been having back problems for a while) I just took my last prescribed dose and will miss it. I did experience vertigo but I have had vertigo before and am not sure that it is a result of the drug.",5
" Iam diabetic with CHF  who suffered an asthma attack making very difficult to breath.Prednisone improved my breathing with the first dose,but my blood sugar increased a lot(500). also my blood pressure presure was very high and have terrible headache all day.I am afraid to continue the five days treatment recommended since I am at high risk of stroke ",3
"10 mg. daily were perscribed to treat PMR.  The extreme pain was almost gone in 3 days but I was told to stay on it as it can take 12 to 18 months to cure.  I was on it for 3 months and experienced sleeplessness, anxiety, depression. facial swelling, tongue swelling, weight gain bloating, headaches, sore throat, rapid heartbeat.  I had to stop it gradually, 1 mg. every 2 weeks.  Never felt so awful and can't wait to get it all out of my system. Never again!",5
The taste was unbearable but over all it really helped with the sympthoms,4
"This medication SAVED MY LIFE! From anaphylaxis, or severe, life-threatening allergic reactions in which my body basically attacked itself in its desire to rid itself of some 'unknown' offender... I had idiopathic anaphylaxis, cause unknown, although possibly caused by reaction to drug, Depakote, not determined.  The SIDE EFFECTS of long-term, and high MG use of Prednisone have been mild/annoying, to 'extreme, and at times, debilitating' in many ways.. However, compared to the alternative of death, within 10 minutes or so, it has been a miracle, and I thank God for it! It has been the 1 thing which has allowed me to maintain a level of security and management with my anaphylaxis. Yay, prednisone~!!!",5

"I was prescribed this medication by my VA clinic doctor because she assumed the pain in my shoulder was caused by gout. After taking this medication with no result an MRI showed I have a bone spur in my rotater cuff. But, since taking medication, I now have osteoporosis, so I don't have to worry about the shoulder pain no more because the back pain makes me forget all about the shoulder pain.",1
"While the medication did a great job on my severe joint inflamation, there were just too many side effects for me to keep taking it. I got the ""moon face"", became manic, became extremely angry and didn't sleep at all!",4
I used this drug because of a reaction to levaquin. I blew out all of the blood vessals in both of my eyes.  The drug helped my symptoms but I couldnt sleep.  on the average i got about 3 hours of sleep a night for 2 weeks.  I was very hyper and couldnt stop eating.  I hope I never have to take that again.,3
Been on this med at tapered doses for about 3 weeks and will continue for 2 more. My vasculitis rash has completely cleared. This is the first time in two years! The first week had an upset stomach almost every day but that stoped when my daily dose went down. Now I just have ocassional  water retention and have gained about 6 pounds. The side effects are worth the results for me! ,5
"I was put on predisone for an allergic reaction which caused an outbreak of bumps all over my body. Predisone really cleared up the problem around 3 days.

"I hated the medicine, but I loved that it worked so well.  This was prescribed to me to treat a severe case of poison ivy as a 12 day regiment starting with 60 mg a day tapering to 5mg to end.  It did work almost immediately.  The first day I took it I slept for the first time in 2 days because I wasn't in pain and itching from the rash.  But that was the last time I slept.  It did keep me up.  It gave me a sort of foggy boundless energy.  Then as I tapered off, the sadness, the mood swings, stomach pain, nausea, diareaha, headaches, extreme fatigue and anxiety set in.  I literally thought I was dying because I was having all these things at once.  I felt like a crazy woman.  I had to keep in my mind that it was the medicine and I think that thought alone got me through.  I have been off the medicine for 3 days now and I am still feeling ""funny"".  It a matter of seconds I will go from feeling fine to being so exhausted I have to lay down.  My stomach is still very upset.  I have severe gas pains and loose stools.  There are times at night that I feel utterly exhausted but wired.  I am hoping that this will go away as the medicine gets out of my system once and for all.  I am hoping I never have to take it again because I just don't feel myself even after being off of the medicine for a few days now.  I can honestly say that while the poison ivy was awful, the medicine to treat it wasn't much better.  While it worked excellent to treat the problem, I don't know whether it was worth it considering how I feel right now.",5
"I was diagnosed with poison ivy. I had a really bad case. My internest gave me Prednisone 60mg x3days  40mg x3days and 20mg x3days. The only side effect for me was horrible irritability and grouchiness. I also was very emotional. But I knew the why, so it made it a little easier to deal with. But my family wanted to kill me! The med did work though!",4
I have pretty much been on prednisone for 9 months for severe asthma both oral and IV; I have horrible side effects; mainly mood swings; hot flashes; nausea; extreme fatigue (I know its different most are hyper); weight gain especially in the face (which is also weird because I hardly eat on the medication) and severe joint pain. However it allows me to breath and live somewhat of a normal life with many restrictions so I will say the risk outweighs the benefits; however I do recommend if on for a long time to take calcium with it to help prevent bone break down,5
dont like what it is doing to my life or body i dont even look like me ihate it,3
"Reduced swelling of lymph nodes, no side effects while on the medication (24 days). Are there any side effects that have occured after stopping the medication?",5
"I found that the drug which my doctor prescribed for 12 days would ease the itching tremendously, the bumps went away but the itching did not leave completely.  ",4
i seem to have gained weight but this may be from inactivity as well  due to asthma and no longer working. also seem to have some mild depression but this is handled by prozac pretty well . seems to have affected eyesight somewhat detrimentally ,4
"I suffered a severe and painful allergic reaction to Latex about two years ago.  I had initially been prescribed a cortisteroid cream but my skin was way too reactive and the cream made the situation worse. So my FNP prescribed prednisone. Let me tell you, it was quite the rollercoaster ride. In addition to the severe mood swing (screaming at the top of my lungs and then crying two seconds later), my immune system being compromised and lovely blood sugar level of 139, I would almost say it was worth it. However, the compromised immune system caused four MRSA infected boils to turn up on the same day, in addition to some random seeping sores around my bikini line. My spiked blood glucose levels in my blood and urine (and lovely emotional outburst in the Emergency room) caused me to be under observation for Diabetes. Mind you, the boils, open sores and spiked sugar levels were all at the same time and in the same visit. So, you can imagine the slight hysteria I was in. However, I was grateful to be rid of the contact dermitis, which was on my vulva and prevented me from sitting, walking, standing etc etc. I will say this, the Prednisone made my life interesting for a month. ",5
"I have used prednisone countless times to treat exacerbation of my asthma symptoms. It is very effective in in easing my breathing difficulty, but the side effects, especially sleeplessness, mood swings and increased appetite, are a bit annoying.

"I have been feeling very sluggish since taking the last dose, 2 days ago.",3
"I was prescribed a short course of 50 mg for 5 days for lower back spasms related to a degenerative disk. Felt ""high"" the entire 5 days, but back pain went away by day 2. However, no taper, and so far, 2 days after going off the drug, I feel severe withdrawal symptoms--dizziness, severe nausea, impaired appetitite, basically, like I've been poisoned. Not sure if the drug or an impromptu trigger point session actually relieved the pain, but I'm not sure I want to try taking this drug again.",4
"I was diagosed with UC 30years ago, have taken pred off & on for years for flare-ups. This time didnt work so well. I do experience the moon face and weight gain of about 16 lbs. My doctor has suggested using Remicade at this time.",4
"I have been taking prednisone for 5 years, currently at 15mg. I have a rare disorder called Churg-Strauss syndrome which is fatal without the steroid, so it has kept me alive. The side effects I have are glaucoma, massive abdominal weight gain, osteopenia, elevated BP and thinning of the skin.",5
"After a 6 week long bout of pleurisy, my doctor prescribed a fairly short (2 week long) Prednisone taper. The excruciating pain I had in my chest went almost entirely away within hours of taking my first dose. Aside from a little heaviness that I've had with the pleurisy, I feel great and I'm about a week in to the taper. I haven't experienced any side effects except for a little bit of a balance issue in the hour or so after I first took it. I also have a ton of energy, but that could just be because I'm not in terrible pain and am able to handle things like doing laundry and mopping the kitchen floor. After reading so many negative reviews, I was a little anxious to try Prednisone, but I am so thankful I did! ",5

"Initially opthamologist perscribed 20 mg of prednisone 3 times a day to treat temperal arteritis.

After 12 days on 60 mg was reduced to 40mg a day for 9 days then reduced to 20 mg which I'm still taking. At 20mg dose have different side effects.  Now am fatiqued and tired after I take the pill for three to five hours.  ",4

This is an amazing drug. I was having severe sciatica which was effecting my left hip. Now there is no pain at all and I can sleep on my left side again.

Two weeks later drier meats (pork and beef) were quite palatable.  Prednisone did make me thirsty, produced swollen feet and ankles, more muscle weakness (walkin a little unsteady, but two miles is no problem with some pretty good grade involved.  Some difficulty lifting left leg as in climbing stairs.  Using Prednisone less then one month and have all ready been able to cut dosage in half as well as eliminating 40% dosage of mestinone.  Blood sugar has increased substantially but is controlable and insulin not needed as yet.  Blood pressure reduced substantilly allowing one med to be eliminated (Nifedica).

I'm a 22 year old female who was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis.

"Suffering from poison ivy that I touched a week ago while weeding.  While the rash was coming out for the first few days, I slathered on the calamine lotion and ivy dry.  In combination, they helped numb my skin for a few hours at a time.  Repeated in greater frequency multiple times a day as the days went by and the blisters formed and lines of rashes swelled and oozed.  After a week with more blisters still coming out, I went to the doctor for some relief.  I took 40mg of prednisone today and I am popping out of my skin.  It is 4 am and I cannot sleep.  I have about 2 hours before my 2 year old gets up ready for her day.  So I'm not sleeping, my legs feel very crampy, and I'm stressed about taking the next 2 weeks of dosing.  In addition, it made me feel very wound up today, on edge for no reason.  This med seems to be helping with the swelling, but I still had to slather on the calamine tonight.  Even took Benadryl to try and get some relief and/or sleep, to no avail.  I am not enjoying my experience with this drug on day 1, even while I am grateful for some relief from itching of the poison ivy.  Can't comment yet on being hungrier than usual, but so far, I am not enjoying how I feel at all!",4

This medication does help with breathing! It is a miracle drug if you are using it to help with lung function.  The side effects are killing me.  Severe anxiety, sleeplessness (although I am exhaused). I am having to take Ativan 3 times a day to keep things together. One good thing is I am constantly cleaning my house and doing laundry- keeping busy seems to help.  I am on so many other drugs right now I don't know if this is a side effect of drug, but I am sweating non-stop.  I don't want to scare anyone, but please be aware that if you existing anxiety issues, talk to your Dr. about your options. ",5

"Severe case poison ivy.  Recently overcame severe anxiety disorder with very small doses of xanax (a 9-month period).  My body cannot tolerate medications. So Doctor gave me the Prednisone Pack - 4mg pill, for 6 days... starting with 6 pills thru-out the first day, 5 second day and so on.  I am on my 3rd day.  Even tho they are only 4 mg per dose thru-out the day, I have severe side effects. Major increase in heart rate/palpitations.  Trouble breathing due to the heart side effect. Minor chest pain.  Sometimes nausea/stomach upset.  NOW this is only 4mg per dose... My doctor said to start taking the xanax along with the Prednisone to ease the side effects, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  This is scary since I just learned to conrolled my severe anxiety disorder without needing any xanax at all- drug free.  I cant wait to get off this Prednisone. I am debating whether to ask Doc if I can even cut the 4mg in half starting tomorrow.  They say its like an anibiotic, you have to keep w the dosage until its complete :-(  This has given me relief to poison ivy, rash and blisters went away in one day but still have minor itching.",4

"I also have emphysma, it is a good short term drug, I wish there was another, prednisone is not good used as a long lerm drug, thats my opinion. It helps but after I stop taking it for several months my systoms are back and my breathing is bad, then my doc puts me on this drug, it is a great med. but there are so many side effects. I am no longer bother by them, you must eat someting in between taking it. ",4
"I take this only for a short time, 3x a day for 3 days, then once a day for the next 3 days (steroid burst). It helps dramatically with severe asthma attacks. I take it with meals, and with a calcium supplement. I also use Advair and Singulair every day, and that usually controls my asthma very well. I was diagnosed with moderate asthma about 4 years ago.

"Have been on and off this for the past 7 years! ...was started on a 20mg tapper(7yrs ago), and am now on a 60mg tapper( as needed). I can usally go about 3 weeks between tappers, any longer and my lungs are so full of crud or inflammed I find myself at a local E.R seeking help and relief. It's the only med that works for my Asthma. All other inhaled meds cause horrible upper-respiratory infections. Have had the pleasure of having the following side-effects heartburn/reflux, sleeplessness, uneasyness, restlessness(lots of ness's.lol),mood swings, memory issues and weight gain to name a few.Although the symptoms I listed sound bad, when I have blood work done, it shows everything is within normal limits and fine (liver, heart ect.), only potassium is low.... Over all it does what it was made for, anti-inflammatory/ auto-immune suppressant. As a long term patient of Asthma/ Allergy...this and nebulizing is all I have to keep me going....overall I'm really pretty blessed that this is all thats alling me...others I'm sure have it worse than me....good luck.",5

Dosing 20 mg. 3 tabs, 3, 2, 2, 1, and 1 last and final tab/day etc.. It's worked better than anything. In truth when I have these very painful, almost debilitating pain flair ups only narcotic helps and that does get rid of the iflammation.  This time around we tried Prednisone and it worked in just over 24 hours. Even though this was in conjuction with Hydrocodone I know it worked because of much diminished inflammation and a return of strength and function in my left arm and shoulder.  Side effects - ate like a horse.  Unusual amount of energy and enthusiam for house cleaning, laundry, exercise.  Dose: 20mg - 3 tabs for 2 days, stepping down to 2 tabs for two days then one and one.  I've suffred from the iflammation and bouts of pain for years - tried everything and this is the first time I have seen results like this. As far as I am concerned they can keep me on it.",5
"I have mixed feelings about this medication. I was in the hospital just recently when my intestines were swollen shut due to Crohn's disease. They started me on an IV version of it which helped a lot. Now I am on the pill version. I have trouble gaining weight, so this will be a godsend for me, as it has been in the past when i have taken it. The only real problem i have is the taste. I have to plop it on the back of my tongue then chug the heck out of a drink so the taste doesnt permeate thorughout my entire mouth. Thats what makes it hard for me to use, that darn taste is horrible.",5

I moved some wood and inadvertently rubbed my face which lead to terrible swelling, itching, etc., around my eye.  Prednisone provided IMMEDIATE relief.  I have been filling very energetic but a little jumpy.  My arthritis isn't troubling me, so there are pleasant side-effects.  I am interested to see how I feel after I'm done with the predniszone.

Started with a shot in her office then the six day pack of six pills first day, 5 second day, 4 the fourth day..etc..  Sleepless night and achey joints-only 3 hours of sleep last night.  However, I feel a LOT better and I'm only on it six days, so heck, I guess I can live with some side effects to breath again!  Also took a breathing treatment and have inhaler..so something is working here.  Keep healthy snacks around, this does increase appitite, but soon goes back to normal when you get off the drug. Was on this about six years ago for same issue, was successful then as well.  Just weigh the pros and cons, I need to breath without pain and this helps.  I'll live with some side effects for six days to get my breathing under control.",4

I had huge blisters on my legs. turns out I had an allergic reaction to poison ivy and my doctor gave me prednisone. It worked great and quickly got rid of the blisters. But about a week after both my legs and both my arms broke out into a very itchy rash all over.

"I am taking prednisone for the reduction of swelling due to vasculitis in my lower legs.  I have been on very large doses from 100 mgs. daily and even have received larger doses when taking it along with chemo as part of the pre medicine.  I received doses of 1000 mgs. I am now down to replacement values which is 5 mg.  It has done what they said it would due and helped me in replacing what my body doesn't now.  Although, the side effects of the prednisone has been loss of bone density and especially tooth loss.  I have been advised to go easy on jumping or stepping off from steps or walls.    I have tried to find and have asked for a less harmful substitute many times.  Prednisone is the drug of choice by all doctors involved.  The main reasons I want off the prednisone is increased appetite and binge eating.  My weight gain has gone out of control.  I don't sleep though the night anymore and when I awaken, I'm in the fridge.  I have gained over 100 lbs from prednisone.",4
"I was prescribed this for my Eczema and Psoriasis for the first time about two years ago. Since then I've had to go back on small rounds of it several times. Although it is the only thing that's ever totally cleared up my skin, it also results in weight gain every time I've used it, as well as odd mood swings and even panic attacks. Once you're off the medication you're actually more susceptible to histamines. So, if you end the round of medication and are immediate exposed to something to aggravate your skin (for me, wet or humid weather for the most part) then any progress you made on the medication is totally reversed. For me this is what usually happens. Now I only refill my prescription for this if my skin has either gotten unbearable or if I have an event I need my skin clear for.  Overall, I really hate being on this medicine. However, it is still the only thing I've found to completely clear my skin.",5

"I am writing this while sitting in the wheelchair that prednisone put me into ten years ago after multiple years of mega-dosing for lupus. Back then it was the new 'wonder drug'. They didn't tell me me about avascular necrosis (it kills off the blood vessels in the femur,causing the femur head to snap off.) until it happened. That was the first time I had ever heard of it. A jagged dead bone rolling around in the groin is a Level 1000 pain.  Now I am reduced to roaming the medical landscape in search of a doctor with enough compassion to give me adequate pain management. I'm still looking. Informed choice re: the risks of ""better living thru chemistry"" is our right. A simple brochure would do the job. If you're considering removing my input because it discloses a negative truth about one of medicine's sacred cows, shame on you.

"In 2001 I had ITP,the spleen was eating my white count. Ask your doctor for Ativan to help with skittsy feelings and confusion. I was given 160 mgs per day for 2 months to try to trick my spleen into returning to normal. ITP is a juvenile disease of unknown cause, and I was 51 . It didnot work and I had my spleen removed. I lost about 6 weeks of time. I was told by my family that I would move things around and then I would not know where they were when I needed them. I was working for the phone comp. and would wander around around and cry at the office. My face got very round and I gained 40lbs. It was a horriable experience. I did have to take the drug again last year for an upper respatory infection, but was only on it for 10 days at a low dose and it worked.

My doctors were convinced that it was helping and wanted me to say on it, but I had no pain relief. I assume it just must have something to do with my body chemistry - some drugs work well for certain people.  I decided to wean myself off this drug after learning of all of the side effects combined with the fact that it just did not help. It took me about three weeks of slowly decreasing the dosage to get off the drug completely.  I experienced headaches and fatigue during this time.

"Taking medication for a muscle spasam and pinched nerves in the spine. This medication is doing what it is supposed to do. Here is a glitch. I received 65 (generic) pills to be taken initially two days of 10 pills (5mg each) then 9, 8,etc.  I know this will sound quite stupid but in the end I am 5 pills short which means I have done two things, The first took extra somewhere along the past five days even though I can count and the second failed to take another required (identical size, shape) medication due to the mixup. When this medication is prescribed especially for the elderly patient carefully pillbox and/or plastic bag the doses to avoid mixups in medication. This was NOT pharmacy error because I counted the pills before taking .   ",3
DRUG MADE MY FIBROMYALGIA WORSE,1
it is not good for me.,1
"I had a mild sinus infection for which I was taking an antibiotic a day before I had to fly to Paris from Houston I noticed a disconfort that as the hours went by became almost unbearable by the time I got to my destination.  The next day my face was swollen and in pain I went to a doctor and gave me a stronger antibiotic but the pain did not go away. By night time I could not stop crying and my face kept getting more inflamated. A nurse from the USA recomended for me to get on Steroids and gave me the name Prednisone, at first the pharmacist did not want to give it to me without a prescription but we asked her to call the doctor that had seen me earlier.  She gave me the steroids and in about five minutes later the pain was completely gone.  I was still swollen but with no pain whatsoever.",5

a lot of side affecets,2
"Started 5mg 1x per day in February 2010. Breathing was easier but have gained 24 lbs to-date. I can only stop for 1 or 2 days in a row otherwise I start to suffocate again. Very moody, Little sleep 4-5 hrs a night but it's better that feeling like every breath is my last!",5
"I've been on this prescription for three days now for an allergic reaction to latex paint that left me with horribly itchy hives(although my Dr. thought it could have been flees; she was treating me for the allergy first.)  Three days later my hives are almost completely gone and I'm starting to feel like a human being again--Plus it's getting rid of my bronchitis!  I keep checking my dog for flees and he's clean, I'm still going to treat him because it's that time.  The side effects however have been a little troublesome.  Sleepless nights, jitters, HORRIBLE mood swings (and my sister is NOT a patient person to live with), flashing between extreme cold but mild hot spells (which is different from what other people have reported but I can only assume it's because I'm anemic), and a bad case of the munchies.  Overall the benefits far outway the side effects.",5
"I took this medicine for lower back pain. After a few days it did seem to help a little. However, i would not recomend this because it did not do much to relieve the pain. ",2

This medication has affected my taste buds. Everything taste sickingly sweet.  My question is why.  [email protected],5
"Started off on high doses and tapered down.  Been taking prednisone for several years now and will have to take all my life.  I have had every side effect, gained 67# in 2 weeks, panic attacks, painful skin, acne, hair growth, retinopathy, you name it.  However it saved my life, and there really isnt anything else to take. (I was doing fertility treatments during disease onset).  Without it my liver will flare up again and I could die.  I have plenty of mixed emotions about this drug.  Just think long and hard before starting and ask questions, alot of questions",5
"Taking for asthma reaction/persistent cough due to H1N1 and subsequent infection causing asthma flare up. Three days into 7 day treatment (6 pill 2x day for 2 days, then descending). First day it lessened severe dry cough but now seems to aggravate it as day goes on.  Have found that night dose is causing nausea and have thrown up a couple of times within a few hours of dose.  Also have developed a facial rash (looks ""mottled"" as if blood vessels broken)on my forehead and eyelids. Of course, hot flashes and cheeks are bright red as well.  Is the facial ""mottling"" a normal reaction with this med???",3
Made me very worried and anxious while on this treatment. ,3
Be very careful taking this medicince with aspirin.  My 73 yr old father died suddenly last week due to a GI/stomach bleed. He was also taking an anti-inflammatory for his back and apparently all 3 can cause stomach bleeding.  The doctor knew my dad was taking aspirin but did not tell him to stop taking it for some reason.  He also should have probably been prescribed nexium or prilosec to help protect his stomach.  So be careful...I would hate to see this happen to someone else!,1
prescribed without a valid diagnosis,4
My four year old has been on it several times (only 3-5 days at a time) over the last 2.5 yrs. for severe allergies and it has worked wonderful cleared up everything in a matter of a day or two...the only thing that's really hard are the uncontrolable mood swings lots of tears for no apparent reason also it tastes pretty bad so I have the pharmacy flavor it with bubble gum flavor that works great for her!!!,5
"I was prescribed 60 mg for 2 weeks, 40 for 3 days, 110 for 3 days and 5 for 3 days - to treat a sudden hearing loss - the hearing loss is not improved and the side effects are awful.  I have not gotten more than 4 hours sleep a night since starting and still have 4 days to go.  Not to mentions the mood swings.  I will never take a steroid again!",1
"Received a shot for hives then took 3 20mg tablets for 3 days, then gradually off in 6 more days...i didn't like the way i felt, jittery, like amphetamines, glad to be coming off of it..can't imagine someone that takes a lot of this",5
"several months of acute pain and put in hospital twice i was prescribe Prednisone i am now able to wake up in the morning and have no pain and do my daily work i started on 40 mg a day and decreasing over a period of time my only concern is when i come of the drug that i will not have another attack,but would definatly recemend the drug,no side effects noted at this stage.",5
"HATE THE SIDE EFFECTS...NIGHT SWEATS, 8 POUND GAIN IN THREE DAYS, MUSCLE CRAMPS IN CALFS AND FEET, MOODINESS...BEEN ON FOR A MONTH, STARTED THREE TIMES A DAY, NOW TWO TIMES A DAY FOR ANOTHER MONTH....",4

"I broke out in Hives due to an Allergic reaction. I was prescribed a 7day 50mg of Prednigsone. No Tapering was EVER mentioned and I asked plenty of question to the doctor and the pharmacist who both indicated this was a high dose but never mentioned side affects of stopping cold turkey. I'm floored by that as I look on the web and see so many Mg by Mg step down pescriptions given. I even called the nurse hot line at that same hospital to ask if I should tapper off. First she said of course I told her my symptoms where gone and I discovered the allergin and was no longer in contact with it so I'd like to taper off this asap. She put me on hold and came back to say its ok to stop cold turkey when youre on it for a short time like mine 7 days, really 8days if you include one taken at hospital. She also said I can't tell you it's ok to stop taking the drug after four days. I said I'm not asking that I'm asking what are the side effects of stopping cold turkey even after the prescribed 7 days she read me a list of side effects if I where stopping after having been on it for a prolonged period and told me I may just have some nausa from stopping after 7or 8days of 50 Mg. This doesn't seem right to me especially because she tried to tell me earlier maybe the doctors didn't think to tapper me off because (50mg) was a small dose. I called her on that lie and she put me on hold and changed her story. Kinda scary. I thank God for the internet and for everyones experiences that inform our own. I'll call my sister a 20 yr nurse now for advice but I think I'll tapper any way to be safe. I'm dancer and the muscle and bone problems that can arise from this drug are way to scary and could end my career. ",4
terrible side effects very bad taste  .the doseage should be in one pill not five as i'm taking,5
"I was prescribed this for treatment with Bell's Palsy..I am most always a very happy upbeat person, but this medication made me completely opposite.. very lightheaded, dizzy, just not feeling like myself at all, mood swings, iritable, headaches..thank goodness i finished my last dose two days ago but am still having horrible side effects hoping they will go away in a couple more days, im ready to feel like myself again",2
I have been having horrible headaches on this medication.,4
"I have taken prednisone many times for my asthma as well as bronchitis. It seems to work but the side effects always cause me to dread taking it. I have muscle pain in my legs, increased appetite, trouble sleeping and when I do sleep it is very lightly, trouble concentrating, only good side effect is increased energy but it also feels like nervousness.",4
"I was prescribed prednisone for severe temporal arteritis.  A large dosage given in the hospital after diagnosis and biopsy basically gave me my life back after 3 months.  I began with 40 mg. per day after release from the hospital and am down to 15 per day after a year and a half.  I hope to continue this decrease until I can quit the medication.  The only side effect I have experienced is cataracts which I have had successfully removed recently.  I owe my eye sight to a wonderful doctor who diagnosed this illness after 3 months of no diagnosis, multiple hospital stays, and multiple emergency room visits.  I am lucky to have my sight and my health.  ",5
I have asthma and this is the first time my doctor has ever prescribed this for me. I came down with sever lung infection with congestion in my lungs and nasal cavities. I took 50 mg the first day decreasing 10 mgs for the next 7 days. So far the only side effect has been severe night sweats the first night but my lungs/sinus improved almost immediately. I think I can deal with any side effects if I am only on it for 7 days. 24 hours later and so far so good.,5
"Initially, euphoria, significant decrease of abdominal and joint pain, high energy.  Sleeplessness became a recurrent problem, I usually need a sleep aid now.  Headache is constant after 4 weeks, sometimes severe. When I retire to bed, my heart pounds for several minutes.  I am more irritable than usual.

"i have/am experiencing every side effect there could be with having to take prednisone at these high levels (first 60mg down now to 20 mg per day) for the treatment of inflammation of my lungs. I know that Steroids in any form aren't good for you, especially taking then like this. Is there no alternative? ",3
"My son is on this for an upper respitory infection, and it seems to be working well taking down the swelling and helping him breathe better at night when he is sleeping.",4
It has done a really good job with my bood condition.,5
I have been taking this drug for one year now and other then taste i think it works great.It sure saved my life,5
"I really wish that this drug did not work.  I was on 40mg/day for 6 weeks, and it turned my digestive tract into one raw nerve.  I have been trying to wean from this drug for almost 2 years, but symptoms return at some point in the process. Was down to 2mg, and now I'm back to 5.  The drug makes me manic-depressive, and at large doses, it made me high. I now have to take medicines to counterract the effects on my bones.  Can't get off the medical merry-go-round.",5
"I am taking this for extreme lower back & left leg pain. One dose out of 6 has already given very good results. It seems to be sciatica or something similar. I have had an MRI which shows that I do have a bad lumber & Degenerative Disc Disease, etc. My recent pain was caused by shoveling & snowblowing the 40+ inch totals I've had at my home.",5

I was prescribed this medication because of a horrible sinus infection.  What I am amazed at is that I have had psoriosis for over 25 years and it is mysteriously gone.  I have had it one my elbows and knees and for the fiorst time I can feelo them again.  I attribute it to this medicationb.  I just pray it doesn't come back since I have now stopped the meds.,5
"a lot of pills (up to 12 a day), and seems to go right through me.  Not sure if it helps or just prevents things from getting worse.  Does not make me feel any better, just might prevent things from getting worse.",3
"The prednisone works very well for reducing the swelling associated with asthma and allergies. However, the taste is so horrendous! I can't believe they cannot coat these pills!  I have to tuck them into food to swallow and keep them down! :  (",5
"By the 5th or 6th day of a 12 day treatment plan, I have developed a cough that seems to be due to a pressure point in my throat. The cough has become increasingly persistent.  I am now on day 7 and the cough now interrupts my sleep.",3
I'm sure the medication has helped because my throat is not sore and the swelling in my neck is gone. But I'm a little afraid of the drug and have been really MORE nervous taking it. ,2
This Medication is becoming a nightmare!! Its been 10 days since I took my last dose which I took for 6 days to treat a full body flare up of eczema. And now I'm menstruating 1 week early and am having heart palpitations that are so annoying and borderline scary. Waiting to speak to Doc in the a.m.... I thought this was going to be simple.. Guess not.. After reading someones comment about suffering with the heart palpitations for over a year after taking prednisone I'm praying this doesn't happened to me and require additional medications!!! ,5

"I'd like to share my experiences taking Predinsone on a long-term bases & the side effects I still have with this drug. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this drug to be taken long-term because of the side-effects. I have sever rheumatoid arthritis and was give this drug along with others to try to combat the pain, stiffness and swelling I suffer with. I have been on this drug on & off for about 10 years, but started taking it daily about 5 years ago, I was prescribed 15 mg daily, but if I had flair-ups I could take up to 20 mg. At first, this drug did wonders for me, but after taking it daily over the last 5 years, I gained about 60 pounds, got the ""moon face,"" my skin tears easily, I bruse easily and the bruses do not go away, I've had some for over 1 year now. The worst side-effect was developing AVN, (Avascular Necrosis). This drug ate through my spine, hips and knees; my bone scans were/are horrible and I still break bones a lot, especially my toes and ribs. I ended up in the hospital in Acute Rehab (Phyical Therapy), for 1 month (without surgery) just so I could roll over in bed, stand, walk with a walker and to use to wheelchair. My dr is now trying to taper me off this drug, but it's slow & painful. I take high doses of OxyContin, Percocet & Celebrex for pain relief, but the pain I'm in tapering me off the Prednisone terrible. However, if I don't get off it, I cannot have my knees replaced and the weight will just keep coming on. I am down to 7 mg daily & it's taken me 1 year to get from 15 mg to 7 mg. Taking this drug for short-term usage is great, but don't take it on a long-term basis, the side-effects are terrible.   ",5

I had become excruciatingly thin and unable to gain weight no matter how many calories I ate. I am now on 5mg a day and next week, that will be cut to every other day.  This drug saved my life! I feel better than I have felt in fifteen years.",5

"SHingles..on face and near eye... the medication raised my blood sugar, made me nauseated and caused chest pain, which I believe was more ""ulcer pain""  but it was mid chest/sternum.... It raised my b/p and was admitted to hosp. for cardiac work up.. I asked to have ""ulcer cocktail' zylocaine to rule out ulcer but went through all the way to cardiac cath.. heart was Ok, they decided it was prednisone.

very dissatisfied with this treatment,1
when i started taking the medication i had started developing muscle spasms is this a side effect.,3
"My elderly at-risk father is prescribed this medication periodically after his COPD flare-ups (that lead to pneumonia and hospitalization). On this drug, he goes from being tremendously fatigued and almost at death's door to the ""energizer bunny on crack."" On the negative side, he becomes mean and manic, experiences extreme mood swings, develops even more trouble with sleeping, and tends to alienate everyone in his path. On the positive side, he is moving more and has loads more energy. Nothing gets him up, moving, and motivated like this drug. Most importantly, on prednisone his breathing has shown vast improvement (which is the primary purpose for him). Good thing he only has to remain on it a short time. In spite of the drawbacks, it does help his breathing a lot. It is better to know what to expect, and that is the medicine that is the cause of the antagonistic emotional dynamic that develops. I am not sure either of us could handle that nasty side effect long term, and it subsides as he tapers off of it. Sometimes you really have to weather the worst in order to embrace the best.",4
"I have COPD and everytime my chronic bronchitis flares up I am given this. I cannot stand this drug do to the fact, I have severe mood swings and thoughts of suicide. But I was told that with my condition there isnt anything else they can give me. ",3

I have been on anything and everything you can think of. This is the only thing that STOPPED my eczema, and it didn't come back for over a month. I wish I was able to be on this for a lot of time, as opposed the short week that I am on them.",5
i had an asthma attack wheezing chest pain shortness of breath,5
I found that I started feeling agitated over things I typically would not.  I was impulsive and quite reactive.  I didn't think it was because of the prednisone but I can't attribute it to anything else.,5

I have been taking this med for about 1.5 months and do have relief from the inflammation of arthritis. However I now have a yeast infection could it be from this med? Do have a lot of diarhhea don't now if it is from this med or the arava that I take. Any answers,5
This drug has relieved Gout symptoms within one day and I was able to return to work the next day.,5
"Since starting this medicine, I have been so extremely nervous, and so very hungry that all I want to do is eat.  I'm coming off a 100 lb. weight loss from suspected Crohn's Disease of the stomach.  No definite diagnosis has been made at this time.  Is is normal for me to feel so hungry all the time?  I will not see my Dr. in  Cleveland until sometime in February.  My symptoms from the suspected illness has calmed down somewhat while taking a combination of the Prednisone and Zofran.  I really hate the way the steroid makes me feel.",3
It has increased my appeite quite a lot.,5
"It was almost impossible to control my sugar levels (diabetic) which caused me to have to take four times the amount of insulin, I usually take. All and all, I hate taking this drug. I feel so better now thta I no longer take this medication. Beware of this drug and the side effects",4

This drug is extremely helpful for taking away arthritis inflammation.,5
"Treating acute bronchitis.  I started with 4 10mg tabs for 4 days.  I started feeling like my head was blown up and I was in a daze with this high dose.  It is being gradually reduced.  I have noticed an increase in my appetite and can't stop going from ""salty to sweet"" foods.  I hope this subsides after I am off of this.  It is helping as I had terrible wheezing and coughing.  Along with other meds I am on I hope to feel better soon.  I am not a big advocate of prednisone, but I guess if it is needed and controlled (under Dr. supervision) it is a good medication.",4
"I felt so bad for so long and the first day I took Predisone, I felt some better.  I still get tired easily and have to rest and I still have a lot of stiffness, but I never thought I would feel human again so I`m very grateful to Predisone for helping me as much as it has.",4
"I have been off and on prednisone for a few different conditions. It is incredibly effective at controlling inflamation.  However, if you are on it for any longer than a few weeks (including while you are tapering the medication), the side effects can really get to you. I've experienced almost all of them and, depending on your condition, some of them can be worse than the disease being treated. Short-term, it's a great drug (you'll feel like Superman), but I suggest you weigh the condition being treated against the potential side effects before you start on it. Be sure to ask your doctor exactly how long you will have to take the drug, including any necessary tapering (tapering is a big deal because it can take anywhere from a few days to-- more likely-- months). The most common side effect is an increased appetite and weight gain, but depending on your dosage, length of treatment and your own personal reaction to it, you can also experience an increase in blood pressure, night sweats, a redistribution of body fat (moon face, buffalo hump, back fat), mood swings, thinning of the skin, acne, rosacea, acid reflux, joint pain, bone loss, depression as well as a bunch of other side effects.  It is a wonderful and horrible drug. If you are only on prednisone for a few weeks, you'll feel great and likely not get much more than an short-lived increase in appetite. And like I said, it stops inflammation in its tracks, but watch out for those side effects and consider alternative treatments if you're going to need to be on prednisone long-term.  Oh, and one quick note. Most of prednisone's side effects come from how it mimics cortisol in the body. I've been told that the body's normal level of cortisol is around 7.5 mg. So, if you're on any more than 15 mg of prednisone for an extended period of time, you'll likely face some of those side effects. If you're on a higher dose for a short period of time, you may still be fine, but, again, be sure to keep tapering in mind.",4
"I have been prescribed this medication on many many different occasions over a 15 year period.  I have not taken this medication in about 10 years now as I had such a severe reaction to it last time I was prescribed Predisone.  Apparently, I am one of the people who develope the rare side effect of nerve sensitivity and the last time I took this, it was so severe, it hurt to just lay there, so I took myself off it and have not taken it again.",4
"Also use inhaled steroid and betablocker when needed. improves skin allergies, only effective for about 12 hours.  I take 5 milligrams only. 10 mg or more crestes trembling",4
"I was on this horrendous medication for 1 mo. for severe shin splints that had me almost unable to walk.  The medication made me gain @ least 10lbs, I was super irritable all of the time & was miserable.  I didn't sleep well & the pain never subsided.  I will NEVER take this or anything like this medication EVER again! ",1
"I've been on Prednisone for 6 months now, doses ranging from 20 mg - 60 mg. I suffer from insomnia, nervousness, irritability, hair growth and puffy face. I've been lucky to kinda keep my weight down but just from trying to eat right. It's a tough drug but I'm very grateful for it because it's helped me with my disease.",5
i did not like it,3
"I had an allergic reaction, and was prescribed prednisone. While on it I was unable to eat. I felt like I was going to have another allergic reaction. Lips, airway, tongue felt funny. Drank ensure through straw until I finished the prednisone since I couldn't eat. Still unable to eat, and drink all the things I did before prednisone without feeling like I'm going to have a reaction.",4
The weight gain is the worst thing that i can say about it ,1
"I was prescribed this medication due to intense tonsil and neck gland swelling from mono. Huge decrease in tonsil swelling after just one dose! I'm on a 9 day regiment - 60mg for 5 days, 40mg for 2 days, then 20mg for 2 days. I can breath and swallow without wincing in pain! Slight stomach upset but took a Zantac (as suggested by the doctor and pharmacist) and upset disappeared.",5
"I have been taking 10mg daily for 10 years in addition to Enbrel to combat RA.  Over time I have noticed water weight gain in my stomach, legs, and face along with thinning bones and extreme muscle loss.  I look overweight with skinny arms and a puffy face and I bruise very easily.  In the beginning (10 years ago) it made me feel great but that was short lived.  If I could get off this crap I would but I have been told I have been on it too long to stop.  If you can avoid this drug, do so.  Useful for short term (10-14 days)but not for the long haul. ",3

"I take the step down package for severe asthma attacks. In addition, Adviar  2 times per day, 10mg prednisome maintinance. I become psychotic on the first three days. It does work.

Pain in both knees so horrible I could not walk and contemplated going to the ER. Doctor should have gradually decreased the dose. Be aware! ",4
"I was originally prescribed 60mg a day and suddenly I got an excrusiating headache, so bad that my husband had to take me to the ER.  By the time I got to ER, I was in such pain that I started hallucinating and forgetting almost everything.  To this day, I can't remember some things from that ER visit.  Had temporal biopsy on both sides and was confirmed that I had inflammation of temporal arteries.  Was told that I had allergic reaction to too much prednisone and was decreased to 40 mg a day.  So far am tolerating it somewhat.  Have to stay on it for 1 1/2 to 2 years.  I HATE THIS DAMN MEDICATION.  TOO BAD THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT CAN'T COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE.",3
"I was prescribed a 9 day regimen starting our with 60 mg for 3 days, down to 40 mg for 3, down to 20 mg for the last 3 days for allergies.  Allergies were causing my eustacian tube in my ear to stop up which was like talking in a barrel.  My internest first prescribed OTC medicines, but after a week, I went to an urgent care to see if they could help, and they prescribed it.  I'm on day one of the prednisone, and as has been reported in some of the other posts, it's been a sleepless nite.  I'm hoping that day 2 will have some adjustment in the sleeping pattern, but the drug has a definate positive effect during the day.",4

My heart sometime speed up and sometime slows down, the pain in my whole body is great, the doctors know nothing yet they act as if they know somtehing about Sarcoidosis. (Just an act)I try to keep my head up, yet it keeps falling down, They say i have Sarcoidosis and fibromyalgia, i have these little nodules popping up all over my body, and know one cares.

"I was diagnosed in April of 2009 with a rare muscullar disease, so the doctors immediatley put me on 60 mg of prednisone. I had to stop my sports and all physical activity. I slowly noticed persistant weight gain and three months later, in July, my cheeks began to swell. It is now 7 months later and I have extremely improved in the area of my disease, but the medicine has taken a toll. I have gained 30 pounds, now have an extremely round face, minor depression, full-on acne on face back and chest, ravenous hunger, and extreme mood-swings. I was lucky enough to not suffer from the usual sleeplessness or mania that prednisone normally causes, but for a 16-year-old girl, these other symptoms are tramatic. I started an intense workout rountine for the past 2 weeks, and have only lost 2 pounds. I eat significantly less and workout hard, but the weight seems to remain. I have a love-hate reationship with this drug. I believe it is what saved all the muscles in my body, but I can't imagine the internal damage it is causing considering all of the external damage. Be prepared for a tough time with side affects from the first day you take this drug. Whether you take it for a week or a year, you will be effected. ",4
"Taken for genital ulcers and pain caused by Behcet,s Disease.Severe weight gain,puffy face,feeling high.My son who was breastfed whilst I was taking them suffered hair loss on one side of his head and severe stomach cramps almost immediately,and his teeth had been effected while still in the gums.The medication worked quickly and well for what it was prescribed for,but the side effects both on me and my son were horrendous.",5
"I was prescribed a 10 day course of prednisone for muscle spasms related to inflamation in my lower back several months post back surgery.  It was very successful in treating my symptoms, but I have had EXTREME racing thoughts, very, very little sleep and what I would consider mania.  Saw a doctor today and found out it may be caused by prednisone.  I have one left and I'm not taking it.",5
I took this med when my allergies flared up.  It would help rid my lungs of all the mucus so that I would not have trouble with my asthma.  Been on this med several different times and have never experienced any problems.,5

"Until about two years ago the Prednisone still worked its magic in knocking down my atopic dermatitis flare-ups.  I'd taken Prednisone orally (usually 2 to 3 X's/Year) in various regimens over the past (probably) 25 to 30 + years, almost always, over that time, accompanied by an antibiotic, until these last two years.  Although past flare-ups of rashes and itching didn't show signs of  infection, my white blood count would spike severely and indicate the need.  Recently (last 2 years or so) I haven't had the, distracted,  foggy-headedness that would indicate the need for the antibiotics, and so was usually not prescribed them.  I've not been able to decide if Prednisone's INEFFECTIVENESS over these last two years is due to the changes in me -- or the lack of the antibiotic kicker -- or, if over time, it just no longer ""works"".  (I have, also, over those many years been on topical hydrocortizone 2.5%, and a few others during flares.)  The Dermatologist is now having me try Singulair, a tab for Asthma (too soon to say about that one), and I found an OTC salve called Florasone; it doesn't seem to do much for the underlying problem, but it DOES tame some of the surface inflammation.  I've found that SUNSHINE (in moderation!) is helping too.",3
"I have been taking Prednisone for the past two years.  I have a flare up about once a month.  At that time it is extremely difficult to walk.  It feels like I am walking on broken glass.  My wrists hurt and some of my fingers swell up. It is difficult to drive, the hands are weak.  When I have a flare up I take 40 mg of prednisone for 2 days and gradually decrease it.  All my symptoms magically disappear and I feel great again. The doctor wants me to decrease the dose, but when I get down to 12 mg, the flare comes back.  The doctor has me taking methotrexate now but nothing helps as much as the prednisone. Side effects seem to be a shaky left hand and difficulty sleeping, but it is a small price to pay for being able to walk. By the way, the methotrexate's side effect has caused me to have curly hair.  (I have had straight hair all my life.)",5

I have experienced hyperactivity, mania, shaking, increased appetite, overactive mastication, nutty thoughts, sleep loss; and headaches, muscle pain, and other weird stuff as a result of the other side effects.  On the up-side, I've been wildly productive.

I continued it for some time with no side effects, except weight gain, but I was obsese to begin with.  When I go off the Prednisone I am in great pain again in hips and legs.

After three days the Poison Ivy is nearly dried out and I've not experienced any significant side effects.  I've used Prednisone for other issues in the past (e.g. throat infection) and been happy with the results then as well.

I am getting to the end of my rope as far as standard treatments go, and I know Prednisone isn't meant for long term use, but I would definitely consider it if nothing else works. I have energy, bowels have been normal, consistant, overall my quality of life is almost normal. Don't let other reviews scare you...Yes I eat a bit more, but the amount of energy I have keeps my weight at bay. Definitely worth a shot. Pros GREATLY outweigh the cons in my case.",5

Gained weight and after 2 years holding down weight from weight watchers too! Played havoc with my hot flashes, and woke up 2 hours earlier than normal. When drove, every now and then would press on brake instead of gas. I wrote down every dose and matched it up with directions, leaving nothing to memory.  Good thing I did.  Hopefully I loose the added weight and get back to normal. Once is enough for me. I will insist on something not so strong.  Hopefully not a next time to need it. I kept a positive attitude as best I could so that the side effects I read would not take hold of me.  I think it has worked. Short term looks like best way.  Long term, you need a close relationship with your doctor.",5

"I was surprised at the number of negative comments about this drug. I have been perscribed prednisone a number of times in the last 10 years and I have never experienced any of the problems others are reporting. I was on this drug for 6 months prior to surgery and 3 months after with very minimal negative symptoms. I actually felt as though my energy had increased and this led to having a hard time sleeping and when I would sleep I would have very intense dreams, but once your body gets used to the medication the symptoms do wear off.

"I did not like this even though I knew I would ge insonmia and weight gain. I continued to get sweaty, nausea, dizzy and I even got a broken leg from it. I was taking it for my non-hodgkins lymphoma.  I told the doctor about my symptoms and he said it was the chemo doing it to me.  But I knew better and I have been finished with my chemo since July. I told him this on September 15th and I broke my leg on September 24th. So what can I say.",1

Right now, it has somewhat helped my Colitis, but not as much as is should considering the terrible side effects. I feel like I am hungry ALL the time (which doesn't help in my Colitis issues). I'm also up at 5 AM everyday with too much energy and can't function after 9 PM. Mood swings are terrible as well. ",3
"I was hospitalized due to negative oxygen absorbtion in my right lung. (I was put on 100% oxygen).  After failed attempts to treat the infection in the lung, an Infection Disease Control specialist suggested a treatment plan which included Prednisone.  I underwent a biopsy of the lung, and all the tests they ran were inconclusive.  Luckily for me the other doctor was right in starting me on this steroid.  I am now (2 months later) free of this infection in my lung. Though there still has not been an explaination of what this particular infection was, I recovered faster than any of my medical team had predicted. A surgeon did a biopsy on the infected tissue of my lung and still no explaination.  To this day no-one knows what kind of infection it was, they only know that the steroid (Prednisone) has successfully cleared it up.  nly question remaining is --- if I have to take this the rest of my life.  If I do, I'm not worried about any side effects because all this medicine has done, is brought my health back.  Thank You LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",4

"I have had autoimmune disease my whole life. It was finally diagnosed at 27. I have resisted being put on pred. until my symptoms became to much. The higher doses I did not like at all, couldn't sleep, anxiety, etc.  However when I got down to 5mg I experienced all the good without the bad. when it started hurting my stomach I got empty capsules at the health food store and put the pred. inside. It works well for me. Now the doctor wants to take me of and my symptoms are coming back. Double edged sword.  ",5

"I was diagnoise with severe Ulcerative Colitis with the possiblity of removal of the colon. It's not known in the family and I'm 45 years old. After reading most of the reviews about Prednisone, I had my reservations about taking this product; all I can say that it delayed me from taking it for 2 weeks, which was a big mistake considering what they wanted to do. Not only was my condition getting worst, but I let my fear take over the common sense of my doctor who is the professional. To date, I can say that I have experience not one of any of these myriad side effects with this drug. I been taking it for close to 3 weeks (40mg week 1, 35mg week 2, 30 week 3 and so on) and my symptoms have all disappeared. In fact, I have never felt better in the last 15 years. It's a great feeling not living in fear if I can hold onto my inner without soiling myslef. I have gain my freedom by going on my first long roadtrip with me not driving without wondering if I'll make it after the first few miles. All I can say is thanks to this drup called Prednisone!

"I was diagnosed with Dermatomyositis and have been on 50mg of Prednisone for about a month and a half now. The first 2 or 3 weeks for me were great because the excruciating pain from the disease was going away (I was at the point where I started to wonder if I would be able to walk anymore). Now it's a different story...now I absolutely HATE it. The side effects are hitting me and it's almost too much to handle. The ""moon face"" especially. I can't bear to even look at myself in the mirror. I don't feel like I gained all too much weight, it feels more like I'm just bloated every where. I already had depression, so this medication seems to only worsen it. My vision is also getting blurry and I had lasik surgery 2 years ago so I know it's the Prednisone causing it.  It's nice to know that others are going through similar feelings as well. It might sound vain complaining about the side effects, but really, it's a challenging experience because it's like you wake up one day and you don't even recognize your own face/body. ",3

Was prescribed as part of infection control after severe sinus infection.  While using this medication I did not have to use my combivent inhaler of Advais Diskus for asthma.,4
"I have used 10 - 15 mg. of Prednisone daily since 1990 to treat muscular dystrophy. There is no question that it extended my ability to walk by several years and to this day I have better than expected muscle function.  This has not come without a significant number of side effects, however. I almost immediately developed stomach ulclers. This required lowering the dose from 20 mg. per day down to the 10 - 15 that I use now and the addition of an acid blocker with occassional use of carafate. Drinking alkaline water has also helped alleviate this bothersome side effect substantially.  I also developed persistent fungal infections that continue to be a problem and frequently will have other infections that the Prednisone masks. My appendicitis was diagnosed very late and the appendix ruptured on the operating table. UTI's have also been a problem.  There have also been some psychological effects that I attribute to prednisone with moderate depression and anxiety requiring some medication.  This year I learned that I now have osteoporsis despite years of high dose Vitamin D and calcium taken in an effort to preserve bone density, so I am also on Fosomax.  I have developed overactive bladder and possibly BPH requiring two more medicines. This might also be somewhat related to the Prednisone.  This is a very mixed bag in my view. Do the benefits of maintaining some muscule strength justify all of the side effects? At this point I would still answer yes. Hopefully better treatments will become available in the not too distant future.",3

I'm also taking Colchicine an anti-inflammatory medication.  The steroids  cause me to be hyper, moody, angry and outspoken.  I pace the floor and complain.  When I'm having a steroid ""rush"" I can't seem to stop talking and become obsessed with problems and solving them.  I also very feel very hot but do not have a fever.  I am extremely hungry.  Although, I'm not craving sweets in an excessive manner.  I want meat, potatoes, vegetables, salads, canned fruit and cereal. I have a modest & reasonable craving for chocolate.  After talking to my Dr. she advised me to change my dosage schedule and begin my day with 1 steroid pill at 9:00 a.m. then take my 2nd final dose for the day at 1:00 p.m.  This has allowed me to sleep at night.  This medication is effective for my illness and the right drug for my condition.  In my situation the side effects are annoying and unavoidable but worth the healing that it's giving me.   ",5

This got my attacks down to 3, 30 min attacks, which is a hell of an improvements, but the side effects where devastating. I did not sleep, agitation, sweats, stomach problems, shaking all over palpations etc etc. It only gave me 4 days relief, over 3 weeks treatment (with taper) but I think if you are as desperate as i was, it was worth it",5

"After a recent flare-up which has severely limited my appetite and brought my weight down to 95 pounds, I've been put back on this drug. I had no problems the first time I took it other than swelled cheeks so I expected a similar experience this time; Was I in for an unpleasant surprise! Since I started it a day ago I've experienced constant abdominal pain which drifts from tolerable to excruciating quite unpredictably. I have come very close to vomiting several times since, mostly during the night. It makes me incredibly hungry, which is beneficial considering my previous lack of appetite, but I feel the cons far outweigh the pros in this instance. My mother already has a very low opinion of this drug from what she's read online, and after reading some of the comments here and factoring in my own experience, I honestly don't see how any doctor could in good faith prescribe a drug with such dreadful side effects. Thankfully another appetite stimulant was also prescribed to me, so I'll see how that works out for me. Avoid this drug at all costs!",4
"I have just started prednisone and already my cough is becoming much less!  My chest feels better and the shortness of breath is not there!  It must  be a very good drug.  My doctor has put me on it for a period of2 weeks, one pill twice a day. the dose is 20 ml.",5

"The ONLY side effect other than increased hunger was my skin thinned A LOT and I dind't realize it was the Prednisone causing it, I thought I was aging fast.  It took all the pain and joint swelling away.  I would have never taken it had I realized how much my skin would thin.  I was on it for almost 2 years.  Small dose at the end.  Have been off for a month now and I am miserable.  All my joints hurt, my hands are swollen, and I am so tired I can hardly get though a day. I feel like I have a bad case of the flu with no fever. Going to see the doctor tomorrow for something new. ",5
"I have been taking this medication on and off for 22 years for Crohn's Disease.  This is a great medicine for relieving the swelling and giving me immediate relief within days.  The side effects are horrible and I wonder if it worth taking the medication. I am currently on 60mg a day and the sweating, mood swings, not sleeping, increased appetite, horrible acne on my chest and face and joint pain.  Please remember these are only the side effects when I am on prednisone, the long term side effects are just as bad.  I am only 41 and from taking this medication over 20 years I have permanent joint pain and arthritis.  I would only take this drug if you have tried everything else, because the doctors don't mention the long term side effects and there are plenty.  And I am still a very active man with lots of joint pain.  Please be careful before you conceder taking this medication.  I would not give this medication to my 2 children if that tells you how I feel about this medication.  It's a saving grace now, but not later.",5

Some of them include: the urge to ""eat all the time, rapid weight gain; especially in my ""trunk"" area,  swelling feet and ankles, hand shakes, sleeplessness, hip discomfort and weakness, sensitive teeth just to name a few.

I am afraid of what this drug may do.  I am only on 10mg for a 12 day period.  I'm thinking about stopping after only this first day.  I'm not nor have ever been on daily meds at 52 years old.  I'm curious to know if being in good health will prevent any of these nasty side effects.  I feel so terrible for those of you who have long lasting issues as a result of taking this drug.  My doctor only said that I may retain fluids and gain weight with this medication.  I hope that if I do take as prescribed the low dosage will not lead to such drastic side effects.,3

I'm up walking in a day or two from being completely bed ridden and unable to move at all due to the severe pain shooting through my entire body.  It cuts my healing time down to a couple weeks vs a few months.  The pain pills and muscle relaxers don't help much but the Prednisone sure does.  It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth and I heard it's really bad to take for more than a couple weeks because it just destroys your body from the inside out.  It really a miracle for me.  Also, it makes me really hot when I'm on it.  Not sweaty but really really warm.",4

"this medication was the worst thing that EVER HAPPENED TO ME. i am 18 years old and was diagnosed with indeterminate colitis my senior year of highschool. i will gladly live with my debilitating symptoms of colitis before ever returning to this drug. it was somewhat effective but was no where near worth it. i was on 40 mg for about 4 months and then tapered off. i gained 20 lbs in 2 weeks and it completely disfigured my body. i have deep and permanent stretch marks on my hips and thighs. my appetite was out of control and my face swelled to the point i was asked if i got my wisdom teeth out on a daily basis. increased hair growth, terrible joint pain, night sweats, all the side affects my doctors hardly mentioned. i was an emotional wreck, had dozens of public freak outs of break downs. i had no control over myself emotionally and physically and became depressed as a direct result of this drug. i have been completely off prednisone for a few months now and am still trying to cope with the side effects, some permanent. this drug is literally the worst thing that ive ever experienced and wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy. i am now on remicade and doing cortisone enemas (ask your doctor about them, they are an easy treatment that has really helped me). if youre starting prednisone i hope you have better luck, if those side effects start GET OFF THE DRUG. i waited for my doctors to take action and i deeply regret it. again, i cannot even put into words how terrible this drug is. look at other options!!!!",4

Only visible side effects was SEVERE/HEAVY night sweats which required the changing of sheets in bed and clothes off my own back multiples times throughout the time.

Huge urge to eat pizza (whole pizza) and burritos (multiple). Also was taking Enbrel and Methotrexate which at the time seemed to help but really wasn't doing much.

A miracle drug yes but also lots of side effects when you get older. So I don't want to end up like that he is suffering so much now. What are we to do? Eat whole organic foods, excersise (water aerobics has done wonders for me, Easter seals pools are 94 degrees warm and you can move your joints so much easier in that warm water) also NATE allergy elimination to strengthen the immune system.

"I've been taking prednisone for about 4 months for PMR - an inflammation of joints and muscles all over my body & Temporal Arteritis.  I started on a high dose, that gave relief in about 4 days. I now take 20mg every other day.  My pain level has dropped dramatically (from 9 to around 3 most days).  However, I continue to experience the following side effects: weight gain, edema, hot flashes and occassional high spikes in my blood sugar levels.  As unpleasant as these side effects are, I will take them over the extreme pain I was experiencing before.",4
Inflammation of internal stiches related to foot surgery.  (two months post op)  Predensone seems to be working as intended.,4
i've been on this since jan. 2009 and anti biotics so far neither seem to work for long after i finish the antibiotic i'm told to continue the prednisone then i start to swell up like a balloon about three to five days after antibiotics are done my breathing gets worse and some kind of growth starts to swell in my wind pipe and blocks my breathing,2

"Was put on a 12 day prescription.  6 for the first 5 days, 4 for a few, then down to 2 for the last four.  Worse symptons is joint pain.  My knees feel like they have cotton in the joints and there are some bruises around them.  They are also visible swollen.  Also, my jaw is constantly clenched since I have started taking this medication.  It helped the chest pain that I was having from bronchitis very quickly, within 2-3 days. ",4
"I currently suffer with Hives and Angioedema. Have had it now for 3 weeks. It's very prevalent in the mornings. I wake up with my hands and sometimes feet very swollen. I also get pencil eraser sized spots on my stomach, back, head, and neck. My doc prescribed me 40mg of Prednisone to take once a day. It knocks out everything in about 2.5 to 3 hours and I am fine for the rest of the day. The next morning I have the swollen hands and ichy spots again until I take the pills to knock it out. I'm at my 7th day on this and the doc won't prescribe me any more. I hope I don't see any side affects but I'm more worried about the hives and the affects it has on my hands and feet. ",5
"I am in my mid 50's i have been taking this drug off and on again for a very long time, it is to be used as a short term drug, it really helps my asthma, with a short 8 to 10 day use, tapering off is a must just don't stop taking it, if you can get past a few days of being uncompy it is a good drug and in the long run you will be happy",5
It helps me breathe much better and also makes me eat more.,5
I had a pretty nasty case of poison ivy and was put on prednisone for 2 weeks starting off with 70mg and going down from there. I was very concerned about taking the drugs after reading the reviews below. I do NOT like side effects! After being calmed down by a dermatologist friend I began the cycle. One week later and the poison ivy is basically gone and I have experienced very little if any of the side effects. I had one night of restless sleep and the pills do make me a bit gittery but also gave me extra energy which was nice. I would take prednisone again if need be. Dont worry too much about the side effects! ,5
have been taking for 4 months for skin condition of dermititus.  Started with Cyclosporon which worked for a while and then when it stopped working Prednisone was added.  began with 50 mg a day and reduced.  am now taking 10 every other day.  face is moon face and have gained 20 lbs in last couple of weeks.  need off this drug quickly as I am miserable.,4

I had bronchitis for 2 weeks. My severe cough was gone in 3 days. Taking 1 20mg pill for 8 days. I had no side effects. I have no additional health problems. I am 28 years old.,5
"I was diagnosed with bronchitis brought on by my asthma and allergies. It worked right away to clear up the congestion I had in my chest, but caused severe nausea around the 3rd day of taking it. ",5
"I use a predisone shot every year for my allergies ,and it worked till this year.IT still works for my allergies.!but this is the first time that i felt the sides efects this friday the June 5.ihad my yearly shot .i started having stomach problems.plus I`M FELLING depresed I dont know why this year is making me sick.I called the nurse that gave the shot and asked her if this simtoms was from the shot and she said no.what a big lier  ",4
"Well the doctors have not correctly diagnosed my condition yet, but say its ulcerative colitis like symptons, i have used this drug many times usually 40mg then ween down weekly it has worked wonders for me only side effect is that i usually gain 10lbs easily every time i use it but the pros easily out weigh the cons.",5
"Have had chronic hives since I was 14. Now 40 years later, still having them. The prednisone 10mg a day has been the  most  effective. Drs seem resistant to this treatment, but it's the only thing that helps.",5
"I am diabetic,and I work hard to keep it under control,but this has raised my sugar over 200 and it scares me. ",3

Although this drug has side effects.  The benefits out weighed the risk of side effects.  The first day on the medication I had night sweats and couldn't sleep.  By the second day I was able to sleep.  I had sciatic pain and it is almost gone.,5
Edema lower extremities,5
I just started this medicine today for possible Meniere's Disease. Took 4 10mg pills this morning at the same time. DONT DO IT!!! By 8:30am I was twitchy. By 9am I was sweating. Then the heart rate started racing and I couldn't stop shaking. Hot - Cold - Hot - Cold. And I'm at work and I can't get my thoughts together. I'm only on it for 10 days but I'm afraid what I'm going to be like by then....be very careful!!,1
"I was put on this medication for Autoimmune Hepatitus in January at 60 mg a day and have continued taking it at a reduced dose through this month...June.  I was reduced to 20 mg after a month, then 10, and 5 for half of the time I've been on it.  I have now been told my liver levels are at the point that we can begin the slow course of getting off of the medication.  I have had every side effect imaginable including getting every cold and flu imaginable for 2 months straight.  I gained 35+ pounds all around my middle in only 2 weeks and it hasn't come off even with a strict Weight Watchers diet and exercising over an hour every day.  Now that I'm reducing the dose, the weight is starting to come off.  I have been horribly depressed the whole time.  But, all in all, the drug did do as it was supposed to and reduced my liver swelling.  I have been miserable while taking it and am very glad to be off of it soon!",4
"PREDNISONE!I will never forget this steroid. I was 13 at the time and given Prednisone for my kidneys. I stayed on this medication for the whole summer. I remember major ACNE, missing cycles and my stomach blowing up as if I was 5 months pregnant. I remember clear as day. At the tender age of 13, I've gained over 20lbs.I'm now 31 years old and have the stretch marks to show for them. I have them on my ankles, forearm, back of my leg and my waist.Now 31,my primary care tried to put me on them because she thought I may have asthma. I told her I refuse and I have had my fair share of Prednisone. Come to find out, no asthma...just inflammation of the broncchial due to my high blood pressure medicine Lisnipril(causes major coughs). Back to Prednisone, it didn't reverse my kidneys disease. I was told I have to stay on my BP meds in order to not damage the kidneys. In my opinion my Nephrologist back in New York gave me this medication because he thought this may cure everthing. NOT!!! I think they should find other alternative ways besides giving PREDNISONE. Now I'm very wise and if anyone in my family was put on this medication, I would do my own investigation before I would say YES to PREDNisone.",1
Poison Ivy,5
"I have cryoglobulinemia vasculitis have been on pred for over 5 months, started out 60 mg a day down to 20 mg/day for maintainence. Developed pred induced diabetes and hypertension so I monitor my sugar and blood pressure daily.  With the pain I have with the cryo. vas. I will deal with the DM and HTN. I dont have the other systoms I see listed by others and feel if I need to be on this for the rest of my life I will happily do so.",5
i definitely feel better and the dermatitis is clearing up: however i am experincing some irritablity and moodiness.  ,4
"I have taken this medication for my asthma many times. The first time I took it I vowed within the first few hours that I would never take it again. However, as horrible as the side effects are, they do make sense. The point of taking this medication is to put your body into overdrive to heal you as quickly as possible. This creates the fast heart-rate, the hot-flashes, and the annoying exhaustion. However in the end when used properly in the correct situation, it is the MOST effective medicine, this fact completely ecclipses the fact that it can be unpleasant to take. I would rather be hot, tired and crabby and able to breathe, than the opposite.",5
"I'm taking it for a pinched nerve or slipped disc in my lower neck upper back. I'm taking 10mg pills 6 the first day, 5 the second, and so on until out.  Yesturday was my first dose I started getting blurred vison, then came hot flashes/flushed/sweats, my heart was racing and I couldn't stop shaking/pacing for a few hours. Today I took 5 and I'm starting down the same path... blurred vision, hot flashes, and now I'm starting to shake. I don't like the way it makes me feel and can't wait to be finished with it. Still have pain in my right chest and down my arm.",2
"was given this med for lumbar 4-5,bulging disc. took 4 pills/3dys, 3pills/,2pills/1pill,just finished yesterday.  it was tough, pills tasted terrible(please cover them!),then had a weird symptom of not being able to swallow, per pharmacy this is a side affect.  i didn't experience any hyperness, due to morning doses only.  for this back problem i guess it would be 75% ok, now the back dr wants me to take voltaren and it has crazy side affects too.  ",3
"Been on this med several times in the last several months for multiple reasons.  Up until the last week, no major complaints - just made me want to snack more than normal.  In the last week, after having been on 10mg a day for six straight weeks, I've begun having stomach unsettledness along with a noticeable weight gain.  It does help with the joint pain that I had been having as well as helping with breathing issues.",4
NOSE DUE TO ALLERGY,3
feet are swelling,1
"The prednisone did help the contact dermatitis on my upper arm go away alot faster then just you the lotion my doctor prescribed. I am taking one 50 mg dose a day (every night) for five days. Day one I was fine did not notice any side effects. Day two, rapid heart beat, red & hot face, a little paranoid and I feel like my body could jump out of my skin. Day three, I did not take a pill last night. I am in a constant mild panic attack or anxiety attack. My heart is beating a little faster, my face is hot while the rest of my body is freezing. I really hope it does not take days to come down off this medication. I'll never take this again. ",3
"I've been on this medication for 30 years now and have been on 7.5 mg for the past several years.  You just have to control your eating so not to gain the extra weight. Overall, I have been very satisfied.  All drugs have their issues and everyone experiences something different.",5
"The only problem I had while taking this medicine was the taste. If you can get past that, you will be pleasantly surprised with the results.",5
"I'm supposed to be on 60mg/day, but after being on this medication for over a year I decreased my own dose (gradually) to 20mg/day. When I first went on prednisone it was a Godsend, no more pain and little seasonal allergy problems. But over time (and not very much time) my symptoms have outweighed the good things about it. I have gained weight-about 40-50lbs in the last year or so, constant infections due to my decreased immune system, horrible mood swings, retaining fluid like crazy, even my hair is frizzy! If you can do without this drug and take something else do yourself a favor!",4
"I know people hate the side effects, but this drug has really helped me and I got used to the side FX after a while. Been on it for over 4 years. Take a small(5mg)maintenance dose and go up to 30mg when I flare and wean back down when it's time. I am a self medicator as my doc knows I know how to use the drug safely. This is very important! It's time to get off the drug if possible, as I just had part of my kidney removed (cancer) and also have a tumor on my adrenal gland. I also seem to  have ""Addison's like""(not Addison's itself) symptoms(high potassium,low sodium). I want to see if my adrenals will start working for themselves again. I have to warn everybody: you MUST wean off this drug if taken for more than a week or so! Many doctors just have you stop a large dose and that is dangerous! Taking this drug makes your adrenals stop producing cortisol and other adrenal hormones if taken in large enough quantities and for long periods of time. That's why you must wean. I will take months to get off the 5mg I take, as I just got down to 5mg after being up to 20mg. I have 1mg tabs too, so I can do this very slowly and safely. Hopefully my adrenals will start making their own cortisol again. It's a great drug! It just has to be taken correctly if you are a long time user of it. Be careful if you are. Sorry for the book. LOL",5
BAD DRUG! i was prescribed prednisone after an allergic reaction at work. 80mg daily (spread into 4 doses) after one day i started experiencing symptoms of psychosis. i felt like i was being watched and i couldnt function. i got in my car to drive to the dr office and freaked out. i had a nervous break down at work and was scared of everyone and everything. horrid drug. didnt help at all. i was told i needed therapy to overcome the situation. sometimes i still freak out when i pass by my old job..,1
When I take prednisone in the A.M. it makes me foggy headed  until late in the day.  Would it be better to take it at night?,1
"It really controlled my asthma exacerbation well, but made me very wired to the point of not being able to sleep. After being on 80 mg a day, my doctor gradually reduced the dosageover a period of about 4 or 5 days.  However, I stopped cold turkey and suffered the withdrawal which I tolerated better than going without sleep for days. ",5
"I had severe asthma, like I had't had in years.  It was very difficult for me to breathe, my chest hurt and even felt a little swollen.  My lungs were definately swelled up.  It was so difficult for me to breathe that I was having constant anxiety attacks.  I felt very ill, and since I dislike going to the clinic I decided to wait and let it go away on its own.   I waited about a week before I ended up having to go to the E.R.  There I was given an nebulized albuterol treatment and the first dose of the prednisone.  Well, maybe after about 3 or 4 doses of the med. I felt a significant difference.",5
"Iam 55 years old and it took all the pain out of my joints so i could be productive at work and home physically. The down side is, that is a one time prescription, and my joint pain has returned!",5
"I'm on 20 mg daily.  Weight gain is the biggest drawback (1st time 40 lbs in 3 months, this time over 25 in 5 months).  Moon face, irritability, mood swings, sweating, ankle/foot and hand/wrist swelling, tire easily.  Had to have surgery in March this year but the surgeon didn't find anything significant to remove, so only took out the appendix.  I was told there was a possible fistula and the ileum was narrowed (I had a small bowel camera scope and the camera got stuck for several hours), but she didn't find anything when she got in there.  I'm now on Humira (started in April) with no improvement and my dr started me on Lialda, with no improvement.  Won't take me off the prednisone for fear of making things worse, like they aren't bad now.  Diarrhea daily since (and before) the surgery.  Crohn's sucks and so does prednisone.  I wouldn't recommend it unless absolutely necessary.  Email me if you have any questions, [email protected]",1
i have had hives for a week now and my doc has had me on prednizone for over four months for my allergies they just uped my dosage from 30 mlg a day to 40,2

I was dignosed as having a mini-stroke and put on 60 mg/day of prednisone for 2 weeks until test and temple arterie biopsy could be performed.  The medication worked well with no side effects. I am now on decresing dosages to finish the treatment.,5
Just started prednisone for back pain.  The doctor things i have strained lumbar muscles.  I am put on it for seven days. My concern is stopping cold turkey.I was not told to slowly go off of this. Will this bother me? I read these side effect its kind of mind bottling. The pharmacist said that the short time i am on this it should not have any effect on me.,3
nervousness and sleep problems,4
you have to have a very strong sleeping are it is very hard to deal with these pills.  when these pills get fully in your blood get ready to swet alot at night. coming down off of them is no picnic either.  ,5
"It has helped with the skin rash and blisters, but the side effects are horrible. After 2 weeks (one to go), I have experienced depression, weight gain, rapid heart beat, panic attacks, lack of ability to concentrate. Not just moderate, but severe. I will not drive unless I must while I am on this medication. If I had to do it all ove again, I would put up with the pain of my consition and not the awful side effects. Can't wait until I am off this horrible stuff.",3
dont like the drug but my family had seen great  improvent in me but i get so sleepy after taking the med,3
"I take this drugs every month for 6 days I found a great improvement on my symptoms. It does put a little weight on but its worth it just need to do a little exercise if possible. This drug leaves a very horrible taste in your mouth so the best thing to take it with is milk only it leaves no taste at all! I tried juices, coffee, cokes and tea and nothing works as good as milk! it also takes away immflamation and poor circulation, Good Luck!",4
"I take this medication for COPD, severe right sciatica nerve pain, severe right eye pain and Fibromyalgia. This really helps the pain in my siatica nerve and COPD although it has put quite a few pounds on me.",3
does prednisone have amphetamines in it?   good expierence,5
"My doctor prescribed this medication to treat inflammation resulting from Bronchitis, which remained long after the infection had cleared, and was aggravated by seasonal allergies. On day 5 of a 9-day treatment, I feel fantastic. My breathing is very relaxed, and I am having no more spasms. I did not experience any side effects. I will say that my sister's long-term treatment with this drug for her chron's disease (which was a mis-diagnosis) went horribly. She looked pregnant, her entire body was swollen, and she became extremely hairy. My personal experience using it as a short-term treatment for breathing difficulty has been very positive. For the record, the pills could use to be coated, if it's possible with this medication. The pills leave a taste in  your mouth like the stuff they put in the special nail polish to stop nail biting and thumb sucking, and drinking doesn't clear it out.",5
Get the Gout often in my hands and feet. Prednisone works in 2 days and pain and swelling are gone.,5
your body blows up,4
"prednisone-- I had to take it for 2 10-day cycles... on the second cycle I was just too tired... too hungry... too close to depressed bad... my heartbeat would race feeling like anxiety attacks... not able to sleep well... felt shaky and unusual..... told my Doctor... but assured me that the dosage I was taking was too low to cause withdrawals... have since been put back on naproxen.... medicines don't always work the same for everyone..... this one was not good for me, too many side effects... not able to get better cause I was to busy reacting from the meds.... listen to your body whenever you take meds... only you know for sure if it is good for you.",2
"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis a couple months ago.  Started taking 40mg of prednisone a day.  I have been weaning off it slowly ever since.  I had a few minor side effects (increased hunger and heartburn, as well as dizziness when working out) but that's about it.  I started to find myself gaining a bit of a belly - and keep in mind that I have been active my whole life and am only 22 years old.  To anyone taking this medication, I would say that it is imperative that you workout at least 3 days a week.  If not, you are most likely going to gain weight.  The ""increased appetite"" side effect doesn't help either!  So make sure you drink lots of fluids and keep active while on prednisone.  But all in all, this drug has been amazing for me!  My UC was almost totally cleared up within a few days of taking it.  The bloody diarrhea, cramps and frequent BMs stopped after around the 4 day mark.  To anyone taking prednisone, I hope you have a similar, positive experience as well.",5
Took this drug for 3 years due to severe polymyalgia.In and out of remission over the last 3 years.No side effects.

It works great for some and is so wrong for others.  ,5

swollen neck,2
This is a dangerous drug for many of us. The side effects have left me sicker than my diagnose. This drug needs to be removed from exsitant. Many people don't realize the seriousness of the side effect and don't even know they are having side effects. They think the side effects are just another condition. Thank god I listened to my body and investigated this drug. If you are taking this drug please pay attention to how your body is feeling and get off it.,1

"I have had UC for 10 years now and have been on and off prednisone.  I only take it when I go out of remission.  I'm out of remission at the moment and have been the last 4 months taking 40mg. of prednisone.  It used to work for me in the past, but it's not working for me now.  I hate the side effects also...I have severe acne, ""moon"" face, unwanted facial hair growth, sleeplessness/tiredness, weight gain etc... It really affects my self esteem and looks.",3

"Have been prescribed this in a 3 to 4 day dosage after bad bouts of allergy-induced asthma.  Refused to take it any more after my second course of medication.  Made my heart race, I also couldn't sit still-- I felt like I constantly had to be in motion - paced a lot and would shake if I tried to sit still.    In recent years, I went on oral contraceptives, and will not take prednisone if prescribed to me as it can cause a sever, potentially fatal interaction with my oral contraceptive.",3

Took prednisone along with other immosuppressives. Most noticable effects were occasional blurring vision. Also some breakout of pimples on my back. Started a 60 mg daily and am now off completely. But am experiencing some withdrawal symptoms such as calf and thigh pains.,4
Began taking prednisone when I had difficulty with everyday tasks.  At first the 40mg kept me awake for 72 hours but gradually reduced to 10mg per day and for the most part I am at least 75% better.  Still have flare ups but increase doseage for awhile and then decrease again.  Couldn't do without.,5
"drug was the only thing that worked,using 20mg twice a day when there is a frare-up pain 75% gone by 6hours will use for no more than 4 days.The pain in my knee and ankles was an 8 on scale to 1 to 10.45 yrs old,6'4"",270#s ",5
"The 2+weeks of feeling bad, heartburn, indigestion, out of body feeling, emotional highs/lows, hunger that lasted the entire time, and more feelings were just NOT worth it for me at all. I've done Remicade, Methotrexate, etc, and would do them again before the PRED. Kathy inb Utah",2
"unable to sleep.very angry.extreme weight gain.swelling all over the body.water retention.bruising easily , from just taking blood pressure .uncontrollable hunger.started on 60 mg then down to 5 mg taking each dose for 7 days, was far too long as had been diagnosed with Lupus and tests results came back it was not Lupus and was told I could not ""just quit taking the steroid"".Will never take it again",1
"I have taken Prednisone for 24 years. I currently take 12 mg per day and this seems to keep flare ups of Crohns, Lupus and muscle pain in check. I also had a Liver transplant 19 years ago and this is a maintenance drug to say the least. My only complaints are the weight gain, bloating, insomnia, restlessness and teeth pain. You take the good with the bad and being alive and active is the better deal. When I try to reduce dosage, I get the flare ups and a larger temp dosage is always needed. Try to avoid if possible, but it does work.",5
"with asthma that is not able to be controlled the first few times you use this you will think it is a wonder drug. Fifteen years down the road it is a living hell of a treatment, side affects get worse  each time and the drug worse less and less to help the breathing. Im not sure which is going to kill me first, the asthma or the meds.  It takes a supreme effort and will to just make it through thhe burst, at one point I am always so weak and sleep deprived that it is hard not to will myslef to just die. If you can avoid this drug do so at all costs. what seems like a blessing used once is going to kill you over a period of years. ",3
"I have polymalgia and my upper arms,neck and shoulders hurt me for months. Started Predisone in Sept at 40mgs now I am weaning down to 6 next week 5.  I did gain weight and lots of puffiness. As I wean down I feel like I'm on a roller coaster,one minute I'm fine the next I am crying hysterically...someone looks at me funny and I start crying...is this part of the weaning down or do I have another problem?  The pred. competely removed my pain.",5
"In October I was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica.  I suffered with pain in the muscles of my legs, arms and neck.  I was put on prednisone starting with a dose of 40 mg daily.  I am now on 10 mg per day and also Celebrex every other day.  I have severe depression, facial swelling and have gained 10 lbs in 6 months.  It has helped my symptoms but the side effects are very unpleasant.  I work full time and it makes it very difficult to function feeling this way-almost like a zombie.",5
"I haven't finished the full treatment, but I had an allergic reaction to Ms Clairol Black Hair Dye, caused a rash all over my body, didn't realize when I showered it flowed over my body. It was like have chix pox or measles. So far so good..I am really scared of taking any medicines especially one like this. But it helped with the hives/rash and the itching.",4
Upset my nerivious system gave me thrush of the mouth that all the skin came off inside my mouth.,3

"i was taking 10mgs a day and it was great i had ton of energy my stiffness totally went away but then i couldn't go to sleep i would wide a wake all night, then i gained about 20 pounds while taking this medication, i told my Dr. i did'nt want to take it anymore, if was going to continue to gain weight, i rather suffer the pain, so i was weened off this med, i still have joint stiffness but there has to be some ther kind of meds to feel relief without the weight gain and lack of sleep. ",4
"i have been on this medication for 9 years now for kidney disease and i HATE it. i take 60mg every other day. i have gained 40+ ibs, cant sleep, joint and muscle pain and have had the flu 3 times this year. my condition isnt getting better either. its very up and down",3
"I have been on pred for 8-9 years now.  It began to make a big difference in my life after only 1 week.  I had less pain, less swelling, a better outlook on life, and finally, some energy!  I was on 20 mg for several years.  My doc wanted me to decrease the dose by 5 mg every 3-4 days until I got to 5 mg.  I knew what wouldn't be pleasant, and I stretched the reduction over several months.  I had no withdrawal symptoms. I now stay on 5 mg.  When I had surgery recently I found I definitely needed a stress dose, as I became ""wiggy"", worried, and weepy until I took it.  There are some negative side effects when this drug is taken long-term, especially in large doses. Yet it helps me when, and like, nothing else does.   ",5
"Ihave completed my corse of treatment and I have sever pain all over my body. Pain swallowing, skin is super sensitive to the touch, joints all ache.",5
Showed effects within one week.,4
"I have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Although this medicationhelped ease the pain, the side effects have been a pharmacutical roller coaster ride from hell. I'm still trying to decide which is worse!!!",5
I was on a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that did nothing for me.  My regular MD prescribed Prednisone for me and I had immediate (within 4 hours) improvement.  I have nothing but positive to say about it.,5
"I have been taking Prednisone 25mg for approx 2 months daily for a severe asthma attack...  I am experiencing almost every side effect associated with Prednisone use.  I do not believe the drug is working well, and will soon request to be taken off the drug.  I attempted to cease the use of this medication on my own and was faced with severe withdrawel symptoms.  I would not reccomend long term use of this medication.",3
"I take prednisone only occasionally, usually after a severe asthma attack or if I tell my doctor that my asthma is not under control.  Since it is for only six days at a time, I don't really worry about the side effects of an oral steroid as I would if I took it daily.  The one REALLY bad thing about it is that after a day or two of taking it, the pain in my arms, or bones in my arm, is very severe when I cough.  That goes away in a day or two after I stop, so I guess it is worth it, but the pain is excrutiating.",5
"I was prescribed prednisone for ulcerative colitis and I feel completely horrible now that my treatment is done!!! I took 40mg a day for 7 days and now my bones, muscles, skin hurt severely!! I would rather deal with a flare up than the withdrawls of this medication. So not only is my diesease frustrating now I have to deal with this medication which adds pain on top of everything else!!! Don't take this pill people!!!",2
I have had this atopic dermatitis for about 30 years. I often itch and scratch till I bleed. Wake at night itching like crazy. This is the only thing which is easy to use and works like magic. Itching is gone and skin is starting to heal the first days. Side affects -- Zero -- unless you count feeling more energetic. I take a decreasing dosage when it flares up real bad. This about 20 times a year.,5
skin rash,1
"This med made me feel terrible the entire time I took it over a 7 day period.  It helped clear up the problem, but if you have insomnia issues also,be prepared to take a sleeping pill.",3
"Diagnosed with bell's palsy. This drug was a horrible experience. It took care of the problem, but the side effects were terrible. I had severe bloating, water retention when stopping this drug. Neck pain came back severly. While taking it I gained 10 lbs. in the whole 10 days prescribed. I had terrible sleep! Up all hours, over exhausted! Also wanting to eat eat eat constantly!",5
I feel better when taking prednisone.  Sometimes when I stop taking this medication I become very cranky and irritable for a few days.,5
Constant weight gain,4
"my body would shake after taking this medicine, I felt liking a racing car going 200 mph throughout my body. I have hard time sleeping at night but most of all they have a bitter taste.",4
Has always helped with symptoms and outbreaks of my rheumatoid arthritis.,5
"I am a 38 year old female who was diagnosed with severe asthma at age 3. I am now having a terrible time losing weight and my doctors have attributed this difficulty to the build up and repeated use of Prednisone in my system. Please, if you are a young person using this drug, investigate the side effects and what it can do to you as you grow older. I am trying to lose weight and Prednisone increases appetite which contributes to weight gain. I would not recommend it to ANYONE and have already told my doctors that, the next time I have a severe asthma attack, I want to be hospitalized on IVs rather than given an course of oral steroids. They gave me this drug throughout my life but never told me (or my parents) about the long term side-effects. Be smart and STAY AWAY FROM IT!!! (I wish I had learned this sooner...)",5
"i was given prednisone and zpac for sinusitis. 20mg twice a day. the first dose i took at 9pm. i cleaned the whole house, did laundry, and fixed things. It made my sinuses clear up quick. i couldnt sleep. i was up every hour. when i fell asleep i had crazy dreams. the next day i took one before work and was wired through the whole shift till 3am. i am not taking it tonight. i think i will take one early tommorrow if i can sleep tonight. if i dont sleep tonight i am calling the pharmacy or doctor tommorrow. he also gave me cough medicine that should have knocked me out and it didnt stand a chance next to this stuff. i wish i would have read all these comments before taking it. i really dont feel like myself. i like all the energy but its kind of a scary drug. when i get sick i like to be able to rest to get better. this stuff doesnt let you. i am a 28 yr old male.",2
"I am on it for a flare up of Ulcerative Colitis.  It worked wonders when I was on 4 pills a day and then 3 pills a day.  Im on 2 pills a day now, Im starting to feel extreme triedness and not sleeping well. UC is still under control though.",5
"My husband started Prednisone for a inflammed rotar cuff, He became very agitated, couldnt sleep at night so very tired during day, felt very bloated all the time, hated this drug.",3
"This is THE WORST DRUG I have ever taken. I have had extreme severe headaches that have gone undiagnosed for 30 plus days. The side effects of prednisone was absolutely awful. I took 60mg today and I will NOT touch it again! in fact its already been flushed. Extreme anxiety, restlessness, nervousness, angry mood swings, weird vision, pacing, I GO TO BED AT 10;00pm it is now 3;00am. If feel like im on speed or meth. I was on percocet and was taken off due to its ""addictive properties"" Ill tell you now that i would rather have been addicted to pain medication and go through withdrawals then to have ever touched this crap. To be honest I have been through opiate withdrawals before and it is much simpler and only lasts a few days. Pain medicine is truly a godsend it helped me with my anxiety, depression, and pain. All the problems I had were gone. Doctor's are evil and seem to enjoy watching people suffer just to protect their own butt. I would rather have severe headaches then to take this stuff. And its funny that 9 out 10 reviews were awfully negative and i read them AFTER i had taken the prednisone. DRUGS FROM THE 1950's should be banished from the market FOR GOOD.   ",2
"Been taking it off and on for over a year. Got diagnosed with asthma and COPD when I was 20. Advair, Albuterol, and Symbicort didn't seem to help my beathing at all compaired to prenidsone. I HATE the side effects though. Whenever I have a flare up or lung infection I get put on a huge dose, generally around 60-80 and slowly tappered down. Take half in the morning, and half at night. If my condition hasn't improved, I'll be stuck on 20 for a few weeks to months. The side effects get even worse! Every bone and joint in my body is in terrible pain, some days I don't want to get out of bed. I'm either always hungry, or not at all. Weird mood swings. Bad dreams. Swollen puffy face and body. (Water pills help get rid of the water puffyness fast!! But not the swollen face...I lost 10 lbs in one week after stopping prednisone this last time from the water pills. The face swelling hurts like heck, the back of my neck and head and shoulders get hard, lumpy, and painful...etc.   Overall, I love how it makes me feel for the first 2 weeks, and after that I just want to cry. It's the only thing that helps though, so i'm either stuck with terrible side effects and being able to breathe...or gasping for air even trying to hold up a conversation. ",5
"I took prednisone for tracheitis (not asthma I only chose asthma because I myself am an asthmatic and I could not choose tracheitis). I disliked how long it took for the drug to cure the inflammation, which took place over a period of roughly 5 weeks. And now after the fact I'm seriously depressed, have been having mood swings, restless, hallucinations,weight gain over a period of time, weight loss over a period of time, increased thirst, insomnia, dizziness, confusion ect. The list goes on and on and that was only about half of it. I was happy with being able to now run track since I've been cured, but the depression and stress on top of the experiances listed above (and those not listed) is just too much. I despise this drug.",4
"this drug is very effective in treating lung inflammation, weight gain and moon face will occur, THIS DRUG CAN CAUSE EXTREME MOOD SWINGS ranging from feeling grandiose to being incredibly hostile and angry, I have underestimated these side effects at times and have been dismissed from two jobs for bizarre behavior, anyone prone to anxiety or anger or mood instability should use this medicine with extreme caution and you may want to consider avoiding stressful situations (work, job interviews ect) until the cycle is completed",4
"I have been on and this medication since 1981. It works wonders I really don't like the weight gain 10 pounds in 6 months, and the semi moon face isn't great but it is better than the Hives.",5
"I was prescribed this drug for pain in the joint of my shoulder.  I was only on it for 2 days before getting an incredible amount of relief. I do have a lot of energy, and was unaware of the suggestion to take it early in the morning...GOOD IDEA! After taking it that way, I was able to sleep well & had increased energy during the day.",5
COPD-  three times-inflamed lungs,4
"Because I was prescribed this so often, I have had a complete shutdown of my adrenal gland.  I now have to take meds the rest of my life to prevent a life threatening illness.  I know so many people being given this for various illness and pain and you do feel great when you take it...but this particular side effect is something doctors don't tell you about, and it can happen very quickly.  BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS DRUG.",5
"My son has severe asthma everytime he's on it his face swells, his legs hurt and he has bad mood swings! ",3
This is my 2nd time on pred...on 80 mgs 1st time 5 years ago and I felt like supergirl...I had so much energy i required little sleep and boy did my house stay spotless...after a while my face did begin to swell ..but thats is it...I ate constantly and ate tons..but didnt gain any weight...probably cuz I remained so active!!! after feeling sick so long this time I am looking forward to that energy again and feel so sorry for the people on here who have had such a negative experience! this time I am only on 60 mgs...and only on 2nd dose...so hope all goes well!anything is better to me than all the blood loss and stomach pain I experience.,5
HAVE BEEN HAVING HEAD TO TOE HIVES FOR MONTHS THE Pren IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS. HAVE BEEN ON LOTS OF OTHER MEDS WITH NO LUCK  I GAINED A LITTE WEIGHT BUT OTHER WISE FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS HAD SOME BAD SIDE EFFECTS AT FIRST BUT LOSE DOSE DAILY IS AWESOME FOR ME  NEVER FELT BETTER WITH THEM.,5
"Very effective for those who can tolerate it. I am super sensitive to ANY steroid, which makes me have a high heart rate and generally panic. This has been great for my family members though, who tolerate the drug perfectly well. ",4
This has been a life saver for asthma. I've used since I was little kid and have never had any problems. I may have mild mood swings or get a little hungry but that's about it. I still take a child's dose 30 years later. A little can go a long way. I only use it in short bursts. I had to take a stronger dose a few years when I had terrible bronchitis. It worked wonders and got me back to normal. My child just took it this week and he did well on it. It helped him loosen congestion within hours. He was on a dose but it worked along with the albuterol neb. He did eat more but I wasn't concerned since he only took it for 3 days. It brought my happy baby back.,5
"I have fibro,chronic fatigue,degenerative disc disease,ptsd,ibs,chronic headache/migraines and myofacial pain syndrome.I had 2 knee surgeries (menesetomies )left knee followed by chronic muscle pain and inflamation around the knee cap and muscle behind the knee. My ortho put me on a short regime of prednisone (30mg for 3 days,20mg for 3 days,10mg for 3 days). These were the best,most pain free,energetic days I have had since my diagnosies. I found that the   10mg days were the best as far as hyperactivity,headache and sleeping ability. I would like to find a doctor willing to work with me on a low dose (10mg )daily regime for 6 mos. and then ceck for side effects or problems mentioned in your evaluation of this med.",5
"I have a bad flare up of my arthritis once or twice a year.  I have found that this medication, even with the side effects, is very beneficial.  I have experienced 5-10 lb wgt gain at times (easily lost after therapy is completed), increased mood swings and anger, and some difficulty with sleep.  The ability to carry on with my daily activities, pain free, far outweighs the temporary side effects of this drug.",5
"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!! I was diagnosed with Nephrotic Syndrome in Nov 07. My Nephrologist put me on Prednisone, it did not stop/slow down my swelling. As a matter of fact it made it worst. I was depressed and gained 50lbs in 2 months. I had moon-face(where my face becomes really round), mood swings, trouble breathing, because of the lowering of my immune system i was constantly sick. It did not help in any possible way other than to make me miserable. I hated taking it so much. I stopped cold turkey and took my chances. Other than a little heartburn I did not experience any problems. After stopping Prednisone I lost 30lbs in a month!",1
"Took a 5 day regimen of this drug. it cleared up the problem but left me feeling very fatigued, slightly dizzy at times,irratible.  Not sure how long this stays in your system.",4
"After reading some of these reviews it scared me. But, only after a few days on this drug I'm amazed at the effectiveness of the drug. I spent a month and a half in shear agony I went to an ENT and gave me prednisone with a nasal spray. My sinus condition has cleared up my lower back pain is gone (not related to my seeking help) and my foot pain, also not related is gone. The only problem I have is I'm feeling bloated and not eating any more than usual.The first day I felt muscle weakness in my legs, but that has gone away. I'm on a 18 day regime @ 20 mg tablet. Hopefully the bloating will go away after I'm done with the medication ... I feel like a human again!",4
"after taking this for the first time, i was more afraid of the side effects, with HBP.. so i did my part, and started losing weight, eating the foods low in purines, and much more green foods, it works better if you help it, and you will see BETTER results, i did.. ",5

"My docotor gave me Pred during a major allergy flare up (it was ugly). It really perked me up and got the rash, sneezing, coughing, water eyes, etc under control.

I am still stuffy and can't sleep at night. The purpose was not taken care of.,1
I have diiiculty breathing while taking this medication.  I also have trouble sleeping,2

"Took this for an allergic reaction to yellow fever vaccine. Felt terrible for days, sweats, joint pain and visual problems, called md said it was from the prednisone to continue taking but I stopped at 40mg day the side effects were worse than imagined. I am a nurse and took the chance that the abrupt stopping the meds would be better than the actual benefit from the drug.  Will never take again!",1
It is making me super nervous and angry,5
Had l5 removed from spine.  Intro of the medication had little if no effect.  I remain in worse chronic pain after 3 years after surgery & treatment,1
It worked great. But I have side effects that are really painful.,5
"this medication has caused me to have severe heartburn, even though i took it with food.",3
"secondary to unknown skin condition, the prednisone lowered by immune system which allowed my condition to get worse as well as complicate my condition w/ a secondary infection.",1
This med has been helpful when I have a bad flare up.  I've been on Enbrel for 5 years which has really helped but when I get nearly unable to walk I can handle the side effects for short periods.,4
"I get into serious problems when my asthma attacks get out of hand. I also get pneumonia quickly. My Doctor has to take an agressive approach with me. This drug when needed works great. I would not recommend this for asthma that can be controlled with inhalers,but for severe attacks I highly recommend it.",5
"I have been on Prednisone several different times, for two different afflictions ,Colitis & Hip/Joint injury.

I am on my 2nd day and am experiencing tremors fatigue and extreme bone/joint pain.  It alleviated the swelling in my throat which I am thankful for, but am afraid to take anything to help with the pain.  I was told this could leach the potassium out of my blood and was given a potassium suppliment in the ER, so the pain may be from a lack of potassium, but if it were going to be so pronounced I would have thought they would have told me to take a potassium suppliment while on the drug.  Can't wait to get off this junk!",4

I traded IBD for weight gain, depression, and joint stifness, I fought back with excersice though and have lost the 40 lbs i put on plus another 40 that I needed to lose anyways.

I had graves thyroid ablated 10 yrs ago and was told i'd be fine but now there trying to say my side effects are from my thyroid. But yet i continue to have blood and protein in my urine i wonder if they will associate that with my thyroid also. Any Dr. out there with a little help on this subject feel free to comment. I've already been to almost every specialist there is but AM not getting better so BEWARE the wonder of prednisone and do your research before taking this drug!!!!!!!",1

I am diabetic and this steroid caused my blood sugar to go so high I had to use insulin and after nearly 3 years I'm still on insulin.  I was previously on pills and diet/exercise.  I was being treated for breathing problems from having the flu.  It also caused me to having crying spells I would describe as depression and somewhat neurotic as I schemed and plotted a way to get groceries etc.,5
I have taken prednisone for 15 years for RA and very satisfied.i have tried all other treatment but none worked.now i am taken gold inj but it dont seem to work either.I have a few minor side effects but nothing compared to the pain and swelling i have without prednisone.I have more good days than bad and will probably take it for the rest of my life!,5
"I have ITP - a platlett disorder - I recently had to have back surgery so in order to boost my platlett count I was put on 60 mg a day for 2 weeks. Which it has now been 6 wks. I did have a platlett increase but the side effects have been weight gain, loss of sleep. I am being weined off now - I have had some swelling of the eye, mouth, rashes in varies places on my body.",3
"I have been put on prednison for Ulcerative colitis. I have night sweats, mood swings and increases hunger. I gained a lot of weight the first time I was prescribed it 6 years ago, but that was also a much high dose. The 60 lbs of water weight and extra calorie consumption I gained over the year of treatment came off pretty quickly after I was taken off it. This time my UC symptoms have started to calm down and it does give me hope that maybe it will put me in remission for awhile. The medication is hard on the body, but it does work. For the hunger I snack on veggies to help with weight (so far) and for the mood swings I just try to remember that this isn't me and to breath through it. As for the night sweats, keep a change of clothes out, and sleeping on a towel helps to keep the bed dry. (gross, I know, but waking up to wet sweaty sheets is not something I wish on anyone.) Good luck and hang in there to anyone on this medication, it's a double edged sword.",4
"I've had a very different experience then many of the other posts.  I was diagnosed with a relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia back in December and within 48 hours of starting the Prednisone, it  had me breathing without any difficulty.  After four weeks, my chest x-ray was completely normal.  Given the choice between struggling to breath or taking steroids,  I choose the steroids.  I have been on Prednisone for 6 weeks - starting at 60 mg. and now tapered to 20 mg.  I try to walk everyday and have gained a few pounds anyway.  I still have night sweats.  I'm grateful for this drug; however, I want to taper-off as quickly as is possible while staying symptom free.  ",5
this drug is very addictive.has many side effects.cannot stop taking or symptoms will return.,3
"I have been taking Prednisone on and off for a few months. I am currently in the middle of a 30-day course of 40 mgs a day to help boost my organs after a severe internal infection. I hate how this drug makes me feel. I have had weight gain, stomach irritation and burning, insomnia, restlessness, muscle pain and vomiting. In the past my internal infection has gotten better but soon return after stopping the Prednisone I am back to having pain. I am hoping my strong 30 day dose will take it away for good, if so these darn side effects will I guess be worth it.",4
"I was diagnosed with the disease over 10 years ago and remember hating this drug so much that I rectally bleed and have cramps like Im in labor and always bad diarreah...but refused to go to the doctor because I hate this drug so much Id rather be in pain I guess.  The side affects were just so damn bad, muscle cramps, weight gain, round face, mood changes, etc...  Its awful, I was hoping times had changed and there might be a different drug out there, but by reading the reviews I guess not.  Oh well...",4
"I was given this medicine to control a flare up. I didn't gain weight but I was always hungry, had mood swings, night sweats and couldn't sleep.  As soon as I started tapering down & came off the medicine my flare up was back as bad as it was before. Now my doctor will not do anything for me because my colonoscopy was normal while on this drug. I'm in the process of getting a second opinion. But in the meantime I get to deal with being sick.",3
"Prednisone, along with plaquenil and methotrexate help me to be able to function and for that I am thankful.  Have severe RA.  However, the prednisone has certain side effects that I suffer with.  Cause cataracts to grow more rapidly and I have curved optic nerves and am a candidate for glaucoma which the prednisone contributes to also.  However, I only take 5 mg. a day.  Was told by my RA physician to take 2 or 3 on flare up days, but rarely do this because the side effects (weight gain, eye problems, etc.) are so prevalent.  Yet, must weigh this against not being able to move at all.",5
"This medication stopped my rectal bleeding and diarhea, however now I am confined to my home because of leg pain and general weekness.  ",5
weight gain i want to lose weight but still use the drug for treatment,2
"Prednisone was used to treat a Brown Recluse spider bite.  It has been almost 9 months, and the bite is about healed, but now there is an eruption to the side of the initial wound.  It has been suggested that the eruption may be a boil caused by the reduction of prednisone.  The frustration in this situation is extremely frustrating",3
in process of lowering dosage from 5 to 2 per day.  pain is worse.  fear i may have to increase dosage again.,3
I have to tell you I was afraid of this medicine after I read all the aboves stories but I am here to tell you that I do not have any of those systems. I have been on it for two weeks and am taking 20MG a day.  Please don't be afraid it works different for all.  Good Luck.,4
"Have had Upper Respiratory, Bronchitis, Pneumonia for 3 months new Dr. prescribed 'burst' with Albuterol, Sinus 'Mist' Steroid, STRONG antibiotic (forgot name 2000mg) and Asmanex... Don't know what or combination but, no appetite, only ate 1x a day last 3 days, cramping feet, sensitive skin..esp armpit area?, and WIRED like I am hopped up on a GALLON of coffee!!! After being wiped out for months now, I am like a man on a mission, feel incredible and would have loved this months ago, Christmas would have been nicer... Hoping facial swelling/wt gain doesn't occur but easy breathing and energy is well worth it so far... will update once done with course....",5
"I gained 30 lbs in about 3 weeks. My face was swollen and hurt to the touch. My bowel movements slowed down but the mood swings, hair growth, and weight gain was barely worth the outcome. After i stopped the med the weight gain was still there along with the swollen face for at least 3 weeks. But the bowel movements and pain were back the next day....",4
"I have viral induced asthma.  Last year I was diagnosed with walking pnemounia and was put on albuterol and prednisone.  The drugs had a bad reaction and I had a major attack.  I was told that only 5% of people on both have the same reaction.  If you can, try to get by on just the albuterol every four hours.",3
"I have a love/hate relationship with this drug.  My disease feels so much better when I take it; but I've gained 75 pounds, and my depression has worsened (yet some days I'm almost euphoric).  It's a strange drug....one I can't live without and can't live with.  Definately one that you don't want to take unless you absolutely need it!!",5
I have sufferd terrible heart burn and pain in my chest,3
I have an auto-immune nerve condition called mononeuritis multiplex which is very painful and very much limited the use of my hands. Started on 50mg of Prednisone for a few months and it was helpful in stabilizing my condition and returning some strength to my hands. Began taking Imuran and slowly weaning off prednisone. When I finally got to 5mg per day I started getting almost delusional. I sometimes could not separate reality from thoughts that were going thru my mind that were far from reality. Hard to explain. Very scary though and began questioning my sanity. Have gone back to 10 mg per day and these sensations have gone or mostly gone at any rate. I've had lots of the physical side effects but it is this loss of touch with reality that really frightens me. Has anyone else had this sense of losing touch. Is this a withdrawl problem? Hope someone can answer as this is frightening. Thanks.,3
"This is the drug from hell. I urge everyone to ask there Dr if there might be another drug you can take. The hallucinations were not worth the cure!!! Evil, Evil Drug.",4
"I was admitted to the hospital with acute onset of hemolytic anemia w/ 6.1 HBG and was started on the iv steriods moving to the 60 ml oral when I was released 12 days later after three blood transfusions...and dr is decreasing dose based on blood tests each week as able. It is easy to take but its the side effects that have given me the greatest challenges.  No strenght or endurance through out the day; Hard to stay focused on more than one thing at a time; Lack of sleep; mood swings; stomach pain; but most of all is the incredible swings in my sugar levels waffeling between the low 80's to the very high 500+. As my prednisone dose has gone down the only real change from above I noticed is that the sugar levels are dropping mid 200 to 300's. I have drastically changed my diet to cutting out all sugar and carbs to try and help cut back on the insulin swing doses still required up to 4 times a day. I can deal with the moon face. Would love to figure out how to not be so winded, tired and just exhausted when I do the simplist of task! The symptoms overall are the same with alot less sleeping for me unfortunately. Sounds like its going to be a long haul as they try and figure out what caused it.  Now if the body holds out for the long run!  Keeping the faith. ",3
"prednisone caused a rise in blood pressure, rashes over different parts of the body, and inflamation of the underarms. It is some mean stuff.",2
Took this in conjunction with the antibiotic Avelox.  The prednisone gave me the hiccups for 3 days and I couldn't sleep.  I was miserable.  The combination of the two drugs made my feet/ankles swell.,2
"I take prednisone to treat ulcerative colitis.  However, even though prednisone has saved my life several times by putting me back in remission, I have reached the point where the side effect of DEPRESSION is so bad that we are now looking at other options.  I wanted to make sure that people who are taking prednisone (and their family members) are aware that the depression can be more deadly than the underlying disease.  I have had multiple suicide attempts when on higher doses of prednisone, so patients and their families should be very aware of the risk, which sometimes arises quickly.  It is a chemical reaction that cannot be ""shaken off"" or otherwise managed by trying to block it out.  The prescribing physician will be aware of the side effect and will work with you to determine an alternative treatment for the underlying condition.  ",4
"Six years ago I had a spleenectomy due low platelet count and to lack of response to  prednisone.  A few weeks ago my platelets plunged to a dangerously low level which caused me to have to be hospitalized and subscribed prednisone. The doctors started me on 80mg and is now reducing the dosage because I have double the platelets (the predinisone is working).  Initially, prednisone gave energy, now I am extremely fatigured all day living in a cloudy fog, constant headache, blurred vision in one eye, occassional stomach ache, constant hunger, feeling of floating when I walk, pasty, numb tongue - food taste the same.  No weight gain due to low fat diet (lots of fruits and veggie smoothies in the blender, beans, multi-grains, etc.).  Taking plenty of Calcium and bone health.  I am a Amyway/Global rep and these products worked very well for me the last time I was on prednisone.  No bone loss.  Despite the side effects, the medication seems to be working.  It's hard to tell what might happen with ITP.  I am prayerful and hopeful that I will be weaned off prednisone with a normal platelet count.  Hope this helps someone. ",4
"This drug has horrible sideeffects, but I can't walk, work or care for self wihout it.The downfalls are many..I wonder if it is worth the swelling,exstreme moodiness,depression,wieghtgain,which is bad for all the lower joints...swelling in hands,face,oh yea...after 10 yrs off and on this drug starting out on 60 mlgs a day to 25 a day now I have menstal problems and may have to take birth control.MY tubes are tied!!!Or I may go into early menopause.I am 35 TOO soon.

"I have asthma,empysema & COPD.  Whenever I get an flare up or infection my doctor puts me on a 42 pill regiment- 6 pills (60mg) for 2 days, 5 pills (50mg) for 2 days etc.  I have gained over 60 lbs since my first use.  I would like the dr to address the weight issue.  I get breathless cuz I feel too heavy. ",4
"Took it for 2 years and 3 months to treat Wegener's granulomatosis. Was near death before I started on it, and it perked me up and made me feel much better within just a few days. But the long-term side effects, especially on the higher doses (40-60 mg/day), were just TERRIBLE and drove me into deep depression. My appetite became enormous, my face got really bloated and I gained 30 pounds in a few months and got lots of stretch marks, I got crazy up and down (mostly down) mood swings for months and months, and I looked and felt like a hideous freak of nature. Obviously my self esteem was greatly damaged. Couldn't even look in a mirror or go out much; no chance of getting a date. Without taking the prednisone, I would have died from my disease. But the only other choice available for me - this so-called ""miracle"" drug - was living as a fat, ugly, depressed person for a few of the most important years (23-25) of my life.",5

"Just before the Holidays I developed Hydralazine induced Lupus-like desease. Terrible swelling and pain in almost all my joints. I could not walk or use my hands! 40 mg a day changed everything. I was able to lead my family through the holidays pain free. My doctor is now reducing the meds by 5mg every week. I'm down to 20 mg and just beginning to feel some joint pain again. But, the Hydralazine that caused the prob should be leaving my system. For me, with this short-term use,  this was a wonderful drug! (Although, I did gain 10 lbs in the first 2 weeks.) ",5
This medication almost killed me now I have a rapid heart beat and I am under the care of a Cardiologist because of it.,1
Seems to be solving the problem of GCAbut the side effects are way too many,4
I gain 40 to 50 pounds of fluid when I have to take 40mg of Prednisone.  My belly hangs over my crotch and is painful to carry around.  Moles appear all over my body.  My vision is worse.  Osteoporosis worse.  It's a terrible drug for me.  I try to stop the bleeding on Asacol but if it gets worse I have to take both.  I'm home bound when I have a flare up and have to schedule around going to the bathroom.,2
I have only been on this med for 6 weeks and it has made a huge difference. After about 2 days of taking I felt no more pain in my hands. Doctor is already taking me off slowly and I can already notice some pain and stiffness coming back. Would like to stay on but I will follow doctors orders.,5
"I have been prescribed prednisone for long term treatment as part of a treatment regimen for RA. Extended period at 1mg day as part of treatment, along with Methotrexate and other meds. Methotrexate aggravated severe lung infection, discontinued years ago. Prednisone is helpful. Side effect currently at 5mg day are weight gain of 18 lbs in 4 months, more antagonistic moods, slight depression, slight ankle swelling, slight rosacea on cheeks. I also take cortisone shots for elbows, knees, shoulders and hips. Cortisone seems most helpful currently, and I guess it helps to take the prednisone as well. Some occasional stomach aches, lightheadedness, have had vertigo in last six months, and other neurological events like stacked double vision, attributed to inner ear stiffening/infection, maybe related to prednisone.",4

"I am elderly. I was prescribed 20mg prednisone to take 3 times per day for 6 days, then 2 times per day for 6 days then 1 per day for 6 days. I did not get past the 1st two days when i felt worse and cut to 2 per day for two days. At the end of that day, I had a fast heartrate,was very agitated, had abdominal pains and was exhausted. I experienced fast lower back muscle spasms that evening. I stopped taking the pills and called the doctor the next day. I was also on a 100mg, 2 per day antibiotic-doxycycline for a sinus infection. This is the day after and the doctors office has not called me back! I am still very tired.",3

"Prednisone has gotten me out of some very serious flares, but of course it is not the perfect drug. When taking doses that are 20 mg or higher I experience a major increase in my appetite, a moon face, weight gain, sleeplessness, and once I even had a psychotic episode that may have been caused by the prednisone. It sometimes is absolutely necessary, but the main goal is too take the smallest dose possible or to be completely off of it which I haven't been able to do since the age of 16. I am now 24 and am managing to take 7.5 mg daily, hopefully I will completely wean off.",5
"I started taking Prednisone for weight gain and RA.  I was overweight and because of a problem with my hemoglobin, I lost a lot of weight.  Well, with the drugh< I gained it back plus some.

Will this drug make the condition worser? 2) The 5mg prednisolone that I saw on yr website is white, the doctor prescribed my mum with the 5mg red table,  what is the difference between the white and the red tablet?  Rgds Louisa",4
BEWARE!!! Had psychotic reaction to it and it was given to me in such high doses over a period of time that I eventually contracted Avascular Necrosis of both my hips and @ 42 years old had to have bilateral total hip replacements. Doctor who put me on prednisone never told me what the future side effects of this treatment may be - avascular necrosis is one of them.  Since treatment with the steroid my health has gone downhill rapidly.,1
"Although this drug eased my joint pain considerably, it did not help my lung damage which I was also taking it for.  I was taking 60 mg. a day and I could not take the side effects.  I was very agitated, tired, depressed, and I could not sleep at night.  I also gained a lot of weight as I was ravenous on this drug.  I would not take it again.",4
"I was started on the IV form in the hospital and then 80mg a day pill form. I have been slowly decreasing the dosage over the last 6 weeks and am at 15mg a day currently. Side effects for me are increased hunger which isn't a problem for me since I am thin, muscle cramps (hands, feet, calves), constant urination at higher dosages, increased irritability. I was also prescribed Pantoprazole to prevent stomach ulcers since Prednisone may cause those. My platelet counts are back to normal but I can't say if the Prednisone had anything to do with it.",3

I have back and knee problems and was on vicodin and prednisone.the Prednisone twice at monthly intervals. I went to another doctor and found out I have Hep C. Could the prednisone have caused an infection like this?,2
I have ulcerative colitis & Lupus. I refused to take this drug for a long time until my doctor insisted I try it for at least 1 month. I have always had a bad temper and within 3 days of taking this I felt like I was going to explode with anger. I also can't sleep and my shoes don't fit due to the swelling. I'm not going to continue this med. After reading these reviews I think it's best to get off it now. I'll keep searching for relief from the pain and bloody stools through alternative methods. ,2
I take it for sarcoidosis and adrenal insufficiency.  The original use was for sarcoidosis but the presdnisone caused my adrenal glands to atrophy.  Now I take it for both conditions.  It helps me live a functioning daily life.  I can work but it does effect my immune system and I bruise easily.  It helps replace my cortisol loss.,5
"While taking Prednisone for my Chronic Hives, I found that not only did it remove the symptoms but I felt stronger in general. I was less tired, able to participate in activities without becoming tired or out of breath, I slept better, and felt better all together.  However, many of the side effects of prednisone occered after I weened off of it.",5
"Aside from some weight gain, the only side effects I've ever had were from running out. I try not to but even with insurance I can't afford to see the doctor as much as he would like and so he'll only prescribe 3 months at a time. After hospitalization, I suffer from more side-effects because the dosage is so much higher than what I take orally at home. This drug in combination with Theodur and singular keep my asthma in check. Of course, stress is a BIG trigger for me and then I usually bump up the dosage,not unlike a dose pack(5,4,3,2,1...)and it usually does the trick.",5
"I am 28 years old and have had Asthma since i was 4, I hate when I have an attack because i know i will have to take pred., to start the taste is horrible and hard to avoid, it also makes me cramp in weird places(top of my foot, toes) It helps me breath though so I guess its worth it, because not breathing is much worse than any of these issues it causes",5
"I read all the comments and found myself with many of the symptoms posted..mainly mood swings, night sweats, withdrawal pain, trouble sleeping. I guess the difference is I have tried almost every treatment available for Crohns besides surgery. Remicade IV therapy worked the best but at 9K every six weeks who can afford that even with insurance. Humira was ok but I gave it 4-5 months and expected more I guess. I'm concerned about the side effects of Prednisone but its the only thing that slows down Crohns. I'm experimenting with pro biotics now and it has shown promising signs of regulation and assisting with digestion. I feel that our bodies don't digest and break down foods properly because of our ""super"" immune systems killing all good and bad bacteria in our bodies. With the addition of probiotics there is a difference but I haven't been on it long enough to say how good it can be. I'm willing to try anything drug out there that works. This disease is probably one of the worst under rated conditions out there today.

"I have been taking Prednisone for a year to treat anemia.  The highest dose I've been on until recently is 60mg--and they gradually wean you off it. 60mg is debilitating.  I was prescribed 100 mg to bump my blood up and ended up in excrutiating pelvic pain/agony in the Emergency Room after 4 days.  I've was lowered to 60mg and could barely walk due to muscle weakness.  I tore a muscle in my butt trying to get out of bed to go to the washroom--it tore like wet tissue paper.  I have moon face, my muscles have degenerated so rapidly my skin is loose, yet I've gained weight (water) in my torso.  I experienced extreme mood swings, lack of sleep, food cravings and a few times, severe knee and ankle pain.  I'm on track to have my spleen removed as a cure for the anemia and I can't get off this drug fast enough.  My vision is starting to blur.  This is one drug that doesn't make any sense to me.  I may end up osteoarthritis, yet it supposed to cure joint inflammation.  I pulled a muscle in my leg the other just trying to stand up.  After I take a dose, I sleep for a couple of hours.  I get about 2-4 hours of sleep each time.  I repeat--I was only taking about 30mg for a year, and then was gradually weaned off completely--my blood count dropped rapidy and my stupid idiot doctor prescribed 100mg and I almost died from shock and trauma from the pelvic pain.  It was the most agony I've been in my entire life and I hardly believe I'm still around.",5

Dosage was lowered and a core decompression of both hips was performed. Arthritis had already set in on my right hip and I still have minor pain to this day.

For the week and a half treatment, I had increased hunger, irritability and mood swings, puffing of cheeks, 5 pound weight gain, heartburn, dizziness(room spinning)and a wierd tingling numb sensation across my entire body.  The doseage for the week and a half was much higher, some days at 60 mg, and the tapering off wasn't as smooth as the month treatment, where I worked up to 40mg a day tops,  so I think that's why coming off of the drug has been hard, and very bad mood swings and side effects the latter treatment.  However, the drug did do it's job, just not fun to deal with the side effects.",5
bad side effect is that my skin has become so thin that it tears off very easlily.,5
"It gives me back energy, as I am often fatigued with this disease, and it also helps tremendously with the pain and swelling, it is truly a miracle drug for people that suffer like me. Sure causes you to puff up, however, which is not good. I get hungry on this drug. Munch all day.",5
"Whenever I develop bronchitis, my asthma acts up.  My doctor always prescribes Prednisone for me.  Within a few hours of taking it, I can breathe better and my cough is more productive.  The problem is the side effects I have.  Constant urination that is hard to control, no sleep, hunger pains if I don't eat every 3 hours, food cravings, and if I take Albuterol while I'm on Prednisone, I get thrush in my mouth and throat.  I also put on a few pounds, which is okay for me because I'm thin anyway.",5
"i've always been allergic to dogs, but one day after being around a dog i had a horrible asthma attack that landed me in the ER and after doing a few breathing treatments my breathing was just a little bit better so they put me on prednisone. i've experienced some problems concentrating, minor head aches, dizziness, and little bit of extra energy.. but my breathing has improved :)",4
"Took high dosage due to low platelet count.  Found that after weeks of decreasing the drug after using for several months, my platelet count has gone back up.  Feel as though the high dosage (60mg) was not helping but may have had adverse impact to my disease state ITP.",1
It causes inreased thirst and urination and difficulty controlling bladder,4
"I've had RA for 25 out of my 30 years and it works great. It's the only thing that makes me feel like I'm living again, but after 25 years of being on and off I am really feeling the side effects. Not to mention my weight will go up and down. My mom looks at pic's and can tell you how I was doing at that time because of my weight. Great side effect! Works well, but not the long term drug we all would like it to be!",5
"I have been on prednisone for 18 months and it has caused numerous secondary diseases and side-effects; diabetes, thrush, weight gain. It has done nothing to change my condition, sarcoidosis in my right lung. I was taken off of it too fast - from 10mg to 5 mg to zero and I ended up in the hospital in severe pain, hallucinating, freezing cold. I am back on it, which relieved the symptoms of withdrawal. I wish I had never started taking this drug. It did not improve my initial condition, it has permanently damaged me, and it is difficult to withdraw from. Had I known more about it and its limited potential to be of value for sarcoid, I would have requested a second opinion. before beginning use. ",1
easy to use however I seem to have put on weight being on this medication,5
It worked the pain and swellowing went down but came back when i went off the medication,5
This medication worked as far as my symptoms but had major adverse effects on my personality.  I had a total personality change and it was not a pleasant experience for me or those around me.,2
"I have had hives all over my body for 2 yrs. Pred. helped but the next day I wouldstart all over.(Before I make a comment I just want to say I am on no other meds to cause any side effects.) The side effects are not so good weight gain, pain in side and up throat, bone loss,leg cramps,eye pain.I does work so you can at least go in public.I stopped taking it 3wks. ago. I guess I will just suffer until they can find out what is wrong with me.",5
"I just recently had a really bad asthma flare up. I've never experienced my asthma this bad before and ended up in the ER last Monday because of it. I was already on a small burst of pred for 5 days, but it wasn't working. So, the ER gave me an IV with a steroid/breathing treatments. Then I was prescribed this in a taper. 60 x2, 40 x2, 20 x2, 10 x2 and then 5 x2, I'm on the last 2 days and I'm finally starting to feel better. However, the side-effects are frustrating. I'm already overweight (working on it, lost 20 lbs this year so far), BUT I def feel some water retention weight gain, my lymph nodes are sooo swollen (looked it up, def. a side effect), mood swings beyond all mood swings, tired, weakness, stiffness in my back, can't concentrate (started a new job and this is the most frusrtating for me), shaky, lightheadedness, dizziness/loss of balance. Overall though, I'm pleased, because I can breathe easier, but I don't think I could always take it.",4
I have been put on low dose prednisone for the past couple of years due to severe pericarditis (which was just recently diagnosed after 6 years). This is by far the worst drug I have ever been on. I think I've had every side effect known - gained 75 pounds. With any luck I'll be able to complete my taper off of it in the next 6 months.,3
Have severe asthma and I could not function without this drug (along with 4 others).  I experience no side effects from it but my asthma symptoms improve dramatically.  I take it 20mg every other day and do a burst when needed.  ,5
"I was prescribed a high dose of prednisone to get a lupus flare under control. It didn't do much of anything for me and the side effects were unbarable. It made me jittery, a little crazy, and brought my blood sugar way up. I was taken off of it less then a week after it was prescribed because my side effects were so severe. I think it would be wise to explore other options before this drug. ",1

Take 500 mg  twice a day occasionally when I have a flare up of arthritis in my foot/toes.  Flare up may be gout for which I take allopurinol to control uric acid.  It works quickly without side effects but I also quit it as soon as things are better.  May try a lower dose of Aleve to maintain good effect.,3
"I was prescribed a 6-day regimen for an inflamed/swollen knuckle and within 24 hrs had developed a sudden on-set HBP.

Then, hospitalized and I.V. drip. Coming home this past week, I have been tapering off from the 40 mgs. and am down to 1 mg. daily.

It takes alot for me to walk across the room. I have never had this before with pred. Weak as ever but my breathing is pretty good. Blood sugar elevated, needed insulin in ther hospital, high blood pressure, (needed pills) now that I am tapering, everything is normal again exept for the weakness in legs.

I took a dose myself, being a caring mother and all, and was outraged at how strong this medicine is. I would recommended this medicine as a LAST resort, especially for children.

"I have been taking Prednisone for six years to treat my hemolytic anemia. This medication has been a nightmare and a blessing. A blessing because it has helped my hemoglobin levels rise but lately it hasn't even done that. For six years i've been living with most of the side effects listed for this medication.

I've gained a terrible amount of weight, my face shape has acquired an unusual form, i have rashes all over, i get rapid mood changes that are dreadful most of the time,my whole body aches...I can go on for days just listing all the negative effects. After six years Prednisone stopped helping my situation and now I'm just suffering through the side effects just in case it starts working again because there is nothing else I can take.

Its like clock work i take it no matter the dosage and about and hour later i experience muscle ""cramps"" especially in the thigh area. The only thing that relieves the pain is pressure on the pain site or massageing the area constantly. Ihave even been prescribed Vicodin the pain has been so severe.

I only started the meds yesterday, but I'd like to warn fellow singers and actors that the meds are VERY intense. I was onstage during rehearsal and lost my breath and started sweating intensely. I almost fell in the orchestra pit. Needless to stay, I sat out the rest of rehearsal, but I can say that the medicine is working. I know I'll be ready to sing in a few days.

"My GI Specialist prescribed Prednisone for my ulcerative colitis. After almost a year on Lialda, I continued to have blood in my stool, which meant the Lialda wasn't being effective. The GI Spec told me I would not be taking the Prednisone long term and after about a month, he has started tapering my dosage. I will completely discontinue it in about 6 weeks. I will then be placed on a maintenance med which is expected to make me more susceptible to anemia, which I have had from time to time over the years anyway. But I'm willing to deal with that as long as I can address the anemia, should it occur, through diet.   Prednisone was almost immediately effective in reducing the 2 major problems with my colitis - reducing 3 to 4 BMs per day to 1 and no more blood in stool. Drawback of the Prednisone, increased water retention in my face and right ankle; and it elevated my blood pressure significantly: from an average of 130/70 to 150/90 to 104. Along with the GI doc tapering the Prednisone, my primary care doctor prescribed a very strong diuretic which helped in getting my BP back under control.  Bottom line, for me personally, Prednisone was okay for short-term use only. I would definitely not want to take this medication on an on-going or extended period of time. The side effects were almost worse, in my opinion, than what my doctor was trying to treat by prescribing it.",4

Apparently the drug has long term affects even when you are off it, it  has closed my blood vessels to my femur and now I need both knees and hips replaced. I am in severe pain all the time.

I have been taking Prednisone for 18 months now for Polymyalgia Rheumatica. I initially started out at 40mg and eventually was weaned off them completely. The pain and immobility from the Polymyalgia was severe but after taking the first dose of 40mg the pain disappeared over night. I was able to move my shoulders and the pain was gone. This product is short of a miracle for me. However the side effects are cruel. I gained 65 pounds and my face was so moon shaped and bloated family members who had not seen me on a daily basis did not recognize me. I think a small price to pay for relief. The only problem now is I can not have my knees replaced until I shed some of the weight I gained.,5

I have to wear an ID bracelet telling medical people that I take Prednisone. I am also having trouble keeping my weight down. I want to eat every chocolate bar I see.

constipation,1
I took this medication after being hit by a car while riding my bike.  Presumably to lower the inflammation in my neck and back.  Although my doc never explained this to me.    while taking I experienced extreme periods of rage and terrible mood swings.  I am not sure if this was due to all of the stress and added pain of being struck by a car or the medication.    My step father takes this med for a liver transplant.  And I have noticed that he is very irratable and irrational at times.  Although I did not know him before he started treating with this med,2

what is prper dosing scheduale for allergies,2
"I had a pituitary tumor removed 36 yrs ago and have been on predisone ever since. I only take 5mg but because I have been on it so long I now have osteoporosis. I take fosamax for this condition and seem to be having more aches and pains than before. I just read that fosamax can cause heart problems. I think I will see about getting off it and take my chances. I can't give blood because of the prednisone,so I can't help my family if they were to need me.",3
"Had liver transplant 5 weeks ago. Prednisone causes erratic sleep patterns. I am up a lot at night and sleep frequently during day.  I experience tremors to the extent I can hardly write or hold objects in the same hand for long. Early in treatment I experienced some paranoia and mood swings, but that has subsided. I believe I have experienced increased libido from this drug use.  Generally good response to this drug.",5
"the dosing directions were difficult to follow.But what a appetite I got after taking a dose. I was having alot of mucus in my lungs,was weezing all night,shortness of breath, this seemed to help.",3
"I have taken steroids for asthma, on and off, for over 40 years.  I have a steroidal hump (huge hump at the base of my neck/spine) and a moonface (odd shape like an oval).  These side effects will NEVER go away.  While this drug does ""work"", it also causes a huge weight gain of fluid (10-15 lbs in 1 day!!).  I also get the sensations of my skin crawling which drives me nuts.  There are soooo many side effects.  I hope no one else ever has to take this med.",4
"Although, I have had weight gain and moodiness with this medication.  It does control the pain and stiffness of RA.",4
The side effects of prednisone are far worse than the symptoms it is prescribed to releive.  ,2
"Crohns disease has put me on presidone for sometime of 8 weeks. I started taking 8 a day in the morning with 4 500mg of pentasa. It does help speed the process.The downside of this medication is the agitation it brings.Little things seem a little bigger and things I would'nt normally get frustrated with I did.I did'nt notice any weight gain although thats what was said to happen when taking presidone. Also by the time you get to 4 or 5 tablets daily and you still feel pain, it;s better to go back to the Dr. and let them know by that time the inflamation should be down and the effectivness of the medicine should've already worked by this point. They will probally switch your primary medication.",3
wonderful for my dogs skin allergies,5
I had to take this medication for swelling in my jaw and 2 days after finishing the dosing I wound up in the Hospital with a case of Diverticulitis!  Could this have been caused by the Prednisone?  Anyone have this problem?,2
"I don't like Prednisone. It seems to be making me gain weight, and I don't like that.",3
had an allergic reaction to an antibotic. the first day i took the medicine i slept all day and was very groggy.  im down to 20 mg a day for 2 more days and i never want to take the stuff again.  my neck and ears are stiff and i feel stuffy and full in my head.  the doc said the prednisone would clear up my sinuses but no such luck.  i've been on it for a week and feel worse than when i just had a rash.,3

I have been on this medication for four days i can tell a big difference in my feelings.,5
"I was recently diagnosed with mononucleosis. My major symptom was a severe swollen throat, that included unbelievable pain and swelling so bad that I eventually could not eat.   Other prescription drugs barely made the pain any more tolerable. But within 30 minutes of my first dose of prednisone, my throat was palpably less swollen, my neck mobility was greatly improved, and... most importantly... the pain has diminished from an unbearable, constant pain to nothing worse than the kind of mild sore throat you get with the average cold. The effects have lasted all day.  I am so happy right now. This prescription allowed me to eat for the first time in three days, and I'm looking forward to sleeping without waking up screaming for the first time in days too.",5
I was treated intravenously and still on 30 mg a day.  I had an allergic reaction to pestisides which burnt my body.  I have no taste.  I have a weird smell to myself and joint pain. I am always thirsty.,3

Am on my second day and have horrible side effects that start almost immediately upon taking.  If you have problems with depression, stay away from this drug.  It makes it worse.  The mood swings are terrible.  It does work on drying up the lesions.  You have to weigh the side effects with way the medicine does do its job on Hailey-Hailey.  Will be glad to be off the medicine.",5
the drug you love but hate.. i been on 40mg all the way up to 150mg a day for almost six yrs now. the drug keeps me alive but its killing me at the same time.. would tell everybody to stay away from it..,5

For 4 months for RA I have been taking prednisone 5 mg a day in addition to methotrexate - and I feel back to normal - do have some stomach problems.  Very happy with prednisone - the methotrexate alone was not doing the trick.,5
"Back pain w.arthritis, stenosis, and scartissue after 2 back surgeries. ",4
I have had asthma for 45 years and I have taken Prednisone off and on. It has kept me out of the hospital many times.  I hate the side effects.  It can turn a nice average weight person into a person with a weight problem because you can't stop eating. I know it affects your brain because I see things that aren't there and the nightmares get a bit too much.  Sometimes I take it with dexedrine to stop the eating. I get very nasty....but it does work so what can you do!  ,4
"My doctor prescribed 60 mg a day for my IBD.  Unfortunately, it did not work at all so I have been taking it in vain.  I am now down to 25mg a day and will continue to wean off of it.  I have trouble sleeping--a bit of the moon face syndrome & feel fatigued (although this could be from the anemia & anxiety).  Has anyone heard of canker sores & heartburn form steroids? I know they are a miracle drug--they just didn't work for me.  Oh well, now I know.  I have started remicade infusions & they are working great.  Good luck to all of you!  Wouldn't it be nicer to do a consumer report on a vacuum rather than a medication?  Something tells us folks (like me) who are writing these reviews might do better staying away from web md.  Hmmmmm.   I'll try!  Peace.",1
"I was diagnosed 8 months ago with PMR/GCA.  I have been on prednisone since.  I hate the side effects!!!! I feel sick, very tired,(tired doesn't even start to explain it!) and the lovely weight gain whoo hoo!  On the brighter side I can see and am no longer losing my vision, so I guess it's a miricle drug, just wish they would find one without soooo many side effects!!",3
"Took for sinus infection and bronchitis.  Started having nervousness, anxiety attacks, heart palputations.",3
"Prednisone worked well on my Arthritis. I had it for 4 weeks and started from 80mg tapered to 5 mg.  I felt better from day 5, I stopped now and my condition's fairly well, but not as good as I had the medicine. Adverse effects were weight gain, difficult to sleep, and leg cramps. Adverse effects were alleviated after 2 weeks I stopped it.  Overall, it's better not having this medicine for long time, if you have other choice.",4
I love this medication. It took away my problem within one week. Thanks to the creator of this product.,5
Im taking 7 5mg tabs first day then tapering by one each day for one week.  i have taken it in the past and works like a charm for chronic sinus infection and nasal inflammation including polyps. I'm on day two and have no side effects besides slight indigestion but goes away quickly especially with food.,5
I AM CURRENTLY USING THIS MED. FOR CUSHING SYNDROME. STARTED ON 20MG IN THE MORNING 10MG IN THE EVENING. EVERY TIME THEY LOWERD THE DOSE MY ENTIRE BODY WOULD ACHE FOR DAYS. I FEEL SICK EVERY DAY!

"I havae been taking Prednisone for 6 weeks. I started with Prednisone 30 mg q d for Chronic Bronchitis. That didn't work and I was about to go to Colorado for my daughter's wedding. (elevation 8100 ft) My doctor increased the dose to Prednisone 80 qd until I started feeling better. I look like a chipmunk.  I have been decreasing the dosage, but just when I got to 30 mg a day- I started coughing again.  The side effects are really bad.  Shaking hands, pounding heart and really weird thoughts.  I am an RN, but I just didn't think the medication would bother me.  Wrong.  I am days from completely being off the medication, yea!  I don't want to take it ever again-- although I know it is a wonder drug for most everyone who takes it. ",3
"I have had COPD for 3 years now.  Had what I call a ""bad"" day, one where I could barely get to the bathroom without getting out of breath, when I decided to check with Dr. he called in a prescription for Prednisone.  What a miracle.  It has been too long since I felt like this. I'll take the light stomach upset for the JOY of taking a full shampoo & shower standing up & by myself.  I feel the relief right after the first dose.",5
13 years back I had consecutive heart failures followed by Dressler Syndrome (Pericardial Efuision) Since then I am having this medicine.the dose thereof was gradually reduced but upto some period could not be totally stopped on the apprehension of recurrance of above symptoms.

I ended up in the hospital w/congestive heart failure due to my lupus. There they began me on 20 mg 3 times a day and boy was i HIGH. I felt wired 24/7. I could not compose myself enough to sit down. I had to be constantly doing something which was actually a bit nice because for the last 3 years i hadn't had enough energy to do much of anything. I MUST say though i feel 100% better. i'm now on 10mg 2 times a day. this lower dosage is a LOT eaiser to handle. My life has taken a complete 360 thanks be to GOD and his allowance of the creation of this drug. ,5
this drug along with Avelox is not helping my Sx after 72 hours of use. I remain sob and unable to properly move air into my lungs.,3
"I've been on Prednisone for years because of my systemic lupus. It's the only medication that has kept my flare ups to a minimum--unfortunately at a price. I've had weight gain--now controlled, degenerative disc disease brought on by the prenisone; high blood pressure; premature cataracts; quite a lengthy list. Is the price worth it? I think so because the alternative would be that I wouldn't be here among the living.",5

"This drug has worked extremely well for me.  I was on it for 4 months, starting at 30mg and tapered off.  Felt great, like myself again while on the drug and had no side effects.  However, I have been off of it one month and have not felt good at all.  Tired all the time, so little energy and achy all over.  As great as I felt while I was on it, I would avoid doing it again because of the after effects.",5
Dr. prescribed 13 50mg tabs at 9 am and 12 tabs at 9 pm for 3 days when should i start feeling less fatigued,2
"I was given Predisone by IV for three days in the hospital and then tapering off for a week. But the bad effects didnt occur until months later when muscle spasms started, knots in my legs which were painful, anxiety, fears, glands hurt, liver painful, stomach pain,my neck painful and cracking when I turn my head.They are lessoning now  But have been told it takes a year and a half to get it out of my systom.

"I was given this medication for what was thought to be a severe ear infection. I didn't realize this until later, but was given 2 separate shots of steroids at the doctor's office a week apart, then also separately given Prednisone to take orally for several days. It gave me horrible mood swings--I am so thankful my family was around to help me and notice the changes in my behavior. I became angry in an instant over minor things, became extremely fearful for my future and at one time felt like I wanted to jump outside my own skin. I was also taking antibiotics. I am so thankful that my nurse practitioner sister told me to no longer take the Prednisone--I truly was beside myself and was crying incessantly in public over my future. I still don't know what the situation is (I have vertigo at times), but am very thankful that I now know to look at the drugs I am taking more carefully and reviewing how the prescribed drugs themselves are making me feel. I know others have said that Prednisone is a Godsend for them with their medical issues. ",1
"Works remarkably well, but sure puffs up your weight, doctor says keep dosage low, good advice.",5
"Have used many times over last 10 years for asthma, copd.  Works well for breathing, side effects are weight gain, mood swings, no sleep, distended abdomen. Dr dislikes, urges try to not use unless absolutely necessary.  I agree",5
"While the drug does what it's supposed to do, it also does a lot that I wish it didn't.",4
"Side effects are awful, but better than having kidney failure. Weight gain and mood swings have been the worst. Started out at 80 mg. day for 6 weeks then tried to taper dose, but had a relapse....now taking 70 mg. every other day and starting to taper again.",4
"I was prescribed Prednisone 20mg for inflammition of the nose/respiratory area and increased asthma symptoms. Prednisone works but, I had two side effects: 1) Extremely difficult to sleep 2) HICCUPS  (they just would not go away). ",4
I can breath with this med. But the side effects are killing me. And don't know if I will ever be able to get off of it. My whole body is swelling up. My eye sight is worse. I feel like I'm choking all the time. The wt. gain is terrible. Nothing tastes good. I feel like dieing would be a better option than being dependant on this drug. More bad days than good days & thats not due to breathing. I'm on 5 mgs right now but everytime I try to cut down my breathing gets worse. The fear of not breathing makes my dosage go up. Darned if I do & darned if I don't.,5
Being on this treatment has helped me in my daily routine and activities that I could not do without this treatment.,5
"I take prednisone (7.5mg)daily.  But I only take the extra half if I get sleepy in the middle of the day.(I have 2 children that are under the autism spectrum disorder)umbrella.   I have been on this drug for 9 years.  In 1999 I was diagnosed with Sheehans Syndrome 2nd to panhypopituitarism(distroyed pit gland)so I am adrenal deficient.  When I get stressed, I have to take dexomethesone sodium phosphate(only in a emergency and I take double or trible my dose of prednisone depending on how sick I get.   There has been no weight gain, actually I am at 139lbs which is where I was before I got pregnant with my 13 year old.   ",5
"I was on Prednisone for 4 months and it helped my breathing problems and cleared up other physical pains, but the side effects were too much to put up with.  I had very bad mood swings, extensive swelling, increased appetite, weight gain, bruising, bad leg and stomach cramps, unable to sleep, and excessive urination.  My face looked like a balloon and I wanted to take a pin and let the air out.   I was on it as an experiment, after being told that it only had a 1% chance of helping me.  At this point I figured I had nothing to lose.  Well, I made the wrong decision.  Even though I wouldn't advise others to take it, I watched it help my 3 year old grandson who's battling leukemia.  Just remember that he suffered some of the same side effects.  So I guess the question to ask yourself is if the good out-weighs the bad??",4
"I have been on high doses of Prednisone for a year an a half for acute kidney failure. The kidney failure does not bother me as much as the Prednisone side affects. Always feeling tired, don't sleep at night, weight gain, puffy face, large hump on back of neck, abdominal swelling, red face, blood clots, feet and ankle sweeling, dazed feeling, blured vision, hiccups, joint weakness, the list goes on forever!

It has caused problems with the immune system igd and ige tests will be coming soon I'm sure. It was also acompied by chest pains bad enough to go to the hospital. It has now gone from poision Ivy to a medical puzzle. where Is dr House when you need Him?,3
Since March I've been on three drugs that didn't help and may have made my Crohn's worse. By the start of June (2008) while in my doctor's office I was told that I may need to go under the knife if the problem gets worse.  So I started on Prednisone and it's now a week later I'm NORMAL AGAIN!!! I went from running to the bathroom 20+ times a day now I'm down to three times and no diaherra.   This drug may not work for everyone and that was told to me by my GI doctor. I also did a small bowel test to make sure I was healthy to take this drug.,5
"I absolutely love this ""miracle"" drug.  It has helped me with my initial problem and so many more that I didn't even consider seeking treatment for.  I would love to find a way to stay on it indefinately.  DR. says ""no"" though.",5
I took this medication to counteract inflammation in my nasal and sinus cavities. Taking the medication was fine.. very bitter taste but with juice made it better. I found that I urinated much more and more frequently. My major concern was the extreme increase in appetite and weight gain.,5
"I was given prednisone to help ease an allergic reaction to another drug that I was perscribed.  I NEVER want to take prenisone again.  It gave me severe mood swings.  I yelled at my spouse frequently for stupid things: driving past parking spots, not putting socks in the laundry basket, etc.  After I was done with my prednisone, I got severe chest pains and stomache aches.  I had to go back to the hospital to correct the problems that prednisone had caused me.  After talking with other people I work with who have used this drug I have learned that others have had similiar experieces with it and they do not like it as well.",3
I TAKE THIS FOR ADRENAL DEFICIANCY AND SEVERE BACK AND SHOULDER PAIN AND INFLAMATION IT IS AN EXCELLENT MEDICATION WHEN USED AS PRESCRIBED,5
just started takin,1
"Was given this drug (one week) for fire ant sting for hives, itching, mild headache and muscle and joint aches...ie. serum sickness.  THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE WORSE THAN THE ILLNESS.   Hives and itching are gone but headache more severe, dizziness, weakness to the point of inability to function, decreased white blood cell count, flare up of existing interstitial cyctitis, aching and muscle spasms all over body, burning skin.  Will have to be desperate to ever take this drug again.",2
"i took this med for a nasal polyp. while i was on it the medicine did it's job and worked very well. i have taken prenisone several times in the past and have never had the side effects that i've had this time. i experienced severe headaches,swelling in my body, skin tender to the touch and just all around exhausted. This was all after i was off it, within a day. I hope that i don't have to take it again.",5
"The predisone has kept my RA under control, but the other damage it has done is hard to imagine. Sweats, swelling, thining skin so much my veins are showing, easly bruised that doesn't go away, easily cut, weight gain, sleepless nights, mood swings.leg cramps, fingers tingly, itching, muscle weekness. I have been on predisone, 10 mg, for 12 years.Jist dropped down to 8mg.  ",5
It was prescribed for a facial rash that we believe is a Lupus butterfly rash.,5
"I take prednisone for asthma. I am glad that I am able to breathe when I take it, but the side effets are bad. The asthma makes me weak, but the prednisone tricks me into thinking I can ""climb mouintians."" I'll get up and take a shower and get dressed to go out and then have to lie down for the rest of the day, because I am so tired.  I usually gain 10 pounds per round of treatment and it takes me forever (6 months or more)to take it off. The strangest side effect is that I talk a mile a minute while I am on it. And of course I can't sleep, even though I take it early in the morning. It also tears up my stomach. The reflux that I normally have is multiplied many times by prednisone. But I can breath!!! ",5
"I have had a rash for 3mo, no one knows what it is.I was put on this medicine and within 24hrs the itching subsided and after a week it is almost gone.  After numberous Dr's finally someone found a cure for all my itching.",5
"I AM TAKING THIS MED FOR RA. I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 3 YEARS.  THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS I GAINED 30 POUND IN THE FIRST YEAR OF TAKING IT. I AM NOW TRYING TO GET OFF OF IT DUE TO POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS (DM, HAIR GROWTH,  BONE WASTEING ETC.).     ",5
"I have been prescribed this medication in the past for severe asthma attacks and the medication itself is extremely helpful in helping me breate better. HOWEVER- I do have crazy side effects such as body shakes, spongey legs, constant sick to my stomach feeling, and just spacey in general. I have never been prescribed this medication for longer than a week and I DREAD coming off it. I get SEVERE body pains to the point where I hurt to be touched.",4
"I have asthma, but was prescribed prednisone for an allergic reaction.  I have refused the drug for the last 10 years, but gave in this time, and I regret it.  After 4 days of stomach distention, constipation, excessive gas, bloating, swollen legs and arms, a puffy face and insomnia, I quit cold turkey.  A decision I also regret as I am now plagued with whole body pain, weakness, muscle cramps, headaches, dizziness, lethargy, exhaustion and bruising.  This is the worst drug I have taken and I will never take it again.  That said, my mother took a low dose of the drug for 2 or 3 years for arthritis and had no side effects, except the very beginning of a cataract, which is when she quit taking it.  If the condition is severe, the drug is probably effective, but for me, it's not worth the trade off. I'd rather use my inhaler a little more often, or suffer with allergies and a sore throat for a few more days than to ever take this drug again.",1
No improvement in condition,3
"I have taken this drug for about 15 years for RA and Fibromyalgia.  It has been a lifesaver.  I have been prescribed many arthritis drugs...some have worked some not.  Took Plaquenil for several years and had to stop because it began to affect my eyes.  Have been on only Presnisone for several years...mostly at 2.5 mg per day.  I am now taking 10 mg per day in the morning.  My bone density is very good...took Fosamax for several years as well as calcium.  I have not had any serious side effects from this drug...it has been a lifesaver for me...no weight gain, a little trouble sleeping...but at 71 years of age, probably to be expected.  Don't know if you have been told this...I was told by my dr. that if you take your Prednisone is two doses, it doubles the dose..that is, if you take 5 mg in the am and 5 mg in the pm, it is equal to 20 mg per day.  I have had some problems with cramps in my feet...I find that walking every day helps this a lot...my dr. also prescribed Robaxin...a mild muscle relaxant which works very well.",5
"i don't like taking added steriods and i have vision change and back pain, i am tired and concerned about the use.",5
I've had RA for 34 years and have taken prednisone for 24 years.  I'm the 3rd generation and 4th person in my family to have RA. This drug has given me a quality of live I never could have imagined.  I take 7 mg. daily. ,5
"Prednospne causes a lot of side effects for me.  Getting off of it after the high doses I was put on is like what I imagine it would be like coming off of a drug addiction.  I have weight gain, swelling of my face, lymph nodes, and abdomen.  I have sweats, spongy legs, I feel like my skin is sliding off, I have blurred vision and it affects my sense of taste - and not in a good way.  It makes me feel so weak I have to lie down several times a day.  It has taken me several months to a year to detox from the drug.",5
"It has bee very had on my skin ,hard for ulcer to heal.",4
"Prescribed two-week course for Poison Ivy.  (60mg/day for one week, 30mg/day for another week.)  Took care of deep itching and stopped the blisters from weeping.  Any remaining itching is more due to the healing blisters than any allergic reaction.  Side effects not bad: Made me hungry as heck, and had difficulty concentrating and sleeping.  Not something I would want to take for a long time, or often, but it was a heck of a lot better than wanting to dig a trench in my arms with my fingernails.  Before I took the Prednisone, the only thing that would help was Benadryl, which knocked me flat.  I took the Prednisone a week into the rash, and it worked like a charm.",4
my daughter was on this for a bit due to her asthma and made her crazy and cry for hours i hated her being on the medication that made her so upset and you couldn't even touch her it made her miserable and i couldn't even help her i will not put her on this again there must be something else she can takd,3
"No sleep, speeding one minute exhausted the next, very emotional, upset easily, depressed and just wacky from lack of sleep. DO NOT LET ANYONE PUT YOU ON THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT A SLEEPING AID! When a Dr has put me on this drug (apprx 10 times) the cure is always worst than the illness. Meaning I am laid off work from 1 month to two months just because of the way I feel from the predisone, even after my illness shortness of breath is long gone...Predisone is a net, a last and appropriate resort by a Dr but there is diffinately a downside.  ",5
"I have allergies, and sometimes it gets so bad i can't breathe. If it wasn't for the prednisone, i don't know what i would do, thanks to my dr. and this treatment, it works really well, doesn't take long to make it go away.",5
always forgets what day I am on.,5
It keeps the sarcoidosis away. once I stop taking the pills it comes back. I do not like the fact that I get cotton mouth form it or that I gain weight too.,5
"I have to take prednisone for a week about 2-3 times a year (I am really allergic to poison oak but I play soccer and hike so I get it all the time). Too high of a dose gives me a ""rebound"" rash - deep red, itchy, and dry - but a lower dose that tapers off during the week works fantastic. The only side effect I have is insomnia, while I am using prednisone I usually sleep on 4-5 hrs a night :/ Other than that, for short term use for contact dermatitis prednisone is a great drug!",4
"the side effects suck, swelling of my ankles and now having to wear compression stockings. bruise easily. high blood pressure.  weight gain. but its the only med keeping from having a crohns flair and a trip to the hospital for five days at a time. ",5
"This medication made my bloodpressure skyrocket, made me gain 50lbs in 30 days and almost caused conjestive heart failure.I blame the majority of this on the treating doctor, as I told him the problems I was having and he said the medicatin wouldnt cause it.",5
"This is my second time in one year of taking this. I am taking it for my SI joint is out of place again. It causes me to have trouble sleeping, sweats, mood swings, becoming irritable, feeling like everything is going wrong in life... but it's not. I don't know what else I can do to help with this pain when my SI joint goes out. Thank God I only have to take it for one week.",5
"I have been taking this medicine for over 17 years every day and will for the rest of my life due to Cushings disease and the removal of both adrenal glands. The dosage depends on if I am sick or not but normally it is 20 mg daily. I wish there were a better alternative but there isn't. I don't know which side affect is worse, leg pain/cramps, sweating, bone/muscle pain, bone thinning, headaches, having to be in ICU because of a common cold. Oh yeah, lets not forget the constant threat of dehydration. I guess when you look at it though it beats the alternative. ",3
"I noticed an increase in muscle cramps in the lower legs and fingers and rib muscles. The cramps are very severe and long lasting. But, the breathing has been much improved.  I don't know if this drug is responsible or if the  nebulizers are actually responsible.",4

"I was given 5 mg of this medication to take - I had to take 6 pills this morning, then five pills tomorrow, and then 4 the next day and so on.. until the medication is gone.  I was prescribed it for bad sinuses.  So far my sinuses are draining down my throat and I can breathe! I have a little headache, but I can deal with it!",5
"I am only on day 2 of day 5 on taking Prednisone Pills (20mg) once in the morning and once in the evening with food as perscribed for my asthma. Since starting yesterday I have noticed my breathing has become easier. I had an attack ealier today and used my abutertol inhaler and am now feeling alot better. Overall I do believe that this is a great pill.I have to see my doctor in a week to see how the pill worked , and hopefully I can continue to take it because it helps.The only side effect I have right now is a bit of trouble falling asleep.Normally I go to bed around 10 pm and since taking the Prednisone I havnt been falling asleep until about 1am and have been tossing and turning all night. I also normally don't wake up on my own but this morning awoke a 6am and couldn't fall back asleep.",5
"While the drug (in combination with others) have brought me off dialysis twice - and worked to keep me off dialysis three or four other times, it has virtually destroyed my body.  As a trade-off with dialysis and intermittent nephrotic syndrome it has been a success.  But all the other problems it has caused is not a reasonable trade-off.  Anybody out there with similar feelings?",4
"given 60mg in ER after an asthma attack, prescribed to take 40mg daily for the next five days (today is day two of those five). had a REALLY horrible headache yesterday, didn't go away until I went to sleep. Does anyone know if it's okay to take this with tylenol/acetaminophin? I didn't take any for my headache, bc I was afraid of potential side affects, and I hadn't asked any doctors if it was okay.",5
"Using this drug because of facial and neck glandular swelling,due to an allergic reaction. It has also helped my arthritis in my ankle joint and my asthma. I do however have trouble sleeping. Wake up very early in the am and cannot go back to sleep.",5
"Although the drug helped the inflammation of the artery in the temple area, the side effects are painful.  It was a slow process to reduce the 40 mg down to 2.5 mg but I am still experiencing dizziness, bone acnes, mild headaches, and upset stomach.  I have lost a lot of weight due to the upset stomach.  How long does it take to clear the medication from your system?  I can't seem to get an answer from any doctor - only that it can take a year or more.  Is that true?  Research carefully before taking the drug - it's not worth the side effects.",3
"I TAKE 60MG FOR 3 WEEKS FOR SACORDOIS THAN 40 MG, THEN 20 MG. I TAKE IT WITH LEXAPRO 5 MG IN THE AM.  I HAVE NOT HAD ANY SIDE EFFECTS TO SPEAK OF. I FEEL GREAT,I HAVE ENERGY, A LITTLE CLOUDY AFTER TAKING DOSE IN THE AM. ",5
"skin nearly completely cleared up, joints became mobile again, got a migraine around day 4-6, swelling in hands, face, and legs,  however can deal with the side effects, even the weight gain, wish I could continue this med long term,  after stopping did have a rebound effect of symptoms ( Skin and Joint flare up)",5
"I have had RA for about 6 years most of the time I have been on Pred.  When I first took it I couldn't hardly move and it felt like a miracle.  I have tapered down to 4mg/day and have been concerned about side effects but have seen NO weight gain (no one can believe it), NO bone density loss (I take an occasional calcium supplement), and no other real side effects.  I try to keep my dosage as low as possible and put up with some pain and supplement with Advil.  I have tried the other RA coctails of methotrexate, Hydrochloroquin, etc and they were not any more effective.  I am still worried about long term effects and that I will probably never get off it but it is helping me live better.",4
"Prednisone is very hard to take in large doses. It effects every part of your body, your mind ,your bones and your overall health. I started with 40 MG. it was hard to handle useing the drug. It helped my sarcoidosis but I have to still take it in small doses. I really didn't know much about this drug until I got sick but I hope I never have to be on a high dose again.",5
"I have been taking 10-15 mg. prednisone for about 2 years now for sever Rheumatoid Arthritis. When I have bad flare ups of arthritis, I'm given about 60 mg. for a few days. I have gained 45 pounds! And I have developed the round face.   I hate the way I look, but without the drug I wouldn't be able to walk or even feed myself. I would have no quality of life at all.  However, if I had to do it over, I would think long and hard before I would take this drug. I think my body has gotten use to it and when I've tried to ween off it, I cannot move; I was taken down by 1 mg. per day, I was having problems when I got down to 6 mg. and had to start taking more.   My doctor warned me about the side effects, but I wouldn't listen. I was told once you start on this drug you'll be on it for life and the side effects are bad.  Not only have I gained weight from this drug, it has also begun to weaken my bones and now I have to take Fosamax with D to help control the bone loss, but my last bone density test showed I'm still experiencing bone loss. I've been told that if I fall, I will break my leg, hip or even my back. I have to be very careful walking and need assistance when it is or has snowed or there is ice on the ground - I live in the Cleveland, Ohio area, so that's 6 months out of the year.  This drug can be considered a wonder drug and helps with everything from lung problems, algeries, cancer to arthritis, but the side effects are not worth it.  Unless you need this drug to survive, I would not recommend taking it for a long period of time.  Please think long and hard before taking this drug for a long period of time.  ",4
"I have slight brain and nerve damage from an assault 2 years ago.  I have SEVERE headaches.  My doctor prescribed this with prozac, xanax, and elivail (sp?).  The instructions to take this med was complicated.  3 pills 3 times a day for 3 days then blah..blah..blah.. At the time of this rating I have been off of predisone for 11 days and have gained close to 20lbs.  THAT'S 20 POUNDS!!!!  My face turned red and was grossly inflamed.  I had so much water retention that you could tell which side I slept on the night before all day until, I went to bed that next day!  In my opinion...Predisone is not worth it.  I'm not a vain person, I'm just uncomfortable! Get a massage, it will be better for you anyway.",3

"I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS MEDICATION PREDNISONE ORAL AND DROPS SINCE 1996 TO TREAT A CONDITION CALLED UVEITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE RETINA)BOTH EYES. I HAVE TAKEN VARIOUS DOSAGES FROM MY HIGHEST 140MG DAILY TO CURRENTLY 60MG EVERY OTHER DAY. I MUST SAY THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD BECAUSE AFTER 11 YEARS I CAN STILL SEE. AS A RESULT OF THE LONG TERM USE I AM NOW BIPOLAR WITH OSTEOPENIA (BRITTLE BONES)AND CATARACTS (FINAL SURGERY 4/22/08) (VERY BLURRY BUT I CAN SEE). YES WEIGHT GAIN IS INEVITABLE (40LBS ON A 5'5 FRAME IN A 6 MONTHS)HOWEVER, AN EXERCISE REGIMEN CAN COMBAT THAT PROBLEM. AS FAR AS SLEEP IS CONCERNED WITH USE, I FOUND THAT TAKING THE MEDS EARLIER IN THE DAY AND HAVING A CUP OF HOT DECAFFINATED TEA AT BEDTIME HAS MADE SLEEPING EASIER. THE TINGLING IN MY HANDS AND FEET ARE TO A MINIMUM AND MY APPETITIE IS NO LONGER INCREASED. I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT THIS MEDICATION I WOULD BE BLIND AT THIS TIME. SO AS STATED EARLIER AS FAR AS MY CASE THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD.  WISHING MUCH SUCCESS TO ALL TAKING THIS DRUG.",4

What can I do for the other side effects? Which are muscle pain and weakness.",3

The long term high doses of advil is now giving me hypertension so I need to cut back or change meds. I need advice about taking prednisone long term. I am worried about side effects & hurting my already compromised immune system.",5
"I've used this drug on many occassions and it has always worked for me.  When I get sick my asthma gets very bad and my doctor usually prescribes this drug, it clears up my longs very well.

I threw up non stop for about 7 hours and ended up in the ER still throwing and and extremely dehydrated.  Be careful with stomach viruses.",5

"I have been prescribed Prednisone on several occasions to treat respiratory-related issues such as bronchitis and also a sinus infection. It has worked wonders for me in conjunction with antibiotics.   For me, the interesting side-effect has not been weight gain, but rather weight loss; typically about a pound a day. I was curious if any other asthmatics had similar side effects. ",5
"Family member was prescribed 100 mg. of this medicine.  The last week has been an absolute nightmare.  Turns out that the high dosage of this medicine on top of Prozac induced a manic state.  This person has now been prescribed an anit-psychotic drug to balance the imbalance that was created by this drug.  Symptoms of the manic state included irritability, aggression, states of highs and lows, compulsive shopping, and OCD like behavior.  Very scary and we are hoping to look further into how this actually happened.  No one whould have to go through this.",1
side effects,4
"Don't ever take this stuff unless you have to.  Many doctors (especially orthopedics) prescribe this medicine for muscle or joint injuries, and some doctors prescribe it for COPD/emphysema.  The bottom line is - it supresses your immune system and leaves you open to contracting all kinds of other diseases that could make your condition worse.  When a doctor wants to give you prednisone, RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!  The risks of the medication clearly outweigh the benefits, especially when the patient has multiple chronic diseases in which the immune system is already compromised.",1
"I have been on Prednisone for about 2 years now. It is an extremely long time to be on this medication. Although it is very helpful with keeping my polyps shrunken, and that helps maintaining my pain, but the side effects have really taken their tole. It has taken me a month and a half to ween off of the meds very slowly. My mood, my muscle aches, and mania (bi-polar tendancies) are all wearing me out. My doctor is aware of this so I am coming off of the med, so be careful. ",5
"I have been on prednisone several times since I was diagnosed with Crohn's 10 years ago.  This time around, doctor started me out on 40 mg/day and is tapering down by 10 mg every 2 weeks. Side-effects I have experienced this time are increased appetite, night sweats, insomnia, and acne.  I'm glad that this med helps but the side-effects are frustrating.",5
"In 1998, I was diagnosed with Hep C and an autoimmune disorder which caused severe lung infections when I got a cold or the flu.  It also involved my thyroid.  I initially was put on high dosages (60 mg./day), but whenever I was told to taper down, I would get an infection of one type or another.  In the beginning ONLY did it seem to be a wonder drug - even with the usual side affects.  After 10 years of continual use and varying mg., it has been a slow descent into hell!  I developed osteoporosis, have severe joint deterioration resulting in 2 knee surgeries, one total hip replacement, loss of teeth, the list goes on.  I had been warned by my doctors that being on this drug for a long time was very hard to taper down on with side effects worse than the disease.  Even though I have excellent doctors and was closely monitored, the worsening damage to my kidneys, eyes, liver, bones and muscles has forced the decision to slowly taper down for at least a year.  When I finally got down to 2.5 mgs., the pain and swelling in all my major joints and muscles has been horrific!  My pain doctor has prescribed heavy narcotics to help lessen the joint pain, but even THOSE aren't alleviating it for more than 2-3 hours.  I asked her how long I could expect this ""existence"" (I don't feel like I could even call this ""living"") to last and she said she didn't know because she had never known anyone being on Prednisone for as long as I've been on it.  For those who are just starting this drug, I would strongly suggest to be on a low burst for the shortest time possible recommended by your doctor.  Had I known 10 years ago how much I would be suffering now, I would have researched the effects of VERY long-term use and insisted I only use it temporarily and/or intermittently.  Take heed from my story and the many others like mine on this review site.",5

I thought that it could be from damaged nerves from my back surgery  The pain was soo severe, I could barely walk. I didn't know that it was the meds. that was doing this to me.  I told my dr. about it and he looked at me as if I was crazy!!!  He pulled out his palm pilot and be and behold, one of the side affects was what I was telling him about my legs!!  he told me not to take it anymore but I finished it the day before. I also think that he has caused me to have a yeast infection .  I 've never had one before and I became irritated in my vaginal area when I started taking the medicine.  ",1
I had bronchitis for three weeks and my dr prescribed Prednisone.  I got over the bronchitis but the Prednisone made me gain nine pounds in one week.  I have since gained another twelve pounds and can't seem to lose.  I have never had an issue with my weight until I started the Prednisone.,3
This twice a day along with Ibuprofen 800mg three times a day has let me be able to continue with my everyday tasks as if I didn't have arthritis. I'm currently reacting to this very well but once without it it seems to be more bothersome. I also take this early morning so I can take it again hours before bedtime so it doesn't disrupt my being able to sleep. Hope this helps you.,5

"I was diagnosed with Palendromic Rheumatism (a combination of Lupus and RA) two years ago and was on Plaquenil (which is wonderful) until 6 months ago. I began taking Plaquenil again but unfortunately this med takes at least 2 months to become effective so my Dr prescribed a strange ""step"" schedule for Prednisone until the good medication takes effect. The only side effect that I was warned of by my Dr was mood swings, but he said that my current prescription for Prozak would alleviate this. In the 2 1/2 weeks since I  started taking prednizone I have had less than a total of 20 hours of sleep, I can't go more than 20 minutes without screaming at someone like I'm a two year old having a temper tantrum, I've lost another 15 pounds and still have absolutely no appetite.

"I was diagnosed with Idio-Thrombocytopenia at age 13, and placed on prednisone the very next day.  I was on this medicine for a little over 2 years, and I feel like it had minimal help.  I had to grow out of my condition(per my Dr).   I took 100mg/day for the first 14 months, then started by wheening process in the 15th month, where I went down to 90 mg, and on down to where I was taking 2.5mg/day for a month or so at the end.  I gained 145 lbs in 5 weeks.  It was very difficult for me, being that I was entering my freshman year of high school and I went from a thick 180, to 325 in what seemed like it was overnight.  I suffered from puffy face, trouble sleeping, depression, and the worst was the stomach issues.  It totally shut off my periods for about 2 1/2 yrs.  I have been off this medicine since Sept 97, and I have permanent effects from this medicine.  I still have a highly sensitive stomach, I have had to take birth control for years to maintain a normal monthly cycle, my body has been producing (in my dr's words) astronomical amounts of insulin, to where i'm at a pre-diabetic stage.

"I have adult onset asthma since age 40 that has been in hibernation for many years. My rescue inhaler is pretty old so when I got a viral infection recently that caused my asthma  [possibly bronchitis] to act up after getting no satisfaction from my Maxair Autohaler, I took Prednisone and it was like a miracle for me. Within minutes my coughing  calmed down and I could actually relax.   I have had to take Prednisone a handful of times over the years and never experienced any bad side effects. Since I'm always hungry and love to eat anyway, I wouldn't be able to say whether my appetite increased. My weight is normal for my height so adding a few pounds wouldn't deter me from using Prednisone. No problem sleeping as I take it in the morning with food.   My hubby took it for arthritis for a few years and has a mild shakiness in his hands now which sucks but it made his phantom limb pain disappear which was great.   I would not recommend taking it for anything other than short term. I have read the risk sheet. You can do an internet search and read it - I highly recommend doing that.

"Caution: take on a very short term basis due to the side effects.  You may not have them now but believe me they will probably appear eventually or when you start to taper off this drug.  ATTENTION: For RA or Hepitis C, joint pain sufferers out there talk to your doctor about a biologic called Kinert.  Look it up on this web site.  One shot subQ given each day and all of the symptoms of Still's disease are gone without any side effects. My husband can give his own shots or I give them to him.  He is diabetic and so another shot is not a big deal. It has been over a month now.   My husband had severe joint pain.  Not RA but actually Adult Still's Disease. The side effects are so bad that I had to quit my job to care for my husband, due to the horrible side effects of feelings of suicide, feels crazy all the time, feelings of total uselessness, great fatique but after sleeping does not feel rested,  biting his hands, gnashing of teeth, screaming out "" I can't take this anymore"" over and over, hitting his head with his hands.  He and I wonder why any doctor would prescribe this for a patient unless they just don't care about the patient to ignore the possibility of long term side effects.  He has finally been tapered off but I fear that it stays in your system for many months after discontinuing Prednisone.  Kinert is expensive but your doctor can plead with Medicare or your insurance company for you to receive ths biologic.  It's all in how they write the letter. ",1
"After suffering for almost 2 weeks with this crazy new flu, I finally went to the doctor because I was waking up weezing at night.

I can breathe from my toes to my head, my sinuses are not killing me and my back has quit hurting. I am coughing up alot of ""lung crud"" and I feel like the prednisone is opening up my lungs and allowing everything to come up easier. I know that antibiotice can't cure the flu, but ther is no denying I feel like a new woman. I would recommend this mixture to anyone. Unfortunately from the postings I've been reading, many people have different reactions to prednisone and it is a ""hit and miss"" as to your own body's reaction. My minor skin psorisis is also enjoying the presciption. Hope anyone who needs it can handle it. God Bless- ",5

"I had shortness of breath for many months, which suddenly got worse.  Was hospitalized and put on 60mg of prednisone every 8 hours via iv. Have been on it for nearly a month now, tapering down the dose by 5 mg every 3 days.  Now I am finishing up on the 5 mg dosing.  This drug made my symptoms actually worse.  Dr. could not figure out why I was not getting any better after 3 weeks of using this drug for exacerbation of asthma.  It made me insulin dependent diabetic, made my voice into a gravel pit, I had the most horrendous headaches, and still continued with shortness of breath, with no improvement while on this med, weight gain, vision changes, water retention which required lasix, then potassium replacement because of the potassium loss from the lasix, from the prednisone. Trembling, shaking, confusion, unable to work, not being able to sleep without major drugs, on doses higher than 5 mg per day from the prednisone. People say that this drug helps them breath better, but in my case, it actually made me worse. It was a horrible experience, and after nearly a month, I am beginning to feel better after the dose has been tapered down to 5 mg a day. Be careful with this drug, the side effects are nasty.  ",2

I started taking 60 mg/day and now am at the 40 mg/day week of the taper without any side effects that I had always heard about.  I suppose the fact that I had lost 27 lbs in the 4 weeks in the hospital with no food may mean that the weight issues cannot be seen because of my extreme underweight at the present.  I am sure that the prednisone was the only thing that stopped the debilitating pain of the ulcerative colitis.  So, yes, it has been very good for me. ",5

I recently spent over 6 mths weaning myself off, w/ Dr.'s care of course, and have lost all the weight. It took nearly a year to stop and I only took 5mgs 2x a day. I also suffered a severe reaction initially, which lead to a 3 day hospital stay due to a kidney infection, somehow triggered by the absence of pred. The whole experience helped me realize I need to find other ways to relieve my pain. Meditation and visualization techniques mainly. I have also learned to listen to my body and respect my limits, which has still left me battling depression. It's hard for everyone around me to even begin to understand how difficult this is and how it limits me when I otherwise look healthy (the only exception being localized swelling of my wrists). I actually hurt in every joint all the time, but especially stiff & painful in the a.m., my spine being the only exception. I just wish I had been better informed by my Dr. of alternative therapies and techniques I could've utilized to treat my initial ""flare"" & get it ""under control"". I still have good days and bad days, just like when I took prednisone but now I wake feeling rested instead of feeling like I never slept @ all and barely being able function even w/ coffee ALL day long. Now I have energy to do  what I have to, take care of myself & my family. I also find myself thinking clearly, and am able to concentrate again. I highly recommend ACUPUNCTURE along with Biologics and meditation( I take Humira ).

Has definitely changed my qualtiy of life to zero. Depression is now a battle. When Dr. told of all the side effects seems disinterested or dismisses them as not related to prednisone. My life consists of tossing and turning in pain all night. Getting up at 7:00AM only to fall asleep in chair until 12:00PM got to work and repeat the same process day after day.

By 2000 I had to have the other hip replaced. This was damage all due to taking the prednisone in large doses for a long period of time.

I have never felt such horrible stomach pains before. I think it gave me an ulcer. On days I took it I definitely felt different in a weird way.

So he is better ON the drug then OFF.. His only side effect is a mild case of diarrhea every now and then. Its hard knowing to stop a drug or stay on it because you have a few side affects that might make you unconfortable for a while. We had to look at the long range affects for him.

My support group all warned how horrible this drug was but I was thankful.....at first! Now a year later I can say I have suffered so many of the horrible side effects.  I have had drug-induced hepatitis, which restricted me from my pain relieving antiinflammatory drugs. I had to switch to narcotics which did not help my RA at all, I lost mobility and overall function.  I then developed Cushings syndrome, I looked horrible and felt worse. I experienced sleeplessness, irritability, sudden weight gain, stretch marks, rash after rash, facial hair ( noy cool for a 20 something woman!) And really too many side efects to list.  This drug might help your symptoms but I don't know that the side effects are worth the relief.  Honestly, I can't wait to get off it and never look back!  P.S.

When I have periods of inflamation (trigeminal neuropathy, swelling of the joints and extremities, extreme pain, muscle inflammation, and fatigue) my Dr. puts me on 60mgs. for 2 weeks and then tapers me off.  I don't have problems with the drug other than it keeps me awake if I take it at night.  I do not have the stomach problems people complain of and I am not generally on it long enough to have the organ responses that can be associated with it.  Typically my symptoms will go away completely within the first 10 days and by the time I taper off I am symptom free.  I'm usually symptom free for 4 to 6 months at a time, though my remissions are much shorter each time.  Never-the-less, if I take the Prednisone for a couple of weeks my system will usually right itself.

I have severe COPD and my doctor won't presribe Prednisone for me.  My cardiologist thinks it would be beneficial.  I am 85 yrs and getting older.,5
"Not really sure why this was prescribed to me.  I have been sick off and on for 3 months now.  Symptoms vary day to day.  Fever, stuffy head and sinuses, trouble breathing, chest congestion, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, ect...  I was given this and an antibiotic and symptoms have gone away.  I have not noticed any side effects (thank goodness from others I have read on here) but not really sure why this was given to me with all of them listed.  Don't really think it was worth the worrying...",3
it seems to be changing my body in ways i did not expect. ,3
"I have taken prednisone for the last 14 years. I have osteoporosis, thin and compromised skin, hypertension, and severe digestive issues as a result of this treatment. But, it is the only drug that has worked for me. ",5
Subscribed for a period of time caused major swelling of my face and throat area which was very uncomfortable,4
It helps keep me functioning.........even on an extremely low dose.,4
I been taking it for about two weeks and no change,1
Good medication but the side effects are HORRIBLE. I gained 50 lbs in 5 years!!!1 ugh,4
It works but there's hell to pay with the side effects.,5
"I have bruised so much I'm going to the wound care clinic for both legs. All I did was bump them. My hands are all blue, my face is fat, I have a stomach now, and I'm losing  my hair..I'm only on 6 mgs now for the last month..Terrible stuff, but I probably couldn't get around without it..trying to lower it, but my sed rate went up so I'll have to stay with 6mgs. I also take methotrexate for the same condition, but I don't know that anything is helping me yet.....",1
almost killed me masking other problems! diverticulitous to name one,1
"Treated for chronis sinusitis. I am having surgery soon and the doctor wanted to try to reduce the inflamation. I am on 40 mg for 3 days, 20 for 2 days, 10 for 3 days. However, I took one dose of 40 and within about 12 hours, I had an irregular heart beat (a condition I already have - though in rare instances and my docs call it 'harmless'). This med made it much worse. I was having a'flip-flopping' heart about every 15 minutes today. I have the following side effects also: skin is noticeably red, I can't think clearly, dizzy, blurred vision, night sweats, trouble sleeping, headache, joint pain in shoulder, hip, knee, numbness in right hand, just plain feeling awful. I notice I'm also jittery and jumpy and I'm starting to get quite irratated at things I don't normally get irratated with. I'm sure this drug works well for most people. My mom had a reaction to steroids when I was younger so maybe there's something in my genes that make it intolerable for me. It probably is very effective for treating my chronis sinus problems but I haven't been able to take enough to notice. ",1
relief from hives itching due to allergies; stress etc.,5
It makes me nervous and I can't stop eating !,3
"This is the wrost vtreatment for Lupus. This medication WILL make you feel better but in acutality you are not. This medication casued me to have early stages of glaucoma, diabetes, joint deterioration, kidney infections. mood swings, loss of apeptite and insomnia. Alot of people dont experiance these side effects because they onkly use the medication for things such as asthma, rashes and so on. There are other drugs that are just as effective and less harmful. Prednisone is a cheap fix with a bunch of side effects.",1
"I hate this drug, I have been on it twice now. The first time I had an acne break out on my chest and face, I'm taking measures to make sure this dosent happen the second time. Increased appetite and swelling of the face also occured. This drug works well for me but I hate being on it, plus it takes forever to taper off.",4
My husband and I both take this med for our asthma and coughing. It does work for us but makes us eat more. Clears up our coughing in less then 3 days. Its helpful to us. We take it as needed from doctor not every month.,5
"I have been managing atopic dermatitis my whole life and I take a 5 day pill pack when I get to the point that I cannot live with the symptoms (which may be 1 - 4 times per year).  By the end of the week the redness, itching and sores are gone.  I get a huge amount of relief from this drug for my condition.",5
"PLEASE BE WARNED that sometimes this drug can cause sudden and unexplained feelings of being suicidal!  I experienced this, and I am a licensed psychotherapist!  Some of my patients have mentioned this, too, and doctors don't do a good job of warning people.  It will pass, but talk to your doctor about it or a significant other.  ""They"" don't warn us enough that this can happen!!",4
"I am a chronic asthmatic, who only takes 50mg for 5-7 days and hope to God I get better. My body is addicted to this medication. My Doctor and I will do anything in our power to avoid using this drug. Unfortunately this time I could not avoid using the Prednisone this time. I strongly urge people who read this to seriously question your doctor as to do you really need this medication. What could be the serious side effects to using this drug short time to long time. I have 30 years experience with this drug. I have had many moods changes while on it and not for the better. If you  feel that your grip on your emotions while on this medication, it is not your imagination. You really are having mood swings, anger, upset, depression, you may also feel very well, kinds like uphoria, but only while on the medication Prednisone. The side effects coming off the med, is something else. depression, lifelliness, mood swings, positive & negative.  Be Very careful with this medication, it is very dangerous if your doctor doesn't really know much about it. Seek a second opinion. If you have a condition that requires this med. regularly please try to go on a lower dose as possible to prevent becoming addicted, either mind wise or body wise, it is possible to be addicted to it body wise (which is that you keep getting sick, after each use of this medication.) Being addicted with your mind is like drinking alcohol and can't stop. Please be cautious with this medication. I try to only go on it 2-3 a year with careful observation, I leave a message for my doctor with his staff, if need be I  am in his office that day, or next day to monitor me, and change the plan of attack on the asthma, or to make sure I am not getting sicker.",4
I get cranky -- swollen face--weight gain--swollen ankles. ,4
"This drug has made my life incredibly difficult.  I'm 17 years old and I took this drug to stop the swelling from an infection in my eye (that was close to my macula).     After taking this drug my face swelled up like a balloon.   My whole personality changed.   I broke windows in my house.   I did crazy stuff, it just ruined my life.   Made me almost crazy I felt.  I had anxiety attacks so bad that i couldn't breath.  I also went from 130 pounds to 150 pounds.  But after they took me off the drug I lost about 20 pounds in 4 days.  I've been off the medication now for about 4 months.   I still have times when I can't control my angry.  ( this never happened before I took the medicince before) I have terrible acne over my face, back, and chest.     I would just really consult with your doctor before taking this drug becuase for me it wasn't worth it.",1
"Pred was used in our 5 yr old daughter for an asthma treatment. It worked fantastic although was extremely difficult to administer. She vomited the liquid, and vomited crushed pills in pudding. I finally had to get her to take it like we would but it was with much gagging and occ vomiting. ",5
Took only 2 doses to take affect,5
"I have a herniated disc and Sciatica. I have been taking this drug  as the doctor said it would stop inflammation and swelling so that I could begin to heal. While it has helped with my initial systems of pain, tingling and numbness in my legs..I am now experiencing horrible muscle and joint pain in other parts of my body..dry mouth, hypertention at night, and uncomfortable water retention..hopefully i'll heal quickly so i can get off this stuff. The side effects are horrible!!!",3
"This medication made me very sick to my stomach. I could not hold down food for several days. I also was very weak and dizzy, and could not sleep. although the medicine worked the side effects where horrible.",4
"I have HCV & should never have been prescribed this medicine. DO NOT TAKE IT, as it has caused side effects. It was a difficult drug.",4
"Poison ivy.  I had such a severe case I was ready to take a razor to my blisters (which happened to be on my wrists.)  When I got the scrip, I read ALL of the side effects.  There are MANY scary ones. But thank goodness for prednisone.  Tell your doctor EVERYTHING before you let him/her prescribe this dangerous drug.",5
"My Condition: Severe Cluster/Migraine Headaches -- emergency room severity, extreme debilitation! Cause: Tree/grass pollen, specifically Pine Trees Explanation: Overexposure, usually in the spring or fall or both leads to swollen sinuses or swollen neck glands or both making it difficult to breathe through my nose resulting in cold like symptoms, ie. stopped up nose, runny nose, scratchy eyes, etc... Excessive blowing of my nose results in swollen blood vessels behind my eyes. Reduced blood flow as a result of inflammed blood vessels coupled with stopped up sinuses begins the on-slaught of headaches.  I went through 8 different Dr.'s over a period of 1-2 years (in the 1980's) before I found adequate treatment. I have used prednisone about 14 times over the last 25 years to correct this problem. Sometimes, prednisone is used with either an antibodic or antihistimine or both. My doseage: 40mg per day for 3 days followed by 20mg per day for 3 days followed by 10mg per day for 3 days (total 9 days) Result: Reduces inflammed blood vessels and inflammed and swollen sinuses, allows free flow of mucus, returns condition to clear and normal usually within 4-5 days after beginning prednisone treatment with NO more problems or symptoms. Prevention: Stay away from trees, pine trees Comments: A Miracle Drug!!!",5
able to breath again,5
" I have Sarcoidosis that affects my lungs. I have been on Prednisone for 30+ years and have been able to maintain a good level of health with exercise and activities I desire to do. I have faith in the Lord and feel this and prayer is a vital part of getting along so well while on this medication. My Doctors have been helpful in listening and prescribing my meds. I have been on a dose of 2.5 mg daily for the last several years. At one time I was on 10 mg daily, then 5 mg   daily. I have had to increase the dose as much as 20mg for 3 days and then taper back down after I had chronic bronch. That was several years ago. I do take the flu shot and usually get maybe 1 or 2 colds during cold and flu season. The medication has helped when I have gotten short of breath and had to increase it for few days to 10 mg. then taper back down. The past 2 yrs the Doctor has had me to use Azmacort and Albuteral inhalers when I had wheezing and shortness of breath and not increase the Prednisone. It has helped me. Overall, taken as directed this medication has worked pretty good for me.   ",4
Weight Gain,5
"I had a reaction to a antibiotic, and was put on Prednisone for the rash and inflamation. I also suffer from Fibromysia. The prednisone gave me 10 days of complete painfree/energy/focus/ and lack of depression. Too bad the side effects are so intense that it couldn't be used to treat this painful disorder.",5
"I have Dermatomyositis.  This drug is a miracle drup with regard to treatment -- unfortunately I gain wight (20lbs) each time I'm on it.  Once off, the weight comes off.  I CRAVE sugar on it.  At high doses (60mg)  I get manic -- but I'm susually not on large dosed for long.  It's the necessary eavil.",5
Can't stand the heart palpitations.,3
"i've been on this for 4 months now, and I feel horrible, my face is swollen. depressed, sleep deprivation, mood swings, can't wait to get off this,,,,this is horrible and the bitter taste is not fun",4
"i felt really relaxed, and i slept all day. although i'm still waiting for my rash to go away.  ",3
"This med is horrible. it makes me feel incredibly jittery and nervous. Makes my anxiety skyrocket. It DOES work charms on my asthma however. Also, the taste is so painfully bitter...",3
"Weight gain, depression, sleep deprivation, thrush, headache, increased appetite, and this drug did not improve my platelet count enough to constitute use.",2
"I have been experiencing very painful cramp like pains from top of stomach, then up throat through to back and into right jaw then burning into ear. muscles in back are sore afterwards. peppermint tea helps a bit. ",3
I use either the 10mg or 20mg tab to treat when I feel an attack of my MS coming on. It seems to quell my tingling feelings and then finally go away. I hope this helps others in evaluating this drug for their use. I have a bottle handy and only take this med when I feel an attack coming on.,4
"very unpleasant. Hard to sleep, stomach puffs out, feels very hungry and edgy. but it does help with the breathing.",4
The predisone was worse than the hives. I gained 40 pounds and my joints are swollen and painful. I feel years older than I am. My face has also had a severe acne breakout.,5
"It made me feel faint, dizzy, and ill feeling.  I still feel like this. It has been 2 weeks since I took it. It was given to me for pneumonia.I still feel week and not myself.",1
"It was prescribed for me for severe pharyngitis. I took the full course as directed, but it did not even begin to shrink my tonsils.",1
"bulging disk. (C 5)disk. This is a flare up from an initial disk problem 18 years ago, this time seems to be as painful as the first one. I am takin Methlprednisolone 4 mg.

What physical limitations should I use? Thanks, Robert Keeton",3
"Predisone-I am taking for COPD, RA, and  fibromyagia currently I am on 20mg per day 10 am and 10 pm. I have been taking this drug for about 10 yrs but not at the current levels.My Rheumatologist does not like for me to be at these levels but understands the results with COPD, and left sided heart failure. thanks Dr. William D. Moore PhD.",5
blood sugar up and very moody,4
"I have rather severe sinusitis that periodically gets out of control and then causes athsma.  In short, my ENT physician tells me that if I don't stay on at least 5mg of prednisone daily, I will die. Rats. I hate this stuff! When I get infections and the resulting difficulty breathing, I have to go up to 40mg daily and then taper down to my regular 5mg daily dose. Well, there goes sleeping for another month! My wife told me that she hates predinisone because I get nasty- I responded that I didn't care.  Normally, I would have cared, but the prednisone made me so nasty that I didn't care. When I'm on the 40mg dose, I try to tell everyone I talk to that I'm on prednisone so they won't think I'm a jerk. Screws up my vision, want to eat EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME! Can't think, can't function- but I can breathe...",4
The side affects of this med. are not worth the minimal relief I personally have seen. This is the third go round and if prescribed again I will decline any further oral steroids.,2
"The drug from hell. Swelling, inability to sleep, severe vision disturbances, drove my blood sugar up to danger levels (never was diabetic before using this drug!), sent me to the ER with symtoms of stroke which turned out to be fluid build up behind my retina which caused flashing 'lights', etc. Was taken off the drug after the second dose!",1
"I've been taking this prednisone for 15 years - as much as 60 mg daily down to 5 mg daily (for a short period of time each).  Although definitely it has helped me throughout my illness, the side effects are frustrating to deal with especially when doing well on a low dosage and then it has to be increased suddenly because of an increase in CPK level.  About two years ago my doctor told me it was causing an increase in my blood glucose and I'm now considered a Type II diabetic and taking an oral med and pricking my finger at least once a day to monitor.  Until then I was mostly concerned with my fat intake, now I worry about carb intake all the time too.  I'm aware of many other potential serious side effects and it seems some are possibly making themselves known which I'll find out more in the next few months after a few tests.  Some of this I'm sure has to do with the illness itself but I think what this drug and the immunosuppressant I take also does to the body after an extended period of time maybe does more harm than good.  Overall though it has helped me I think for these years.  The jury is still out.",4
"This seems to be the only medicine that keeps me from going into the hospital. BUT, I hate the side effects: hunger, nervousness, loss of sex drive, can't sleep, night sweats, moodiness, swelling. After 2 years, I wonder what else is going on in my body...",4
Made me extremely nervous. Trouble sleeping. headaches.sob.Noticed scratchy throat/voice 2nd week.blood sugar increase. increase thirst.weakness.,3
"I am taking this drug for the first time. I am only taking a tapered prescription of 10mg- then to 5mg, then 2.5. I am taking it for an inflamtion in my inner ear to drain fluid out. Today is my first day on it and I have to say the pressure in my ear feels better already so thats great... but i recommend to anyone who is taking this drug in small amounts for a shirt time is eat! eat! when you take it and then an hour after. I founf myself  feeling dizzy, and out of sorts at first but I found eating helped even though i had eaten a big meal with the pill i needed more food about 2 hours later when the drug started to kick in. ON the whole it works but doesn;'t make me feel great.",5
"I have Giant Cell Arteritis.  I have been taking prednisone for 18 months.  The drug immediately gave me relief from an excrutiating headache.  The side effects have not been pleasant.  I gained weight, experienced insomnia, lost hair, and bruised easily. I am currently under the care of a rheumatologist and I am trying to ""wean"" off slowly.  My hope is my condition will be in remission soon. ",4
"i was 18 when i took this drug to rid my body of its dependency on OTC pain killers (i was thought to be having rebound headaches). I had a horrible reaction. Fever, rash, vomiting, muscle weakness, dizziness... it was so bad that I couldn't finish the pills. If it works for you, great, but my doctor and I discovered I am allergic to it",1
Treated for low blood platelets.  Count raised from 26 to 46.  Hemoglobin and white blood cell counts also increased about 15%.  Discontinued prednisone after 6 weeks due to potential side effects.  My blood counts seem to have stabilized.,4
Been on this for 15 mos to treat symptoms of auto-immune disease - now on maintenance dose of 10mg daily. 62 y.o. female.  What side effects can I expect if I stay on this long term?  I am physically very active.How does in interact with Cromolyn?,5
I take it for fibromyalgia and lupus; so far it's been the most effective treatment for keeping flares at bay. Without it I probably could not work.,5
without it I cannot even walk,5
"every time I take this drug I get hiccups that wont go away for about 2 days after I'm finished taking them. not fun to have asthma, sinusites and the hiccups at the same time BUT it cleared my lungs up enough to have my sinus sergury",3
"I was dizzy, vomiting, had a pounding heart, couldn't sleep or fall asleep, was confused, exhausted, and it didn't make the rash I had any better. In fact it spread more. ",1
"This is scary stuff - took it for 4 days, had poison oak, presnisone dried it right up then caused hives, racing heart, high blood pressure, inablity to sleep.  Next time I will use a homopathic remedy to deal with poison osk!  Never again!",5
"Sudden weight gain, bones ache, hands & face swollen,hands also dry from being on this med for 19 days",2

Watch your bone health,5
"I have a painful L5-S1 herniated disc, causing excruciating pain when standing or walking in my lower back & upper leg.  Use of other anti-inflammatory drugs had no noticable effect. After the first dose of Prednisone, there was a DRAMATIC reduction in the pain level, although some sciatica discomfort remains.  I exercise often and am in pretty good shape, but I'd been having difficulty in walking due to the stabbing pain, and now can walk with little discomfort at all.  I'm being cautious about the stomach problems that can result, taking Prilosec daily, but so far, so good.  Highly recommended.",4
"I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. On 10/30, I was hospitalized with an acute flare up. The prednisone has definately made a difference in the pain I have encountered over the last 4 months, but the side effects are horrible. After a week on 40mg/day, the doc cut the prescription in half because I was going into a psychotic episode. I have had a headache for 3 days, feel desolate, can't sleep, can't stop eating, and on and on. It's nice to be pain-free but I don't know how long I can stay on this drug.",5
"Prednisone is not great for everyone, but it has been a miracle drug for me, even at a low dosage. I have cervical spinal stenosis, cervical degenerative disc disease (which is spreading down my back), and osteoarthritis. All of these cause severe pain in my neck, head and back and has caused me to become Disabled due to the pain and immobility. I am adjusting to a new regimen but for me, my mood (depression and anxiety) has improved and thus far, I have not had the ravenous appetite that causes people to gain weight on this drug. Part of my eating plan is to eat small meals and to eat more protein than what is usual for me. I've learned what foods make you feel full and it does work. Currently I alternate days with 5mg and then 10mg. The very severe pain that I've had for nearly 4 years is gone. I lived mostly in terrible pain in bed with ice packs on my head and neck. I still have pain but it's sooo much better and I'm now trying to learn how to improve the tone and strength of my body. I suggest to people with severe chronic pain who have tried other treatments and don't want to go the route of narcotics, to try prednisone. You and your doctor need to monitor it and not everyone responds the way I have. I hope thought that many of you do find relief because along with relief comes the sense of having HOPE in your life again. Best Wishes.",5
"After 5 weeks of increasingly severe chronic headache, a diagnosis of ""Giant Cell Temporal arteritis"" was confirmed by biopsy. Treatment: 60mg/day Prednisone oral. Symptoms were almost immediately alleviated. This drug has probably saved my eyesight, and possibly my life.",5
"My fingers were swollen and I could not bend them. After step therapy, I was able to reduce the swelling and regain the dexterity that I needed to do my work.",4
I absolutely HATED this drug! It made me very irriatable and made me want to get into fights with everyone around me.  I don't reccomend this drug at all.  ,3

I have been taking prednisone on and off for years. During treatment it is the only time I look and feel normal. I have Tumid Lupus. which is when my immune system attacks my skin leaving me with angry red hive-like marks everywhere. I would recommend this to anyone who truely needs it. You just have to learn to deal with the side effects.,5
"I'm having major side effects. My face and neck are covered in thick dark hair, my face is three times its regular size around, my voice is deeper and courser - I've gained weight although I am being very careful.

"I have sufferd with severe sinus infections for years. I saw an ENT doctor for alergy tests, but because I take Klonopin, he says the tests won't work. What can I do? Isn't ther some way I can be tested since I have to take the Klonopin? SICK AND HAD IT!!",1

"I have used Prednisone tablets in my asthma/bronchitis/ABPA treatment program for decades.  My asthma seems to be adequately controlled by other drugs.  But when my chronic bronchitis or ABPA flares up, then a combination of Prednisone and an antibiotic is effective in clearing up the problem, in concert with a good chest decongestant medicine like Mucinex.  Generally, my highest dosage is 30 mg per day, but I have had a couple of really bad flare ups where I required 40 mg per day to get me through it.  Generally I use a 2-3 week taper regimen.  My maintenance dose is 10mg per day.  I also suffer from ABPA, which may explain why I can't seem to completely get off of the Prednisone.  Side effects seem limited to sleeplessness, retention of fluid, nervousness, and loss of bone density.",5
"Started out on 20mg per day and the relief to swelling and stiffness in my joints was wonderful! Then reduced dose by 50% (as directed) and within a day or two was worse than before. Now, after about seven days on the lower dose, I am starting to improve once more.",5

"eye pain accompanied by blurriness, mental confusion, nervousness, irratability, and bloating",4

Does not seem to have any affect,1
some mild nausea,5
"It has taken most of the inflammation ou of my eye, but it looks like I will still have pain there to live with. ",4
I know side effect of this medication is not good but it keeps me my colon from inflammation repeatedly.   I have been on and off of prednisone at different dosages,5
"HATE the way i feel on prednisone. weight gain, constant hunger, mood swings, screwing with my new marriage!!! have to find alternative!",2

I have been on a 40mg a day dose for about 3 weeks now and can finally walk, SLEEP a whole entire night without pain, my severe debilitating headaches have disappeared, the arthritic pain in my hands and heals have improved tremendously.  For me, the only side effect is heart burn, but I can deal with that considering it has given me part of my life back!  I do not know what I will do if they taper me back off of it. I think, for me and my conditions, the risks of staying on this drug, far out-way the long term side effects.  I can finally get out of a recliner and enjoy my daughter that just turned five!  I want to be able to walk and remember her wedding and hopefully, someday--grandchildren, and if taking prednisone is the only drug that will do that for me, then so be it!  PLUS, I am finally sleeping through the night on it.  I couldn't sleep beforehand b/c I was in so much pain; now I am sleeping from 9pm - 5am every night.  It's a miracle for me!",5
"I'm taking atenolol for high blood pressure and it caused my bronchial tubes to slightly swell up so my doctor put me on this, and a few other medicines.

The pain and stiffness and fatigue always dramatically improve with this drug.,5
"Prednisone ""fog"" side effects, weight gain, moon face, swelling, mustache, grouchiness, insomnia and bone loss, all side effects...but better than flaring with Crohn's I guess.

I have my life back.,5

"every side effect possible!  I got cushing's syndrome, diabetes, humpback, sweating, weight gain, SEVERE osteonecrosis.  horrible experience.",3
So many terrible side effects.. I had to stay out of school. I had diabetes for a month because of how long I was on the drug. It is really rough on your body.,4
I took 6 tabs 10 mg of prendisone,2
"Within a day I seen results, swelling went down and within a week my skin was completly clear with no side effects.",5
I'm dissatisfied with the after affects of this drug. I've taken it before without side-effects until this time. I had most of the side effects - some serious and had to stop dosage early. one week later still coming off of the med. with some side effects lingering. I never want to use this again!! ,5
I have GCA. Started at 60mg. Went down as low as 10mg but am back to 17.5 mg.,4
"This is my second course of Prednisone. I ended up in the ER. First Course 3 days 3 pills 3 days 2 pills etc.- Didn't work... now on 3 pills five days 2 pills five days etc. ... hope it works but I'm still acute. Side effects.. not sleeping as much, shaky.. take pepcid for stomach upset... ask your doctor. Back pain turned out to be upset stomach from Prednisone! ",3
"Loss of appetite from ulcerative colitis led to extreme weight loss and anemia. Prednisone returned appetite to normal and weight returned to normal. After slow withdrawal from 20 mg dosage, appetite stayed normal.",5
The symptoms have not gone away in 4 days.,1
I have gained a huge amount of weight on Prednisone. You don't have to even over eat at all. I have anxiety attacks also and mood swings.,5
"This drug has made my pain more easy to cope with,but it has given me an unblievable appetite. I feel it has given me more energy,I don't feel the need to lie down for a nap like I did before,I will continue to use Prednisone as long as my doctor lets me.",5
"In simple terms, this drug has pulled me out of an asthma attack on many occasions.",5
"7mg per day has made my pain disappear! Swelling, morning stiffness are much decreased. Have stopped the 600 to 900 mg of ibuprofen altogether.",5
"This drug has been very effective in controlling my Lupus over the years.I have dealt with the minor side effects of weight gain, moon face, decrease in sex drive but the worst side effect was I now have Avascular Necrosis (AVN) in my right wrist and both hips. The wrist is great since surgery in 1996. The hips are not good. I had a vascularized fibular graft on the left in 2001 and a rod insertion to the right in 2003. Now I am currently in recovery from a total left hip replacement. The right will need to be done some years down the road. The little issue of AVN that the doctors never told me at the start as made my life hell.",5
"60 mg per day (3 doses of 20 mg) to help w/treatment of Takayasu.  Sleep is hard to come by.  Dizzy spells, hot flashes and ""moon face"".",4
"Since starting 40mg of predisone I was nervous at first, like I had taken a hit of speed..now its mellowed out some....can't sleep well, break out in sweats. But my symptoms have improved. Not sure if the side effects are worth it though.",3
"Prednisone causes my face to flush. And have a bad headache. Can feel my heart beating as I lay in bed. the flushing has happened before when I had a shot for shoulder. This time took pill. Sweating and headache happened. should I ever take this again? the Dr. had me not take the rest of prescription,I had only taken ONE pill.",2
"This medicine makes me sweat constantly, increased hunger, swelling, and mood swings.",3
it makes me swell,5
"my face swelling, tried,very nerves, sad, lone, trouble sleeping,mad, angle, weight grade,any more",3
I used Prednisone for a bad case of poison ivy. This medication rid my face of the poison and left me with the worst acne of my life!! I thought I was having a nightmare about high school!! YIKES!  ,5
"extreame dizzyness, mood swings, hot flashes in my face, difficulty focusing eyes, sleeplessness, weight gain, round face, pressure behind eyes, headaches ",4
"Although I fear the side effects and have only been on this medication for 4 months, the burning in my hands has stopped and I have no pain whatsoever. I'm only taking 5 mg but believe I have gained weight (have no scale but skirt is tight) and that really upsets me. My doctor said my body might get used to the medication and I could lose any weight gain. Hope this is true. ",4
my bad case of poison ivy was controlled in a day and gone in 3 days.  what a relief!,5
I have been very satisfied with how I am doing and feeling.  I was at a point I was waking up stiff and feeling constant pain.  I am almost a new person,5
This is such a difficult drug for me. My body seems to react differently every time. It usually does wonders for my asthma but will make me stay awake for over 50 hours at a time and really interferes with my regular routine. ,3
"this drug has given me part of my life back ! i can do thing with my hands now.also i am getting back ,to love making w/ my husband.",3
"way to much weight gain, and it takes forever to taper off of it",4
body rashes even vegina rashe also bleeding stool,1
"The blisters will go away while taking the medicine but they always return when the medicine is gone and the pain is worse.  The doctor does not know what the problem is or how to cure it I have been to three doctors and they all still do not know what the problem is, all test come back negitive, no infection or disease. But I do not want to be on this medicine the rest of my life.  ",3
I have taken many high dose steriods courses over a 20 some years and the side effects are not that great but the overall effectiveness is wonderful.  ,4
"First of all, I took prednisone for an extended period. The symptoms I had were: weight gain (about 25-30 pounds), round face, acne, and terrible mood swings. I hated every minute of being on this drug.",4
weight gain,3
"I am allergic to neoprene & found out the hard way.  I had a horrible allergic reaction and had to be taken to the hospital.  The doctor prescribed a cycle of Prednisone.  While it helped to cure my allergic reaction, I really suffered from side effects:  weight gain, sleep loss, and major irritibility.  While it did what I needed it to do, I felt horrible while on it.",5
"Took away the pain while on it but the pain comes back when i stopped. Suffered from several side effects of trouble sleeping, blurry vision, fast heartbeat and anxiety.",4
The inside of my mouth has gotten very sore,5
it  taste  horrible  ,3
episodes of blurry vision ,4
kills the arthritus pain in my body and joints,5
I was perscribed this drug for a skin irritation in My mouth. It helped at first then after abt 6 weeks I tried to wean Myself off but guess I did it topo fast. I now have a rash on My arms & legs along with weight gain. I am going to make an appointment ASAP to see the Doctor as soon as I can.,1

It makes me have angered feelings..and it has also made me go into atrial fib twice.  I just have to be very careful when I take it. But I also breathe better ..so there are pro's and cons..,4
"it worked--got rid of the alergic reaction, but I am 48 hrs from last dose and still feeling the shakes and retaining water.  just how long does this crap stay in the system?",5
couldnt breathe  without this,5
causes weight gain that has been hard to loose even almost 2 years after treatment ended and acne I WAS MISERABLE!!!!!!!!,4
"It works wonders but I pay with a decrease in vision (blurriness) and nervousness.   My appetite has increased to the point I am always hungry.  My complexion is red, but I believe it is redder now.  I couldn't live without prednisone, my asthma was out of control.  I'll take any of these side effects.  ",5
"have some side effects (very hungry, shortness of breath). took for poison ivy",5
"worked with alot of side effects, though none were sever enough to stop the med.",4
i HAVE DERMATOMYOSITIS. ITS AN UNCOMMON MUSCLE DISEASE.ALONG WITH THERAPY I AM DOING A LOT BETTER. THE DRUG MAKES ME ANXIOUS AND I EASILY GET DISTRACTED FROM WHAT I AM DOING. IT MADE ME CRY A LOT AND I FELT AS IF I WORE MY FEELINGS ON MY SLEEVE. SONGS AND SENTENCES PLAY OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD.

I AM DEALING WITH THE MENTAL PART OKAY AND I AMQUITE PLEASE IWHT THE OVERALL REACTION IT IS HAVING WITH MY DISEASE.MY NEUROLOGIST DOES NOT WANT ME ON LONG TERM PREDNISONE SO THEY ARE WEANING ME OFF OF IT VERY SLOWLY AND WILL TRY A NEW DRUG AT SOME POINT.,4
Grave's Eye Disease,4

"Was on 40mg of prednisone 6x/day for a week, then 5x/day for a week, and so on - tapering off the drug. While on it, I was incredibly manic: sweating, heart palpitations, insomnia, racing thoughts, irresponsible spending, etc. Now that I'm off of it, I have symptoms of adrenal fatigue. The withdrawal is almost as bad as the side effects you have on it. It cleared up my Bell's Palsy, but at what cost?",5
I have been on 10-20 mg daily for over a year to control Polymyalgia Rhunatica. It gave me my life back with full movement,5
This drug has helped relieve my symptoms tremendously. Especially after living with symptoms for more than 15 months. It is a relief.,5
"side effects harder to deal with, then illness it was treating",3
"Take 3 -5 day (1000 mg) treatments when I have a flare MS up, insomnia, muscle soreness/tenderness, flushing, heartburn and water blisters seem to be my biggest issue BUT overall the outcome is most beneficial and I any extremely thankful for the benefits of this drug ",5
"Cannot sleep I go days with out sleeping on this drug, also known to cause bone deterioration.  Bone density test should be done if taking over prolonged period of time.",4
"I was on this drug, 40 mg, for 8 months, got down to 10 mg after 2 years then had surgery. Drug decreased my libido over time and ultimately shut it down, pretty much entirely. I was repeatedly assured that it would all come back when I went off drug. Not the case. Changed some hormonal balance permanently. It has been years (I am taking no meds) and no doc has been able to help. Yes, I know it was the steroid. ",5
etchy...seems to work well especially when need at a moment notice....,3
"swelling in hands face and feetit hurts, weight gain, pressure in my head over excitment cant stand or sit still need to talk very hyper",1
THIS MEDICATION IS THE BEST THINK I HAVE EVER TAKEN.  IT GIVES ME RELIEF FROM PAIN & I CAN WALK WHILE TAKING PREDNISONE.  IS ALWAYS THE BEST 10 DAYS OF MY YEAR.  ,5
"Trouble with insomnia, racing heart, mood swings, etc. Decreased the swelling and some of the pain but not all. I am also on Enbrel so I was really hoping for remission",3
LIFE SAVING!!! END OF STORY..,5
I worry as to how long I can take this medication.,5
"Inflamed sciatic nerve.  Pain down leg.  This morning, I had blood in my urine.  I came to this website for research.  I'm not satisfied at this point as there has been no indication of any information regarding blood in the urine on this site...yet.  I'm still looking!",5
So far this medication has really helped me with my muscle and bone pain. No side effects that I can determine yet. Low dose of 10MG. Second round of taking it.,5
i am talking this to help with a bacterial infection it seems to make me numb but i am also taking levofloxin and that has sideeffects too but i just started taking these and my cough is gone and i feel better i notice a change in my heart rate but i had to fever the nurse told me it happens when you are using these two drugs i hope this helps someone,4
i feel everything go numd is is because it working,3

"Was given this after my last chemo treatment - at the same time I was given Neupogen and felt like someone had driven a spike into my hip, where a small 'hotspot' had shown up.  NEVER AGAIN!  I severely doubt they should both be given together and, knowing that my chemo doc already screwed up, I don't have much confidence.  (Stopped treatment for 6 weeks!  No real reason, just 'counts are down', then did next to nothing to bring up the white cell count, which was the problem.  Now cancer has a foothold again.  Nice.)  Not a bit happy about how the Procrit literally dropped me to my knees for almost an entire week and will not allow the doctor to use it on me again.  ",1
"My mother, 84, gets shots 1x per week.  It has helped some, but she experiences itching all over her body and scalp. Not sure if this is from the Procrit.",3
"I was diagnosed with MDS nearly 4 years ago after two bone marrow biopsies. Have been taking Procrit for 1 1/2 years starting at 10,000 units per week but now on 40,000 because as the bone marrow continues to fail, Procrit has to be increased. It keeps my hemoglobin levels between 9-10 so quality of life is good. I have experienced no side effects so am satisfied; just wish dosage amounts would last longer in keeping hemoglobin levels up but have to realize it's not the Procrit that's failing, it's my bone marrow.",4
"On Procrit 4 yrs now at level 60,000 to help boost up red blood cells due to having AML Leukemia 6 yrs ago and to get rid of excess iron overload / hemochromatosis diagnosed last year. Phlebotomies of 500 ml performed when hemoglobin is over 10.8 to 11.8. Fluids given after blood removal.  Also helps with kidney disease. No side effects felt. In fact I feel better once shot is given. Fatigue and weakness goes away within 2/3 days. Plus I breath better.  ",4
"I have been getting 60,000 units of procrit every week for over a year.  My DR. now wants me to get 40,000 2 times a week because my red blood cell count will not come up above a 9. He also wants to do a second bone marrow biopsy.  I do not want to go through that again.  I need help. I have anemia",3
My father was 59 years old and was being treated for lung cancer with both chemo and radiation.   He was doing well with both but was very tired and no energy.  He had three procrit injections and died from a pulmunary embolism.   They never told us that cancer patients tend to clot and not bleed or that procrit could cause a bloodclot,1
"I have anemia - cause unknown.  Didn't notice the positive effect of Procit until I stopped after 5 weeks.  Now I don't know whether to continue or not.  Hemoglobin up 1/2 to 1 point,barely 10 instead of 14.",3
"After the first 3 mo. of injections there was improvement in my hemotocrit count.  I was able to skip injections for 2 months, began getting injections again 2 mo. ago.  Doesn't seem to be working.  Extremely tired and Frequent Severe Headaches.  What will happen if I quit getting injections?  Can anyone answer that question?",3
"My hand swole up after blood test, dark splotches all over my body. I wonder if my Doctor will take me off this drug I've only been taking it two weeks. I'm 83.",1
"Just started procrit, 20 unit injection.",4
"Treating anemia associated with MDS.  Began during chemo, and have continued for one year.  Procrit & Aranesp (after chemo) restored life-saving levels of Hemoglobin & RBC.  Provided more energy & comfortable breathing.  Initial side effects (confusion, memory issues) have subsided.  Researched any alternatives but these two treatments seem to be the only options to boost blood levels and minimize transfusions....please post if you've discovered other proven treatments...",4
"Took 13 years ago during chemo for breast cancer, was in the clinical trials for it.  I was 42 at the time and it did help my chemo go much easier.  However, now I have congestive heart failure which is probably a result of either or both the procrit and adriamycin that I took.",5
Treatment worked well. HGB 11.8 was below 7,5
"Am 85. Have been taking Procrit for 3 months after bone marrow biopsy was negative for ca. Chronic anemia, fatigue. Cause unknown! ""Age related."" Take 40K mg weekly with low blood test results. Helps. Hemogl remains low (8.2-9.1).  Can't get straight answer. Depressing.",3

"I take 40,000 units every 3 / 4 weeks for my anemia for the past 3 yrs.  The side effect I get is bad headaches which lasts about 2/3 days.  The level of my hemoglobin stays between 9.6 to 10.  I need to continue taking this medication to help stimulate my red blood cells as my bone marrow does not produce enough oxygen. ",3
Anemia due to MDS which required frequent tranfusions-am having confusion side effects and I worry about getting worse. Sometimes I talk about things that have nothing to do with reality or what's going on around me! If this continues I will have to stop taking Procrit!,4
Raised Hemo count but has caused confusion and talking about things not making sense. Hope that side effect goes away soon or I will stop taking procrit.,4
all I can say is satisfied for now,4

"My husband is due to have a hip replaced on 4-2-10 He was to have 4 injections of Procrit. The last one to be given on the day of the surgery. The next morning after the shot I had to have an ambulance take him to the ER. There at the Hospital his temp. went up to 102.8 very bad headache, vomiting. The scariest symptom was seen that morning he was very confused,not making any sense at all. They kept him over night he didn't realize where he was until 4:10 in the morning. He has no memory of what happened to him at all. He doesn't remember the spinal,the xrays,and scat scan they did. They determined he had an alergic reaction to the shot. To this day almost 2 weeks after the shot he still is not feeling well. He feels very weak and drained. He is not having the surgery. I am trying to convince him to see his primary dr.",1

It will be fine for a month and the next time I go, it's suddenly 10.  I feel absolutely no different after the shots and they've been giving me hefty doses. After being delayed for 2 hrs. in the office today, my BP was so high, they wouldn't give it to me.  The crit level was 11.9.  I told them I'd be back in two weeks, not one.  I really am getting disgusted as it doesn't seem to be making any change in the way I feel--tired all the time.  But if you stop taking it, what happens then?",3

"As friend of a patient taking procrit who is brain dead I wished the doctors would have tried other choices of treatment before giving my friend this medication, as though there was no other choices.    I don't know if she was given this medication because the doctors did't know what else to do for her anemia.  She suffered shortness of breath before taking this medicine.  So how would you know if the medicine made this problelm worse?  She was treated by Kaiser Bellflower.  This was the first thing they used to treat her anemia. ",1

"My dad was given high procrit doses for MDS from a quack doctor in Youngstown, Ohio Cancer Center. He suddenly developed rapid growing lung and liver tumors.  Three days after his death we read the FDA article that says it can cause tumor growth. My dad might be alive if he didn't take this drug. He also had circulation problems in his foot and almost lost it, probably from this. DON'T USE PROCRIT!",1
"This medication has worked well for me, I need it due to Kidney transplant, old kidneys were removed, Doctor doesn't give it unless blood count is 10 or below    ",5
Diagnosed with MDS. This is first treatment step. It has performed as expected however my condition dictates that levels will fall. The next step is Chemo and perhaps procrit. To be determined as time progresses.,4
high creatine kidney failure,2
"Presently on Pegasys and Ribavirin for Hep C. Treatment caused severe anemia.  Was put on 40,000 units injections weekly.  While my anemia is still present, it is stablized and not getting worse.  I only hope the recent FDA concerns for Procrit don't hit me later in life.  Unfortunately with medications, while it may help with one symptom/disease it may also be causing long term effects.  One can only decide if the good outweighs the potential bad.  Had I known of these concerns I would not have started with this drug.",4
"Procrit is being used to treat my condition of sickle cell amemia. My physician hopes to reduce the amount of frequent crises attacks sometimes leading to hospitalization. The 40,000 units that I am on has resulted in a stable HgB level but still on the low side of the normal range (6.5 g/dl). Often times I feel more lethargic than energetic within a 24-48 hr  period of receiving injection. Sometimes a hunger headaches developes or minor sickling attacks. Overall the good outweighs the bad a the present time.",3
This drug saved my life! While it wasn't an easy program to go through the end result made it worth it. I would like to hear from others about any long term side affects and length of time it took to feel fully recovered.  ,5
The worst experience of my life. I have had every side effect possible. I was only able to do 1 week. I had eight weeks of intensive itching that my dermatlogist was able to help by putting me in a light treatment booth. Would never recommend using.,1
"I have had 2 shots of this poisonous drug. 1st shot in March 2018. Didn't realize that some of the effects were caused by the shot, and were not that serious.  Sept 2018, 2nd shot.  I have had almost every side effect, joint pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen face, ankles, rash...you name it.  I will never take this drug again.  Mild osteo after chemo for breast cancer, so I don't believe that it was even necessary.  I'm 4 months past the 2nd shot, and I'm at least getting some of my energy back.  This med may help some people, but the reviews show that they are the minority...too many side effects. ",1
"Love this medication! With in 24 hours, I have great relief in all my joints. This is my second shot and am quite pleased with it. At the end of my first six months I was begging for the next dose. I was having carpal tunnel problems in both wrist, knee tightness and back muscle spasms at my T8 compression site. I had to wait an additional 2 month for my shot due to insurance changes at age 65. Got my shot yesterday and I already feel like a new woman!",5
I have been on prolia for five years. No side effects that I have noticed. Bone density went from high risk of fracture to low risk. ,5
"This drug caused insomnia and bone pain for me. Doctor insist my symptoms were not caused by Prolia. After my 3rd injection I developed severe sciatica, then severe bone pain that moved to many different parts of my body. I developed a large boney lump on my shoulder that was extremely painful. Feet and knees got so bad I couldn’t walk. I was virtually bed ridden for 3 months. Felt 90 years old. Never again.  I refused my last shot that was due two months ago and I’m much better. This stuff literally poisoned me. Big mistake to allow this potent poison into your body",1
I experienced severe diarrhea about a week after my first injection. It lasted on a daily basis for 6 months and one week and them disappeared.  I had several other tests to determine other possible  causes.  They were all negative.,1
"This medicine should be called Prolia Poison. Side effects began with numbness/tingling in left arm and hand. Then dizziness and major spasms in the buttocks (gluteus) and pain and numbness down legs. This started in Jan, 2018 and has continued until now (Nov 27/18). The spasms and pain have been debilitating. Hopefully things will improve by Feb which will be 6 months since last injection. We were supposed to travel to Az this winter but we are reluctant to do that now. This poison has caused much turmoil in our lives. Will not take anymore injections and advise anyone reading this not to take these injections.",1
"This has been a horrible drug for me. I have suffered most all of the terrible side effect. Muscle and joint pain, very severe at times. I went from an active person before Prolia, now I stuggle to find strength to go each day. It is poison and should be taken off the market! ",1
"IMPORTANT: I was told by BCBS that this drug would be covered, but after receiving an $1,100 bill, I found out that Prolia's manufacturer would reimburse me up to $1800 per year, but ONLY if I signed away all of my personal medical history for the next 5 years to the company, which is a ridiculous invasion of privacy. I have had no bad side effects from the drug itself. It's better than Reclast, which made me fell like I had the flu, but I also haven't seen significant increase in bone density. We do need to protect our personal data and not allow pharma companies to bribe us into sharing all our data. Call their hotline and listen to their pitch. See how they try to trick you into ""pressing one to agree to all terms."" It's unreal. ",4
I have received two doses of Prolia.  Had a bone density scan last week.  Doctor said my bones have responded well to the injections.  I have had no side effects.  The only downside for me is that I will have to be on Prolia continually due to risk of spine fracture if I stop.,5
"I had three injections of Prolia and have suffered for over a year with severe jaw pain and loss of one tooth as a result of those injections.  After I had a tooth pulled, I also fought a bacterial infection for over a year.  Three dentists told me that there is a component in Prolia that attracted bacteria to the exposed bone from the extraction.  They further told me that Prolia can stay in the system for several years.  I am now going to lose one more tooth because of bone loss that is attributable to Prolia.  This medicine should not be manufactured, and I am surprised that there has not been a class action suit against the pharmaceutical company because of its terrible and costly side effects.",1
"I had my first injection 4 weeks ago and had I read the many reviews of Prolia, I would have not taken the drug, despite my M.D.s urging that it is a good,effective med.  I was not exactly feeling terrific a month ago, but since the shot, my entire body seems to be failing. I have constant mild to severe nausea; pains in my legs, hips, hands and spine that I've never had in my life. My skin is in constant pain/outbreak of hives and itching so bad on my entire body that it blistered in areas and peeled due to excessive scratching. Now a UTI has begun.  I had read the entire  insert material and was aware that side effects might occur but the side effects are increasing as time goes on and the fact that there is no way to purge oneself of the medication   is frightening. I feel very sick and apparently helpless.  I regret having taken this product ..even though the doctors all suggest it's ""the best medication going"" and they know of its side effects but of all their patients on the drug...know of no one who  has experienced any problem.  REALLY? ",1
This poison has completely destroyed my life. I went from living a active life to not being able to move. I am always in terrible pain and stay sick all the time.,1
"I got my first shot in May of 2018. In June I started to get pains in my bones, joints, jaw, feeling nausea. By August I went from a very active person to not active at all. I have so much pain I can't even walk around the block. I will not be getting another Prolia shot. I will take my chances with getting a fracture. I would like to know how long this drug stays in our system. The doctor who gave me the shot does NOT call me back after many phone calls I have sent her. This drug should be taken off the market. ",1
I suffered an atypical femur fracture from taking Prolia. Now I find out the drug co. has stated you may get vertebrae fractures if you go off it and don't start treatment again. Why is this drug on the market?The drug helped build bone but the possible side effects outweigh the advantages in my case.,2
"I reviewed this drug about 5 months after 1st injection - could not attribute what was happening to the Prolia, but was suspicious.  I felt as though I had aged several years, was badly fatigued, very weak and had episodes of perspiring at odd times for no apparent reason. At the time, I wouldn't have called them hot flashes; I'm 74. About 2 weeks before 2nd injection was due, I realized I was beginning to feel 'human' again.  This continued for about 2-3 weeks after injection #2, then the insidious downward spiral began again - weakness, fatigue.  This time, I realized the hot flashes had to be a result of the Prolia, complete with malodorous perspiration.  Dr. stated I would not get another test to determine benefit of this drug until I had been on it for TWO YEARS.  If I wanted to stop, she said I would need to take EVISTA, side effects = blood clots,danger of a stroke and.....hot flashes among other things.  Good grief.  If I stop the Prolia, I will be considered 'non-compliant'and there is absolutely no way I can endure hot flashes 5 months out of every 6.    One menopause experience was enough.  Feel coerced at this point.  The other side effect I am now SURE is due to this drug is chronic constipation, because function returned to my normal shortly before and after injection #2.  I am giving up my quality of life in order to spare myself another fracture.  It's a rock/hard place situation.  The cost to me is over $400/year. No matter WHAT I take, my quality of life suffers.  What a dilemma. Presently 3 months post second injection. Fatigue and weakness, not surprisingly, lead to mild depression.  It's like dominoes.",1
I am glad to have read all reviews  I will not take this meds  I definitely agree it should be taken off the market. it's horrible what it does to people. shame on you. ,1
I have recently had my 7th Prolia shot. Thank God I have not had ANY adverse effects and it is helping to re-build my bones. My last bone density scan said I went back 10 years due to the success of this drug.,5
"Surgeon required me to have injection before he'd perform surgery. Expected to have 1 more. Flu like symptoms then severe pain in jaw, shoulder, wrist, fingers, hip ",1
WARNING-WARNING- I WAS HEALTHY AND HAPPY...THEN  SHOT # 1 NOT TOO HORRIBLE ...THEN #2 SHOULD HAVE WARNED ME  DUMMY ME ...............GOT SHOT#3 .AND NOW I LAY ON THE OUCH WITH A HEATING PAD ALL OVER MY BODY BUT MAINLY ON MY GUT IT CAUSED ME COLITIS!! I HAVE  NO LIFE.. CANT BREATHE RASHES PIN IN JAW ARMS LEGS WAS IN THE ER SEVERAL TIMES!!! THIS RX IS DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!,1
"I have read and experienced almost all of the symptoms that other people have reported. Sciatica, pain in back of thighs, tired, muscle pain, flu like symptoms, many more. Had chronic pain before. Never occurred to me to reseabefore getting this shot. Had Reclast before. No side effects. If only Iâ??d known! DO not get this shot! Quality of life severely affected",1
Prolia shot3/5/18 Dr. Shah Anderson and Patel  Side effects began sometime in April-May and continues today.  Arthritis pain had been managed with aspirin but increased in my hand joints to being more constant.  Using pressure on my thumbs became more painful.  The pain went into my wrist joint and right hip joint.  I started having random shooting pains in my thumbs.  I was increasingly tired even after a good night’s sleep. Depression and headaches followed.,1
Be using Prolia for 3 years.  Last bone density scan showed improvement. I have not experience any side effects.,5
"3RD SHOT AND THAT WILL BE MY LAST-I THOUGHT I AHD IBS NO MY RA GOT MUCH WORSE AND I HAVE ABDOMEN PAIN AND CONSTIPATION AND SEVRE LEG AND ARM PAIN AND WEAKNESS AND  I JUST WANT MY OLD LIFE BACK! THIS DRUG ""PROLIA"" MADE ME WORSE!!!",1
"Rating given only to access the chance to comment here on this site. This drug has been recommended for me, or Reclast. I'm so disturbed by the reviews and the repetition sited of physical reactions, I cannot imagine taking the risk. So sorry for all those who are suffering in these ways. My gratitude for your posts which have probably helped many others.",1
"Today was my 9th prolia shot, I'm doing great,Ireversed osteoporosis  by going to the gym 4 days a week, having a personal trainer doing TRX I eat very healthy organic protein foods, and taking excellent organic vitamins with stronium, I'm 55,feel like I'm 40,  I feel awesome, today was my last shot. My spine is normal,  right hip normal, left hip low end osteopenia. Stay positive and active, it's all in the mindset. Prolia is an excellent drug I'm so pleased with the results... ",5
"I gave all one stars because of the side effects. I've only had one injection, Apr 4, 2018, and on Apr 25, 2018, all of a sudden I began to have difficulty breathing. Anytime I'm up and moving around, I pant and my oxygen levels are on 80-85. I've been to my reg doctor and she gave me a breathing treatment which did not help at all, a shot of steroids, and a Z pack, none of which seemed to help. I've learned to get up slowly and to walk slowly and to take deep breaths as I do so.  I do not plan to get another injection of this stuff.  From the reviews I've read, it doesn't seem to help that much to put up with the side effects which also seems to include general weakness.  I'm the sole caregiver for my 95 yr old bedridden mother, so this has practically stopped me in my tracks!",1
I have had two injections so far I am having a hard time with pain in right hip and pain in both legs at times. Some what more problems with allergies and breathing. Feel very bloated. Overall my joints are hurting me quite a bit. ,1
"No obvious side effects immediately following 11-01-18 first injection.  Didn't notice anything at all.  Approximately 3 weeks after the injection, I noted some overall weakness and slight difficulty with my gait.  General malaise progressed over the winter and my strength and stamina have decreased markedly.  I do NOT know whether this was due to the Prolia or is simply a decline in my health due to aging and a really cold winter. I feel as though I've aged several years in one season! I am suspicious enough to have reported this to both the FDA and to AMGEN.  Saw PCP today for check up and she noted marked changes and suggested home physical therapy. Kind of shocking to my very independent self...not to mention scary. I have had no obvious side effects as others report. Dental check up was fine, no jaw pain, nothing obvious....just this insidious decline in overall ability to perform activities of daily living over past 5 months. I am somewhat hesitant to get a second injection. You have to take a leap of faith, I think, as positive results don't become apparent early on.  My gut is telling me to err on the side of caution....but am truly ""on the fence"" over this one.",3
"Great for people that can not take Fosamax, because of stomach issues.",4
"Just reviewed side effects as I just put together that the severe pain in my upper left arm and shoulder my be caused by the prolia. Also have experienced lip tingling, and constipation.",3
"I have had 8 Prolia shots and have had no side effects.  I just received the results of my third dexascan.  I started with a T score of -3.0 in my spine.  I am now at -1.7.  My femur started at -1.8 and is now -1.0.  Needless to say I am thrilled with the results and I have had no side effects.  I am sorry that so many folks have experienced difficulties, but this drug has been very effective for me.",5
After. My. Fourth. Shot. Of. Prolia. I. Ache. All over. My back. Legs. LeftThigh. Ankles. Wrists. Neck. And. Fatigue now I am scared. Of more problems if i go. Off the. Med.   ,1
"About 3 weeks after my first injection of Prolia, I started experiencing back pain. I have always been a fairly active person. I eat organic foods and don't smoke or drink. Dealing with drug has resulted in it being a major feat just to cross the room. Back and hip pain, stiffening of hands, trouble with digestion, unable to sleep, in short many of the same things others have described. I've called Amgen, made a report to the FDA and let my doctor know. I have 4 more months to fight the results of this injection, and rest assured there will never be another. This drug needs to come with gigantic warning labels or taken off the market all together. ",1
"I am into my third month after first injection of Prolia. I have severe back pain, swollen joints in my fingers, continual bad headache/migraine. I have had one tooth filling fall out. My body gets so hot, I feel like I'm burning up. I also feel like of have the flu all the time. I feel tired all the time and depressed. I'm not going to have the next injection due in March.",1
After the third injection I have accelerated bone growth in mouth. My dentist is not sure if the Prolia caused this or not. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this.,3
"Flare up of autoimmune conditions, body on fire, hand and feet pain, jaw pain  2 neurotic teeth, COPD event, walking difficult. I had these symptoms appear within 3 months of the 6 month injection. I never had these multiple problems in such a cluster. It took about 9 months to recover.",1
"A further update on my use of this medication.   My T score has improved again and I now have -1.5 and -1.2 scores which I am really pleased about. So, no osteoporosis only osteopenia. I have had 4 injections now and had already decided I wanted to come off this medication before I received my results. Recently I have been suffering back lower back ache and other unexplained aches and pains which are intermittent.  I do not know if this is attributed to the Prolia and unless I have a period free of it I will never know.   It has certainly worked for me and I am glad I tried it.It now remains to be seen what happens with my T scores in a year's time after only take calcium tablets and excercise. Watch this space!",5
I take monthly Prolia injections to help remodel bones under continual attack from extensive bone metastases. Minor flu like systems for day or two following injection. It has been very effective in strengthening my bones and therefore reducing pain.,5
"I have had approximately 5 injections.  I have experienced everything from severe hip pain, groin pain, numbness in feet and hands, feeling of spinning, etc. had MRI, CAT scans, ultrasounds, blood work for my symptoms until I researched my medical history and discovered all my symptoms were related to the shot. Due this December for another shot and that WILL NOT HAPPEN.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE DRUG.",2
"The side effects are terrible, I hate taking this but its working so my doctors says stay on it.",3
"Look at Mayo Clinic research on Denosaub. I had many side effects they list. Amgen did not include the same side effects for Prolia (active ingredient Denosaub). I had chest discomfort after a few weeks (we dismissed it to allergies), on the 31st day had lumps mimicking breast cancer, several rounds of biopsies, after that abscesses, dimpled skin, and more. I could feel it in my system with sweats and other changes. At around 5-months I could feel the lumps shrinking and going away. After 6-months with the exception of permanent scars, the problems have ceased. What a seriously traumatic event! I have filed FDA and Amgen reports. No one has done anything to assist. There is no data on the people who dropped out of the study after one shot. There is also no litigation pending which I would expect is the ONLY way to get vendor attention. If this happened to you or someone you know, have them file with FDA. That's the only way the next updated insert will include warnings for cancer mimicking breast issues.",1
"Hi,- I had my 5th injection today and still am free from adverse reactions - thank God! I also received news from my recent bone density scan that it has helped my bones become much stronger - taking me back 10 years! I did not do well on other drugs so I am thankful this one is working for me. ",5
"I am a fit 63 year old male who was surprised to learn he had low bone density. I took 4 injections of Prolia without side effects from 2014 to 2016 on recommendation of an endocrinologist. My bone density appeared to have improved slightly. I had a follow up appointment with my endocrinologist in May 2017 and he was quite concerned, having recently read reports of spontaneous spinal fractures and rapid reversal of bone density gains after ceasing to use Prolia. So we finally discussed where my Prolia use was going long term and he was vague - 10 years  of Prolia and then transition to bisphosphonates. Ten years on a drug that hadn't been tested that long! I realized I was a guinea pig taking a drug with an alarming and growing list of side effects for uncertain benefit (after all, people have fractured femurs as a result of taking this drug - one of the strongest bones in the body). Time to abandon this train before it ran off the rails or crashed. I will take no more Prolia. Before you take Prolia have a careful chat to your physician about your long term plans - once on this drug, you can't stop without rapid reversal of bone density gain - you become a slave to it - so you may want consider whether there is any point in starting?",3
"I had my first injection in January.  No side effects for a while.  I have had a lot of pain between my shoulder blades and back.  I had to go to ER last w/e due to chest pains.  Not sure if it is related, will have stress test this week.  Have noticed a difference in my teeth, going to the dentist soon to see if there is a change in strength and spacing.  After reading reviews, not sure if I want to take the next shot, which is due  in June.",2
"At the age of 62, I discovered I had severe osteoporosis in the spine, and after trying oral bisphosphonates (terrible reaction!) requested denusomab. Three injections in, and helped by supplementary calcium and vitamin D, my bone density has improved by 5%. I am cautiously delighted. No noticeable side effects so far. My specialist says by age 70 at this rate my bone density will be better than that of most of my peers. ",5
"About a week after first injection, developed severe neuropathy in both feet.  My doctor said that it couldn't have been from the drug.  Many specialists later, a vascular specialist said that the drug possibly caused my lymphedema.  It has ruined my life.  Will never get another injection.  I'd rather break a bone!",3
"I want to thank everyone here that rated this drug. I was almost convinced by my doctor to take this drug, but after reading all these side affects, I will NOT be trying this. I have determined that the risk is not worth the maybe help from this drug. I pray that these women get well after stopping the treatment.",1
"5th injection, no side effects,now normal bone in hips,-1.5 in hips",5
"This is the worse medication my husband has ever taken. It should be taken off the market. He was in pain before but now it is 10 fold. He got his first shot back in July 2016 due for another one in Jan.2017. That is not happening. his bones hurt and he says his muscles feel like they are being pulled from the bone. Arms, legs, shoulders, neck all hurt from getting the prolia shot...  ",1
"Call FDA to report negative side effects 1 888-463-6332.  Especially if you are having stomach issues. Be sure to report if the doctor reviewed your possible side effects or did they say ""No side effects"".  Tell the FDA about your doctors reaction to your reports of Prolia side effects. Did they say this couldn't be prolia? The more we report the more likely they will review this drug.  See Ask a patient   anyone on prolia   Topix any one on prolia. You are not alone.  ",1
"This month I have received my 4th injection of Prolia for having Osteoporosis. I am thankful I have had ZERO side effects! (I have previously tried  biphosphonate drugs, they  gave me terrible side effects.) I will get my bone density next June to see the results and will write a review at that time. While I am sorry for those women who have problems related to Prolia, my doctor has told me  he treats over a 100 patients and not one person has had a serious side effect. ",5
"This drug has ruined my mother's daily life. Prior to getting this shot she was an active and fairly healthy 75 year old women.  She is miserable now, having developed skin lesions all over her body that constantly itch like crazy! She has tried everything that her doctor has told her to do. She saw a dermatologist who told her to take a bleach bath, has had steroid cream among other creams and pills to ""help"",  all of which have done nothing for this problem that arose after having this shot.  She is miserable and has lost interest in daily activities. Please read the reviews and consider the side effects even if they are rare or unlikely side effects. My mom is just waiting out the time period now for this to get out of her body so that she can be herself again.",1
"Don't take this medication if you live alone.  Thank God I have a supportive husband at my side since the side effects of Prolia started kicking in 10 days after the second injection.  (By the way, the physician who talked me into taking it has quit the practice and gone into concierge medicine.)  I've gone from being a healthy 67-year-old to a partial cripple in the last 3-1/2 months.  Almost every day there's a new place that hurts.  I have widespread bone, joint and muscle pain.  Getting in and out of a car is difficult.  Yesterday, my husband had to drive me to a doctor's appointment because my knees were too stiff to work the pedals.  Having very few button-down-the front blouses is a wardrobe negative;  pulling a shirt or nightgown over my head is agony. Reaching a high shelf in the kitchen is impossible, nor can I lift a turkey for Thanksgiving.  I'm starting to use handicapped stalls in public restrooms.  All that being said, I'm still able to fast-walk five laps at the mall in the afternoons, although it hurts.  Riding in a car more than a few minutes makes me really stiff.  My collar bones hurt so much that they were x-rayed.  No bone cancer,ELMH thank God.  Next month I get to see a rheumatologist.  By the way, acupuncture didn't work for me. ",1
"I had a Prolia injection in Feb 2016. About 8 weeks following the injection I started to experience severe UTI, bladder and systemic infections. After many rounds of antibiotics that were ineffective I ended up on mega doses of CIPPRO (1,000 mg a day for 7 days). I will never touch Prolia again. I was not adequately warned of the possible side effects. I reported my experience to Amgen, the manufacturer, and to the FDA. ",1
"Further update. It is now a year since my first Prolia injection. I will be having my third injection because my bone density score has gone from -2.7 last year to -2.1 now which means I no longer have osteoporosis, it has been reduced to osteopenia.  Yes I do get aches and pains but I really cannot say that is due to the Prolia, more like general aging of my joints.  I am happy with the results. My gynecologist has said it won't improve further only stablise the condition which is still a bonus.",4
"This medication has ruined my life. Pain everywhere. Took shot one month ago, life has been one day after another filled with severe pain. New pain last night in hip and back area, difficulty walking. My doctor did not explain side effect possible-info after the shot. I will never take this shot again. Maker of this medication should be held accountable and doctors who prescribe this should be more informed. My doctor said ""I have never had anyone to have this reaction"". My answer was ""You have now"". What can be done to stop this pain and other problems? ",1
"Two days after receiving shot of prolia, I began to have serious joint and muscle pain. Now, 5 weeks later, the pain all over my body is so severe, I have difficulty walking and functioning at any level. I will not take this shot again.",1
"I thought I was going crazy...but reading these reviews have eased my mind.  Two weeks after my injection EVERY BONE AND JOINT in my body is extremely PAINFUL.  This is my third shot, first one was not so bad, 6 months later for second shot, the severe pain started.  I put the third round for an extra few months because I didn't want to ruin my summer.  Now, after the 3rd dose I can barely move and get through the day.  I cant exercise or get to the gym, just getting out of bed and getting through my day as a teacher is almost impossible.  I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER DOSE OF THIS AGAIN.  It has also done NOTHING, minimal  change in my bone density testing, so IMO do not  do it. ",1
"First shot I got diarrhea about ten days later -did not connect it to the Prolia.  Next shot I got even worse diarrhea that lasted longer.  My GP said to take Align probiotic (and as many others as I wanted).  That helped and I have stayed on the probiotics since.  Had fourth shot six weeks ago.  I have the worst diarrhea ever, fatigue, pain in just about every bone ",1
"I haven taken Prolia every 6 months for 4 years.  I have minor pain in small joints of hands and feet.  Overall, my experience has been positive.  My osteopenia has not progressed.",4
"Received Prolia in March 2016 and felt fine for 3 wks. Started with numbness and tingling in face, hands and fingers. Started on one side of body and thought I was having a TIA. Then it became bilateral and did not last long-was just annoying. The numbness and tingling progressed to severe pain in right thumb which lead to severe pain, numbness, tingling, burning, cramping in right hand. Had an EMG and had mod-severe carpel tunnel. NEVER had any issue with carpel tunnel prior to injection. Had to have surgery for carpel tunnel. Now have developed carpel tunnel in left hand. Am waiting to see if symptoms subside after 6 mos from injection. I have also suffered with severe pain in every joint in my body. Take Motrin every day just to get by. Doctors are not convinced that it is Prolia related! Really??? I am very active and have hard time walking, getting out and into the car. Work full time as a nurse and feel like I am dying some days. Please use caution with this drug. I counted the months until the drug effects subside. Now at the 6 month mark and there is no let up! I just want my life back prior to Prolia!!!!",1
"I have been having leg and foot cramps 4-5 nights a week since my 2nd injection in July. Will get dexascan around December to see if drug is effective.  I have ostopenia in my lower back,but feel pretty good.  I am overweight, but maintain a good workout/aerobic regime.  These reviews, though, are scary.",3
"First shot one month ago, few weeks developed severe hives, rash on arms, back, scalp on Prednisone and injection.  Now experiencing back pain and extremity pain, ear pain,tired. As a nurse did research and was apprehensive, talked to Dr. And he felt shot was worth it, I will never get another!",1
"I have had two prolia shots over the last 7 months.  There were no side effects from the first shot; however, the second shot approximately 4 weeks ago has caused tremendous muscle pain and soreness in my arms, legs and lower back.  I am wondering if this pain is permanent or will it fade with time.  If it doesn't fade, I will not be taking any more shots. ",1
48 hours after 1st injection developed Herpes infection which I have NOT HAD FOR 20 years! Too much of a coincidence for it not to be caused by the Prolia.  NEVER AGAIN!,1
"I was diagnosed with Polymyalgin Rheumatica (PMR) because I am allergic to the antibody in Prolia. PMR is a very painful auto-immune disease.  I cannot have any drug ending in ""umab.""  This happened after the first shot.",1
nail in my coffin my boarding pass to heaven (premature),1
"I am a 1 year patient. Have experienced severe back pain, teeth chipping and overall feeling of deterioration. Will not continue, warn everyone, and hope it gets out of my system soon!",2
Had my 2nd injection of Prolia a month ago now. Usual aches and pains when I get up in the morning which I associate with my age (61).  I certainly don't think I could blame it on the drug.  Still yet to have another bone density scan (not due until November) so not sure what the effect has been yet. I am thinking positive and will report further when I have had the scan.,3
"Stiffness, all over a feeling of tightness in my head, back, abdomen and other extremities. trouble sleeping. All related to a shot of Prolia I received in April. I have MS and I do think it has exacerbated all my problems   ",1
"I was prescribed Prolia by my Medical Oncologist one year ago, after DEXA scans showed significant loss of bone density following chemotherapy for breast cancer in 2011. After my first injection, I had no side effects for the first 2 - 3 months. At that time, I began noticing pains in both legs, muscle cramping in feet, toes, fingers, etc. I had read the potential side effects profile prior to receiving Prolia, but as a retired Nurse, I realize that all medications can have adverse effects, but not all patients experience them. I thought nothing more of it. After my 2nd Prolia injection in December 2015, I began experiencing a myriad of symptoms (starting 2 months later), such as severe bone pain in thighs, shins, and arms. Increased joint pain in hips, lower back pain, fatigue, irritability, increased frequency of GERD symptoms, loose stools...the list is extensive. I recently saw my Oncologist, who is ordering a PET scan to rule out metastatic breast cancer, but after reading many blogs and comments about other patients' side effects, I am convinced that my symptoms are related to Prolia. I will have the PET scan done, but truly believe this is Prolia Adverse Events I am undergoing. My main question is...how long does this last?? My left leg pain has gotten so bad that I am now limping, struggling to get out of a chair, or from a sitting position, and experiencing throbbing pain at night that wakes me often. ",2
"Hi, I just had my 3rd injection of Prolia. So far - so good thank God. It is now the summer months and I tend to get more stiffness and neuropathy during this time from a previous cancer treatment I had. So I am not ready to say this is attributed to Prolia. I will see by my next injection how I feel and hope when I take my bone density scan next year that there is improvement. My doctor does not feel the symptoms are due to the Prolia and has over 150 patients all fine on this drug. (He even read these reviews prior to my taking this drug since I'd been so hesitant.) I hope all those with the horrid effects, do heal speedily.",5
First dose two weeks ago. The Nurse said it would be very painful but after the initial burn it was not bad. No adverse effects so far. Hope it will stay that way as I have yo take aromatase inhibitor for at least 5 years and I have osteopenia.,5
"The first day I had the injection I began to have severe back and joint pain.  I could not even move my thumbs without pain.  I had no idea this would happen or I would never have taken the injection.  Two weeks later and I am still having terrible back pain,",1
"I received Prolia injection on March16,2016.About 8 days after,I felt like I had the flu,extremely dizzy for weeks,began having back and neck pain.Back pain is so severe,I can hardly walk.It is now May 27,back pain is so severe,I am going for injections in my back on Wednesday to try and get some relief.About a week after Prolia injection,I developed a sinus infection,given antibiotics and a prednisone shot.When that cleared up,I developed a UTI,again on antibiotics. This drug has definitely suppressed my immune system. One infection after the other.I have developed eczema so severe,my hands just crack and bleed.I have no energy at all.I have nausea,heartburn constantly.Began looking back on calendar,after my Aug.21,2015 shot of Prolia,I developed jaw pain so severe,it was difficult to chew food,Two weeks later,came the back and neck pain,flu-like symptoms,dizziness,sinus infection,all the same symptoms that happened recently.I never put together what was happening to me and timing of Prolia injections.Looking back,all symptoms start about 8 days after receiving shot.I have gone back as far as last 3 injections and it is identical side effects. This is the only medication I am on,so I know there is nothing else that could be causing this.I caution anyone who is thinking of taking Prolia,think twice.This drug has literally ruined my life.I went from being very active to not being able to do anything because of the pain this drug has caused.Do not take this drug.It should be taken off the market.",1
I have only had two shots so I can't rate its effectiveness.  I have been experiencing extreme pain in my hips and less extreme in my knees.  I also have broken out in a rash on my torso. The doctor doesn't think it is Prolia because I just broke out about 45 days after my second shot. Has anyone else experienced this?,1
"I have been getting injections of Prolia for over 2 years. For 1 1/2 years I had absolutely no complaints!  I didn't have one side effect, and after 1 1/2 years my bone scan showed a tremendous improvement in bone density - a 7.8% improvement!I was thrilled! The shot was no big deal, and I never had any issues at all until my 3rd shot. Then I started experiencing horrible joint and bone pain in my shoulders, and sometimes my hips. I never suspected it could be Prolia as I had never had any problems previously. My Dr. tested me for Lyme Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and something else which escapes me at the moment. All results were negative. The pain was awful - and worse at night when trying to sleep. I couldn't even move my pillow without horrible shoulder pain. Then I had to take heavy duty steroids for a completely different issue, and the pain disappeared. When I got my next shot, within 3 weeks the pain returned. It's been 5 months since my last shot, and I'm still in pain. I take Aleve every night before I go to bed, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. I'm due for another shot in 6 weeks, and I'm torn. It has helped my Osteoporosis so much, but I don't think I can live with this pain. I just don't understand (and neither does my Dr.) why it took 1 1/2 yrs before I had these side effects. At this point, I'm not sure what to do! I can hardly get out of bed in the morning - actually I ""roll"" out of bed instead of trying to use my arms. It's just too painful!    ",5
"Horrible back, hip, arm, neck pain. Eczema. ",1
I saw my mother suffer from osteoporotic fractures.  I had my first Prolia injection two weeks ago.  No side effects.  I hope for the best.  ,4

"I hope you will post this, but for a different reason. I wanted to say how eternally grateful I am for those who did try Prolia and warned me of the terrible effects they incurred.  I was a week away from a first shot, I read the posts and I truly believe you saved my quality of life.  I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I wish things were more simple, that those of us who do need to rebuild or preserve our bones could take something without such tragedy happening post-med.  I guess some people are lucky and do benefit...but my God the risks...If I had gone ahead and gotten these symptoms, it would have devastated me to the point I don't think I could fight anymore...would have been so exhausted and disillusioned...since both doctors telling me, no problem you'll be fine...take it, you need it...those who have troubles are just needles in the haystack..I almost did it...last minute told spine doc and rheumatologist, ""I found the needles in the haystacks, like a thousand plus of them!""  Only thing I've been able to endure and gives me quality of life with RA is prednisone, and I mean like for years! Thus, bones will continue to weaken....then after a bad fall, a back compression fracture, obvious was told needed something..tried Forteo, two months and got so exhausted could not walk, shortness of breath, chest pains, ready for hospital...thought, hoped Prolia option, but no...Yet, I have quality of life...i will try Enbrel again, but Prolia, I am not taking that chance...Perhaps some will be lucky, but certainly more caution is necessary than the doctors let on...and when direct result symptoms from Prolia use are reported, patients need to be believed!!!  Wellness hugs to all..God Bless...GG",1
"Prolia was recommended for me almost entirely because of the ease of taking an injection every six months to treat osteoporosis.  My doctor never explained the risks.  I have had an irregular heart beat (within two weeks of an injection), urinary tract infection, raised cholesterol, muscle soreness in my arm, lowered immune system, and bumps and strange red patches on my face.  When brought to my doctor's attention he simply brushed it off and said, too bad, it is so convenient.  Prolia is a new drug as others have commented and long term effects are unknown.  My concern is whether or not I will recover fully from the adverse effects of Prolia.",2
"I was very sad to see people who are having bad side effects. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer I looked for all of the expert help I could find. I've been on a lot of drugs so I walked into my local Walgrens and asked the pharmacist to help me.  I've found that pharmacists know almost more about medications than doctors.  The help I received was amazing - including this information about prolia.  You need to have your blood calcium levels checked before starting and while on this drug.  This is stated plainly in the drug information.  A low blood calcium will cause some of the side effects I've seen described on this site.  Also, the drug manufacturer says that a dental exam needs to be done prior to starting prolia because you should not have any dental procedures while on the drug.  I also asked my doctor to set me up with a dietician and I've learned what foods are high in calcium.  I eat them three times a day.  One more side effect is that prolia makes it easy to become infected or sick.  I've learned to wash my hands many times during the day, avoid crowds and get a flu shot. I am not a doctor but I would urge you to find a pharmacist and get really good education on medications that your doctor just doesn't have time to complete.",4
"I'm SMZ from an earlier review and have a follow up.  Tomorrow  I will have an CT scan to check my pancreas and liver.  The pain I'm suffering from since starting the Prolia in February is worse...much worse.  Now my teeth hurt constantly.  I feel weaker every day and this is really messing up my life.  The exhausting fatigue I'm enduring everyday is becoming endurable. Prolia has pretty much ruined my life right now.  Then I get the bill.  Unreal we have to pay so much money to make ourselves sicker than we were and then are subject to ridicule or being call ""fakers"" by those who don't have problems.  Well my daughter can't use Vicoden.  I can without problems.  She passes out cold and keep s passing out.  Vicadin does that to her so please cease the comments saying we aren't ""sick"" from the Pollia when you are wonderfully having a positive experience with this drug.   All you do is rub salt in our already painful wounds and we don't need that crap.  Everyone of my complaints are true and sincere.   I will NEVER EVER take any of these types of drugs again!!! NEVER!!!!  Then to add insult to injury the bill arrives and I have to pay big bucks for torturning myself.   Let alone, the costs of my further appointments and the added medical costs I'm going to be incurring for who knows how long.  Someone said it's takes 6 months for theProlia to cleared of my system.  YUCK!!! I HATE PROLIA!!!  Thiis pain is driving me crazy!!!",1
"This drug is evil.  Major side effect for 4 of the 6 months including major fatigue, stomach issues and painful bones.  2 months after the drug should be out of my system, still not feeling as well as before the injection.  I would never use this drug again.",1
The joint pain and fatigue I experienced and continuously experience on a daily basis immediately after receiving the Prolia injection is far worse then the Arthritic and Osteo pain I had before the treatment.,1
"Been just over a month since my injection and I feel terrible.  Within a week my stomach started hurting real bad.   Pain I've never had before.   Upon awakening in the mornings my legs and arms give me unbearable pain and they hurt all day long.  I don't know how much longer I can endure this.  I am very light headed most of the time.  I wish I would just die.   I asked my doctor if the Prolia was causing this and he said probably not.  Sometimes my stomach feels like it's going to explode.  I've never had problems with heartburn, ulcers, etc.  I don't know what to do.  For the people who think those of us who are making this stuff up or that we would've developed these issues anyway just know this.  We aren't crazy!!!  We KNOW our bodies!!!!!!!!   Not everyone develops bad or the same side effects to drugs.  My doc had me on Boniva infusions prior to switching to Prolia.  I developed severe eye inflammation and had crushing pain in my legs and hips for at least a month after the infusion, which is why I quit.  Doctor told me Prolia doesn't have as many side affects.  I say the drug company is lying.   I Looked up the side affects after I've felt this horrible for a couple weeks and not the other way around so I'm not making this up after reading these reviews.     I seriously cry myself to sleep the pain is that bad and quietly wish to myself that I won't wake up.    ",1
"This caused the worst pain I've ever experienced in my entire life.  I ended up in the hospital  for over a week and due to the intense narcatic medications it took through the process, I then had to go through a horrible withdrawal process while still healing from the Prolia itself.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG. It took a year or more before I starting feeling like ,myself. This was the last treatment of this medication I will ever get. ",1
"I've had 6 injections of Prolia over the past 3 years.  I had some back pain after the last one, and I've had 3 bladder infections over the 3 years, all of which may or may not be attributable to Prolia.  Prior to getting the injections, I had four vertebrae fractures due to osteoporosis.  The pain from those fractures was unbelievably horrifying and it took me a year to get back to being relatively pain free.  The back pain one might get from using Prolia is minor in comparison, trust me.  If you have osteoporosis, make sure you're taking something to halt it, it's a very painful and disfiguring disease.",5
"I have been on it for almost a year.  My cholesterol LDL has gone up, my back hurts, my ability to walk long distances has gone way down.  Worst of all, it has disintegrated my jaw joint which has TMJ.",1
My family is trying to weigh the positive and negative effects of taking this medication.  I cannot understand why there are no concrete facts (i.e. bone density results) to essentially stand for the positive side of taking this medication.  Therefore there is no evidence at all that points to this medication working to improve osteoporosis.  The best review is that there were no side effects.  Where are the people who took the full doe of this medication?  That is our concern. ,1
"I have had 6 Prolix injections and I have seen significant improvement in the bone density in my spine. I had a T-score of -4 and it's now -2.6. I have had no side effects that I can detect - yes, I've had some minor aches and pains but I'm 69 and I expect that they are just due to aging. ",5
"As previous users of this drug have stated, I was very vary of the side effects.  I had my first injection mid November and so far so good. I have had a few aches and pains but would I have had them anyway? Probably!  I don't feel it would be justified to attribute them to the use of this drug.  I have low scored the effectiveness as it would be premature at this stage to say it has worked but I am hopeful and look forward to positive results at my next scan.  I will definitely be going for the next injection when it is due.",3
"I have read so many negative reviews about Prolia that when I went to get my first injection I was so scared and nervous.  I didn't know if I should take a chance and get it or not. I received my injection 5 days ago and have not had any negative reactions at all. I'm 61 yrs old, 5'2"", weigh 107 lbs. and am in excellent health except for having osteoporosis.  I would recommend this medication for osteoporosis. ",5
I have had four prolia shots.  I have had no side effects.  I just had my second dexascan 2 years after the first one.  My T Score for spine went from -3.0 to -2.2 and for femur from -1.8 to -1.4.  Needless to say I was very happy.  ,5
I will be having my first bone density test in a few weeks after being on Prolia for one year.  I can't wait for the results and am very optimistic that this drug is working.  I am a runner and have history of stress fractures.  Since being on Prolia I have increased my mileage and speed and have had no issues at all.  I will definitely go for my third injection next month.,5
"I received my 8th injection of Prolia a few months ago.  I have not had one single side effect - only good results. I did not listen to all of the negative comments from people and just followed the advice of my endocrinologist who has a number of people on Prolia with no side effects. I go and have my injection and forget about it.  To me it's just like a flu shot.  I do not dwell on every ache or pain thinking that it might be the Prolia.  Chances are I would of had these same aches or pains even if I was not taking Prolia injections. I am very active, gym, golf, lots of walking, and have kept my weight a very good level.  I am so sorry for all of the people who have not been able to take Prolia as it is sure better than any oral medication.    ",5
"Hi - I've had my 2nd Prolia injection recently and so far I've not had any issues - thank God. This drug is so easy to receive - and only once every 6 months. When first considering whether to start this drug or not, I almost didn't after reading a number of reviews here. My doctor spoke at length with me. He said he has approx. 150 patients on Prolia, some since it first came out and said - none - of his patients have any side effects. I hope this continues to be fine for me as I've tried other biphosphanate alternatives and they gave me unpleasant side effects so I stopped using them.",5
"Prolia is the worst drug I have ever taken, even worst than the Chem I took for breast cancer. I wish that I had studied the side effects of it before having any injection, but I trusted my oncologist and did not question this drug. It was originally for bone cancer patients and I should have never been given it for osteopenia . The side effects are horrible and I am not sure they will ever go away, but hopefully I will recover. I will never take Prolia again for osteopenia . As I said before, it is awful and the lingering side effects have outweighed the good!!!",1
"Found out I had osteoporosis at age 53.  Started Prolia treatment and calcium and vitamin D supliments.  Lowered T score in spine from -3 to -2.6 after 3 injections, which is 18 months.  Very happy and no side effects thank God.",4
"Had no pain prior to use of Prolia.  Was diagnosed with osteoporosis so decided to try Prolia because oral medications cause me problems.  After two weeks use, started having pain in hips and as time went on the pain covered both hips on a 24 hr basis.  Hips would lock up on me when shopping...would stand still to recover.  Very painful. Pain throughout the day.  It is not worth the pain to continue.",2
"took 1st shot prolia on June 12, 2015 major headaches, bone pain,ear hurts every few days, groin pain so bad I am going to get a ultrasound to make sure it didn't clog up femoral artery. MD at Cleveland clinic blew off side effects, thought I was going to the best place, now cholesterol up I am not going to take medicine for cholesterol when another med gave it to me! Have had neumerous other side effects weight gain, 6 months up Dec. 12 with less than a month to go I don't see this getting better! I will NOT take again, medical bills for side effects have been a lot, my quality of life went down the drain!Would like to hear more follow up from earlier on line comments did the side effects eventually go away? ",1
"I have just had my 8th injection of Prolia and have not had any side effects whatsoever.  I am a very active person.  I go to the gym, play golf, walk daily. I also eat healthily and keep my weight down. I go and get the injection and don't blame every ache or pain on the Prolia. My bone density scans have greatly improved and I am so very glad that I am off Fosamax. I see there are a number of negative comments on the site and I am sorry for the people that are having problems. Best wishes to everyone.",5
"Consistent low back pain which forced me to the services of a physiatrist who recently did radio frequency ablation on low back. That procedure would normally stop the back pain but did not. The Prolia in my system counteracted and prevented the procedure from working. Nagging back pain. Also frequent upper respiratory infections, which I did read were a side effect, causing frequent asthmatic bronchitis. Will soon go for bone density test to see if the benefits outweigh the horrible side   effects. Overall I would say, try bisphosphonates first. My endocrinologist recommends Reclast as an alternative but it can only be given at an infusion center ($$$!!!) and I read it also has terrible side effects. ",2
"I went through the Fosamax protocol, and followed that by 2 years of daily Forteo injections. Improved my condition but still not back to normal. Next treatment was the Prolia. I have had 3 shots, going for my 4th soon. couldn't be happier. My bones are almost normal density. Im worried what happens when the protocol stops. I am terrified of this disease. Insidious and horrible. Yes, there is the risk of brittleness, but that is preferable to barely any bone at all. this drug has worked perfectly for me. ",5
" I received the shot, and it's been at least 3 to 4 weeks,, about 4 days after I felt like a 100 year woman,, back pain , hip pain, joints and collar bone began to be in severe pain so bad I had chills. My doctors all know.. I can not take medications due to reaction I get. I went to my regular Orthopedic got ex rays of shoulder, hand, back and rib area.. he said the collar bone and ribs were badly bruised..  I had fallen about a week before but not badly.. tripped over limb in yard. My collar bone was fractured in a car accident on 12/22/11 but the doctors said the surgery was not good.. and it was not hurting and gave me no trouble until now after this medication.. Now I might possibly looking at surgery . Susan    ",1

"Do not let your elderly parent take this Prolia shot!  Extreme fatigue, headaches, loss of appetite, calcium and potassium crashes leading to low kidney function, nausea/vomiting with no counter active measures.   Shot taken 3 weeks ago and these effects are still severe with no end in sight!",1
"This is the worst drug I have ever taken. The side effects are indescribable! I regret that I did not research Prolia and my doctor did not inform me of the side effects, I would have never taken any injection had I known the damage that Prolia has done to my over all health and my body. I was being treated for osteopenia. Horrible mistake! I it was originally for patients with bone cancer, not osteoporosis or osteopenia . Please beware of this horrible drug. I have reported it to the FDA and to the drug company Amgen. I just hope the side effects go away, but at this point I am not sure I will ever be the same. Again Beware of Prolia!",1
"Thought this would be an easy alternative to the other medications treating osteoporosis at this time.  However,  had my first shot and had horrible back pain, pain in every bone and joint along with extreme fatigue.  I had to go to ER for kidney stones.  Acquired an infection in my abdomen and had to take Keflex for a month which of course caused a yeast infection. My teeth which were in very good health, only one cavity are now loose and painful.   Thought maybe all of the above was a coincidence so I went ahead and had my 2nd injection.  All the same issues as above except for the abdominal infection so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.   I will not be getting another shot.  The bone pain is horrible even morphine doesn't touch it.   ",1
Took Reclast infusions for 3 years annually. Horrible side effects. Have had no side effects from Prolia after taking injections twice a year for 2 years. Latest bone scan showed improvement from Osteoporosis to Osteopenia. Great medication in my opinion.,5
"After four(5?)injections, I experienced severe pain in my knee and shin. The pain was about an 8 or 9 on a scale of 10, and did not occur because of any fall, injury, or joint stress. It came from deep in the bone and would throb. Much worse at night, to the point that I could not sleep. I have been taking codeine for two weeks to get through the pain, and it has eased up quite a bit. But once the pain was subsiding, I experience burning sensation on the surface of the skin in the same area, followed by an outbreak of tiny blisters. Very strange symptoms. I am done with Prolia. Not worth it! ",3
"The side effects of this drug are horrible. I have gone down health wise after taking seven shots at the advise I'd my doctor. Stupid of me not to research the side effects, and was never informed of them. It took 7 shots to finally bring way down, still hurting and not sure I will ever recover from these shots!! Only had the beginning of Osteopenia and have really suffered because of Prolia!! Will never take another one. It was originally for bone cancer patients. I am not a doctor, but this horrible drug should not be given to anyone else. The cost of the shots are $1994.00. Is it all about money? It makes me suspicious and are our Doctors getting rewarded also! Warning, horrible drug. Still hurting!!!",1
"By the end of two weeks my skin on legs and hands and butt got very dry.  I developed a petechial rash on legs, butt, back & upper arms.  My skin turned red and felt like sandpaper and burned like fire.  Two weeks later I was swelling in all these horribly itchy affected places.  My legs and feet swelled 3x normal size.  Antihistamines couldn't touch it.  Went to Doctor and now am on prednisone for the hypersensitivity reaction.  This stuff can remain in your system for 12 months. Prognosis for me=unknown.  Hoping for the best as the prednisone is tapered off.  Swelling and most itching gone, but dry, cracking, peeling skin remains and no quick solution is available.  If you have sensitive skin or allergies and asthma try something else.  My Dr. says the Bone Clinic should not have given this drug.",1
"Horrible side effects, too many to fit on this page!  ",1
"I have been taking prolia 4 times. This last shot has been devastating. I have been nauseous, extremely anxious and quite depressed at times. My legs are very rubbery. I have lost a lot of weight and muscle mass. I have difficulty doing activities and yet I try to stay involved just to keep my self together somewhat. I am also very tired most of the time. I have low energy when I was extremely active. I will NEVER take this medication again. I have a little less than 3 months to get this out of my system and I am so looking forward to that happening. It is a long time yet but I am hoping it will come soon. Please do Not take this drug.",1
Just wondering if anyone experienced weight gain!  I had three injections so far and I continue to gain weight!,5
This is my third shot of Prolia...and 2nd bone Density test which the Dr. says has much improvement. I have had NO side effects from this medication and I am very happy with it. ,4
"It has been 13 days since first injection and I have experienced only minor side effects. I had a tight/sore throat type feeling which came on after a few hours of the shot and lasted  for about 10 days  (no difficulty swallowing or  breathing) and increased tinnitus of which I already had,  it just became louder. I was worried about increased pain since I am a chronic pain patient,  however, I had no increase.  This experience is so much better than with the stomach and GI issues from taking Boniva. I usually am sensitive to new meds but this has been great so far. Better than fracturing my back or hip of which I am at high risk and could result in bad things.  People need to focus on the alternative issues that could result if you don't take something. Depending on how bad your osteoporosis is, a fracture could alter your life.  Pay me now or Pay me later.  ",5
"I have had my 2nd injection.  2 weeks and I was hit with body aches and very tired.  It lasted about 1-2 weeks.  Starting to feel normal again.  I still am positive that this will work.  The side effects I have experienced are minimal and have not affected my life much.  I continue to run most every day, bike, and remain very active at work and home.  I am so hopeful and optimistic that my next bone density test will show a significant improvement!  ",2

"Started with itching skin, then progressed to delayed pressure urtacaria with caused severe itching and huge hives all over my skin. Also very stiff knee joints. I was an extremely healthy woman, running miles every day, working in a high energy job. My Dr convinced me Prolia was the only option for my osteoporosis, I wish I had never heard of the drug! It is ruining my life and should be taken off the market in my opinion. Causing major challenges to just getting through each day. Drugs are suposoed to help not debiliatate you and age you decades! DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE....trust me its too risky!",2
"the side effects of this drug are brutal! I will never take another injection & not sure my body will ever be the same.

HORRIBLE drug, with horriible side effects. ",1
"I have experienced no side effects or problems. It is difficult for me to evaluate results, since comparison of bone scans from year to year do not give a clear picture, however the radiologist assures me we have definite improvement two years after the first treatment. The last scan describes my condition as osteopenia; the previous scan classified one site as osteoporosis.",4
I had my first shot last month. It took two weeks for the bruise to go away where she gave me the shot. My arm hurts me constantly. I am having a hard time lifting anything. I can't even sleep on the arm that the shot was given. I will never have this shot again. ,1
I am recovering from a broken pelvis and got my walking up to 2 miles a day with even a burst of very fast walking and then the doctor talked me into the Prolia shot even though I had concerns.  He told me that because it was injectable drug that the side effects would not be so bad.  Wrong....Week 1 has left me feeling like a bad case of low blood sugar and hips and back hurt too bad to even vacumn the house.  I am counting the days until this will be out of my system and I can register for my Walk/Run Race in September.,1
"I am nearing the end of my first 6 month injection and will go for the second.  I have had very minor side effects, nothing that I could not tolerate, especially if it improves my bone mass.  I am a runner, and I have kept up my routine with little or no problems.  So far, I am pleasantly surprised by how good I feel.  I have tried it all, had serious side effects on Fortao and was very hesitant to try Prolia.  I will give it one more try before having my next bone density test.  That will tell me everything I need to know.",3
"Experienced many side effects such as severe headaches,muscle spasms,trembling/shaking,nausea, vomiting, etc. More importantly it has hindered my ability to heal from a bruise or a wound/cut. I have only had one treatment but I definitely will not take another. The numerous side effects are not worth it.",1
"Hi - Recently I was given Prolia but thankfully, so far -  good! I have osteoporosis and had no other alternative left than trying Prolia. (I had tried the other Biphosonates drugs which I had terrible reactions to and I've even tried ""natural"" remedies which did not help). I almost cancelled my appt. for Prolia after reading all the horror stories that sadly many on this review site have faced. My doctor then called me at home and spoke with me at length, he even looked at this review site while on the phone with me. He told me he has 150 patients on Prolia - some have taken it since it first came out and NONE have had any side effects. (I said it would be nice if they would share their reviews here.) He said he would give this drug to his mom or sister if they needed it. My bone loss was going down hill (I have copies of my scans) and was losing approx. 3% bone mass yearly. So, I will be back to report over time and hopefully I'll continue to have a positive experience to share...Best Wishes to All...",5
"Pasta girl here again: Forgot to mention when speaking with Amgen regarding test group and placebo group.  Test group received Prolia and placebo group received non active ingredients in Prolia.  Bone and muscle pain were present in both groups.    Some of my side effects: Flu like symptoms, fatique, Fibromyalgia type symptoms.  (Test was taken no Fibromyalgia) I went for a 10 min walk and developed a pain in my left inner calf. A bump the size of a small rock. Appeared on my calf.  Doctor thought it might be a Peripheral aneurysm.  Went for a Doppler.  All was negative.  Bump eased by taking hot baths and rest. Still have ringing in my ears and sciatica pain.  Never had these issues before.  Only medication I am on is Calcium pills.  Upper thighs feel like they are pulling, can't get comfortable, can't cross legs.  Often wake up with pain in low extremities. Normally, slept through the night  Burning in elbows, knee caps and spine all at the same time.  Than it goes away.  At times it feels like my neck and spine are breaking down.  Pain travels and is at different levels at different times.   Can't wait to feel better and get back to my regular work out routine. I am also sending a report to FDA.",1
"Was unable to tolorate Fasomax or Actonel.  Since I had such a drastic reaction to actonel, I did my home work with Prolia. Visited four doctors for advise. OBGYN, Endocrin, GP and Othopedist. Today is six months since I had my first and last Prolia shot.  I have been to more doctors in this six month period than any other six months in my life. If you are having bad side effects report to Amgen health professional 1-877-562-4111. Spoke with Angen 40 min.  Very informative. Amgen has no data when side effects will ease. Also learned that people who had difficulty with Fasomax and actenel were omitted from test group.  I wonder how many people having bad side effects from Prolia also had trouble with other ostro drugs? Six months later sill having side effects. I could go on and on with the side effects.  I was going to the gyn 3x a week lifting serious weights. Walking eight miles a day at work. Now unable to lift half the weight amount and have pain that lasts for weeks after a work out.  Could anyone advise when their bones and muscle pain eased.  Did they take hot baths, heating pad, physcial therapy? Advil and Vicodim only work, occasionally.    Thank you   ",1

NEVER !!! Update four months after the first and what will be my last injection. After the swelling of my face along with burning sensation I also experienced facial tics in my face. I have had several urinary tract infections and yeast infections. The pain has been terrible throughout the last four months. My teeth hurt so badly it feels like I need fillings. After symptoms ease they become sever again with each release it's like starting over. ,1
"Severe, constant itching....been through 3x's on Steroids to stop itching...worked for a day or two but then back to itching. Been through so many different creams & lotions (Rx & OTC) and no relief from Dermotologist.  Am due for my 2nd dose of Prolia and I'm seriously considering refusing.  My body is so scratched up and blotchy and my doctor says it should not have caused this itching so long. Glad to see others have had the same problem.  More and more with ALL the negative side effects (I also did 6 months of 1/week Actonel and hated that, too!) of all these Osteoporosis drugs, I'm seeing none of them are worth taking.  Thank you to the drug companies for making so much money off of lousy products with unforeseen side effects.  Your warnings should be taken more seriously by the consumers...  Bet the higher-ups in the drug companies would never recommend to family & friends these products....",1
"Horrible side effects, hurting so badly that I thought something terrible was wrong with my whole body. Rashes, itches, whole digestive system messed up. Will never take another shot again. It should be banded! A total nightmare experience!!",1
"It has been one year since my injection and I am still suffering side effects - balance problems, vertigo and pressure in my neck and head.  Had to stop working and taking PT to help with balance.  Worst decision I ever made.  I will take calcium and Vit D and live with the osteoporosis.",2
I am very satisfied with Prolia which I have been taking for just over 18 months. My bone mass has increased significantly and now I am no longer considered to have osteoporosis.  Previously I had been taking a number of other medications and my bone mass continued to deteriorate.  I am not aware of any side effects and am also pleased by the ease of use.,5
I have been receiving Prolia injections for more than 2 years and have never had one side effect. Every year my bone density has improved.,4
I have just received my 7th injection of Prolia and I am so glad to say that I have had no problems during the 3 1/2 years.  I was so very glad to not have to take oral medication such as Fosamax. I am so sorry to the people posting that have had negative reactions. My bone density tests have all been very positive!  ,5
"With my first shot last summer, I did not connect my hip pain to the Prolia.  With my second shot in December of 2014, after a few weeks, I began experiencing the debilitating lower back and more severe hip pain as described by many other users.  My quality of life is in the dumper and I am taking physical therapy without much improvement.  I cannot walk through the grocery store, walk my dog, clean my house, and can barely stand up for more than a few minutes without the pain bringing me down. I am convinced that all of this pain has been brought on by the two Prolia injections I have had.  I, like many others, hope it will be out of my system by the end of this six month dosage period. I would recommend not taking it.  The last few months have been a nightmare.  DON'T DO IT!",1
"Beware of hearing loss! Gradual hearing loss coincided with the start of Prolia shots at the age of 54. After almost 4 years of increasing tinnitus and marked hearing loss, I am convinced, despite my doctor's opinion to the contrary, that Prolia is responsible. I have always guarded my hearing (no listening to music with ear buds, no exposure to loud noise, no occupational exposure). The ENTs have told me it is ""age-related"" hearing loss; my older siblings have no such impairment, so I think not. Be your best advocate: listen to your body, you know it best, and follow your instincts. I'd rather live with osteoporosis than lose my hearing completely. I am no longer in denial and will fight my doctor on this one (or find another). Done with Prolia and am now about to purchase hearing aids at the age of 58.  Doctors and pharmaceuticals profit from one another. Just don't let it be at the expense of your good health.",1
"First Prolia shot, not a problem.  Second one devastating.   Itching, swollen lips, and severe pain in right hip.  Pain does not improve.  DON'T take this drug.  Dangerous !! Feel miserable.....",1
"It's almost 2 mos. since the prolia injection, and I'm still itching like crazy all over. I felt icky for several weeks, my immune system was weakened. I am going for natural methods to combat the bone density issue. NO MORE PROLIA or any of those other rat poison drugs for this !",1
"NEVER !!! Would I have agreeded to Prolia if I had known the pain and medical problems I would experience. Back pain kidney pain along with kidney infection, swelling of the face arms and legs. Muscle spasms. My skin on my face and arms at times feels like my skin is burning. One night I woke up and the burning sensation was in my face forehead and I felt like my brain was on fire.  My quality of life has deteriorated where I was active before after one injection I'm mostly sitting in a chair with heating bags on my back stomach and legs. March 12/15 will be two months after the first and last injection. I wrote to the Canadian government and called to company. Sometimes the pain is so bad I told my husband I don't think I could tolerate this for another four months. I'm a fighter and my pain tolerance high but Prolia has had terrible effect on my body. I've had so many side effects I can't list them all. ",1
"I take prolia the last 2 years. It is very efficient on me since all the indicators in blood tests are better than before. Each time, 4 and a half months after the injection I have terrible back, toe and muscle pains. I usually take the next shot after 5 and a half months after the injection ,so the pains last one month. I would like to ask soeone who has experienced the same pains if after the 6 months these pains stop. Thank you.",5
"I had the Prolia injection on Jan, 30, 2015. The only side effect I have experienced is dizziness when I lean over. This started the week of Feb. 22, 2015. So far I have had no other side effects. ",3
" i had surgery 5 years ago to remove part of parathyroid. I am now 66 and had been in good health since the surgery. Due to one bone part in the osteoporosis level this year, my ob/gyn prescribed Prolia for me.... After the injection i did not have any unusual reactions or allergies....however,the doctor did not notice my parathyroid condition and i was not aware this would be an issue.  I received the shot 7 months ago and have been fairly miserable since.  It took many tests and 4 months to  discover the cause for my symptoms..i should not have had any Prolia!  I,ve had daily spells of severe weakness in legs, tinglings, foggy brain, spells of depression and severe anxiety,was on a heart monitor for unusual aryethmias,had recurring feelings of thickness in my neck, and much fatigue on a daily basis.  i spent 2 months sitting in chairs with no energy or desire to do anything.  someone finally said..""what about that Prolia ?""  more blood tests and MRI and finally and endocronologist who understood ..5 months later....I had been fine for 2 months after the shot and then it all collapsed....i am much better now..regulating my calcium and vit D..This is the seventh month..i'm much better,and glad to be getting closer to my usual active self. So..if you have any parathyroid issues..tell your doctor,don't assume they know everything about you or the new meds they want to give you..Patient beware !! I prefer a broken bone! my doctor wants me to try Fortea..but I don't think so...yet!",1
I would NEVER get another injection of Prolia. Worst pain in my bones that I have ever felt in my entire life in lower back and hips.  Plus itching intensely. Would rather have another broken bone.,1
"FU to previous posts. Now almost 4 mos after 1st injection. Not much improvement in symptoms to this poison. Did have to go to ER 2 times in Dec. for all the things this has done to me. RA, IBS, Back and Thigh pain all much worse. I can't eat because of the bad digestion probs I am experiencing now. Bad Headaches just won't go away. Generally not able to function well anymore. Confusion, Depression no improvement. I have hopefully finally gotten rid of ALL the bacterial infections that I have encountered since 10/15/2014. I have contacted FDA and will be filling reports on this medicine. My Drs. only comment to me over the phone was ""Oh, you had history of bad bacterial infections!"" Oh well, won't be seeing him again. I still go to the hospital infusion center that gave me the injection monthly for another medicine injection not related to this treatment and the Nurse who is in charge won't even look at me when I go in. I am not encouraged that these symptoms will improve in short time after reading some of these reviews. Please be advised that this medicine IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! Take care.",1
"Since I started taking this six-monthly shot, my osteoporosis has decreased from medium risk to low risk.  I had tried some oral medication before taking Prolia 60 mg subcutaneous but they did not work for me.",4
"Swollen lips day after injection followed by terrible inflammation on face, eyes and other areas of body. Needed to be on prednisone for 8 mos. to control reaction. Took a year for symptoms to subside. Still have lingering side effects after almost 2 years from first (and only) injection. Definitely would NOT recommend Prolia. ",1
I have Chronic Migraine and after the 4th day I began the worst migraine that lasted 5 days.  I went to the Er and the following day to outpatient for more drugs. Nothing would help.  I would research this carefully before taking and will update this if I have more issues.,1
"I just received my 4th injection 2 months ago and this will be my last.  I have suffered horrible back ache, tingling and numbness in hands that keep me awake at night.  Has also caused frequent urination with discomfort, stomach cramps all day and overall flu like symptoms on a daily basis.  I prefer to stay off all these so called drugs as the side effects are not worth it and I felt so much better before these injections.  If your thinking of using this drug, please research and reconsider.",2
"My 83 yo mother was given a Prolia shot 9/14.  After 3 weeks she developed a lung infection, and felt flu like- pain in her hips, and general ill feeling.  Loss of appetite, weight, & energy.  She is always tired & it has made her COPD symptoms much worse.  When we reported all this to her Dr. she said - well there's nothing we can do about it- and questioned her ""tiredness"". She said she had not heard of this side effect.  Apparently she has not been on this site or many others.  This is a terrible drug for elderly people.  My mom was active, & drove herself everywhere- she hasn't been out of her house for 2 months except to go to the Dr. & she needed a wheelchair to get into her appointment. She can't drive or run her own errands because she is TOO TIRED & WEAK.  How this drug was ever approved is a mystery to me.  She did fine when she took weekly medications for bone loss.  What a ridiculous drug to give to anyone.  DO NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS DRUG.  It should be taken off the market. The potential side effects are too serious to take a chance.  ",1
After reading 400 reviews I was terrified to try this drug knowing that it would be in my system for 6 months. I have a hard time tolerating medicine. I usually quit before I finish.  I also have a hard time swallowing so this was a good option. I decided to try and hope for the best. To my surprise it is now 2 months after my shot. It was easy to get the shot and I  have not had any side effects at all. Now I'm done for 6 months. Not sure about effectiveness yet but I am hopeful it's working. Please listen to your gut and not other people's reviews.   ,3
"CAUSED PAIN IN BONES, BACK,LEGS, DRY MOUTH, CAUSED SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS.  DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG THE SIDE effects last?    ",1
"This is an update to my previous post 3 days ago. I am now in a real mess because of this one injection of Prolia. Heart racing, face and ankles swelling, red flush on body and face, sores on gums, left and right jaw pain, 3rd bladder infection in 2 mos, 1 vaginal infection, itching, confusion, depression, insomnia, back and joint pain increased even with narcotic meds, terrible flu like symptoms, bad cholesterol shot up, as did blood pressure. No one can really tell you when these symptoms will go away. Hopefully by the 6 month. If you have a history of infections of any type you should not consider this drug for use I have now been advised. I will not take another injection of this med. My Dr. said the side effects would  be mild. He is now backing up on that. I have been told that some patients with other illnesses ie fibromyalgia, polymyalgia could be a reason. When I spoke with the mfg. Argen rep about this he said he had no other data on the side effects other than the back, hip and thigh pain. I believe these comments here say otherwise. Please use this with the greatest of care.           ",1
"took first injection 10/15/2014. Have had 3  infections, serious itching, blurred vision, skeletal pain, difficulty walking, sleeping and breathing. DO NOT DO THIS DRUG. IT CAN KILL YOU. ",1
"With just one dose of this drug, I have experienced severe hip and lower back pain,  urinary track infection and a  fractured right hip  and requiring a total hip replacement.  During the hospitalization for that I had to have 2 units of PRBC's and an IV infusion of calcium.  My 3 week rehab then turned into 3 months because my femur would not heal right.  I have MS and I wonder if the drug trials involved any one with an auto immune disease.  We have had to remodel our bathrooms, etc. so I can live at home.  A $200.00 shot has cost us thousands.  I am so sorry that I took this medication.  I am an RN, so am aware of medications.",1
"I have been taking Prolia for 2 years and have had increasing thigh pain in my right femur, pain in my right glute, pain in my left upper arm. Extreme, to the point of not being able to sleep, climb stairs with alternate feet or walk for more than a mile. My cholesterol also shot up to unhealthy levels. I watch my diet and am normally an active 64 year old woman bug this medicine has negatively affected my quality of life!",2

Last, tell people within your circle about the effects this Drug has on your, Quality of life, the lack of information from the doctors , the difficulty in getting answers from Amgen etc.    FDA needs to review this drug.",1
Thank you Amgen for this wonderful drug! Just had my fourth injection this week and got the results from deca. In 18 my bmi went up 13% :) They strive for 4% yearly and mine went up 13% in 18 mos.!! I was so happy and I started shaking when I was leaving the office.   So sorry for so many of you who are having so many problems. wish u could have my luck.  ,5
"The injection was fine.....The after affects are horrible.  I can move my arms backwards or even unclip my bra with out being in horrible pain.  I like to play golf but if this continues this will be out the window.  My arm muscles feel like i worked out for hours lifting weights.  Pain is worse than the fibromyalgia that I also have.  I will not take again, the pain is unreal in my arms.",1
"Had first injection for osteoporosis - within one week began having severe thigh, hip and back pain and had a serious respiratory infection which required antibiotics.  Dizziness and balance problems. Doc agrees - I will not be taking another shot.",2
"Just saying, When your doctor recommended Prolia, did they say this drug has little to no side effects? Interesting to me that my four doctors said the exact same thing.  (Same sales pitch) Little to no side effects. For all the people who are suffering here know this is clearly not true. Than when I had major difficulty, my doctor's looked at me dumbfounded.  Didn't have a clue what to do. You would think Amgen would have some number in place so doctors could call for information and guidance.  One doctor told me, ""Oh the sales rep from Amgen was in here two days ago, you should speak with him""  REALLY? Speak with a sales rep. for my medical issues??? If this happened in your case, the FDA needs to be made aware of the sales reps presentation and Amgen's lack of safety net for people suffering side effects.",1
"Took 1st shot Oct 2013. Experienced extreme exhaustion, muscle aches.  2nd shot April 2014.  Developed urinary tract infections one right after the other as well as lower abdomen pain.  Will not be taking a 3rd shot!",2
"Although I just received my 1st injection on June 1st, I started having bad muscle and joint pain throughout my body, bad back pain, sciatica, tiredness and low energy. It is now the end of June and for the last 2.5 weeks, I have not been able to do my PT exercises & stretches. If this is the way it will be for 5 more months, I will not have another injection. No one should have to suffer this bad as a result of trying to protect their bones!",1
"Although I questioned thoroughly about pancreatitis & other side effects, I was assured this injection was safe. I had given self-injections for 2 yrs of Forteo. Within in weeks of 1st Prolia injection, I did not feel well. Body pain, fibromyalia, increased reflux & pancreatitis within 3months. ER with lots of very expensive imaging tests. Still being monitored with blood tests. NO more Prolia!",3
"2 Hours after injection 3+ months ago, I had onset of severe jaw, neck, chest, arm, leg, back, and hip pain, followed shortly by extremely sore, red tongue. I was very short of breath as well. I started feeling almost normal just one week ago.  I will NOT get a second injection. I had pneumonia post inj. and my pulmonary hypertension has gotten worse! I truly regret agreeing to the Prolia. I feel that it took 3+ months of my life from me, and I am not sure if I will totally recover from the side effects!",1
"I am so thankful I didn't read these reviews before starting this drug. I've had 3 injections and have experienced only a few side-effects starting at about the 10th day, mostly just aching bones, that lasts for 3 weeks(+-). Every person's body reacts differently to drugs. Don't make the decision not to use Prolia based on what other people have written - seriously, how many people take the time to write good experiences versus bad ones. Discuss your concerns with your own doctor and decide from there what is the best treatment choice for you. ",3
have aches and pains 7-10 days after injection.  after 3 months symptoms ease.,3
"I have had 4 Prolia injections, beginning in October 2011. I have back pain which has gotten progressively more severe, and with my doctor's approval I have decided no more Prolia, as my quality of life has been affected and I have had to give up playing piano and organ. Sitting on a bench without a back is now too painful. I have osteoporosis and I am 72 years old. ",1
I am loosing my hair,1
"I had taken Prolia in January and after 3 solid months of limping and not being able to exercise or even clean my home, the pain started to lift and I was at least relieved to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but the new news is after 3 months of feeling back to normal, I am now experiencing the exact same symptons and its been past the 6 month time.  Can anyone tell me that this drug continues to evolve????",1
"Look up FDA update Prolia : it should direct you to Drug safety labeling changes. See June 2014 Prolia update: Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking Prolia.  The time of on set of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting Prolia. Consider discontinuing use if sever symptoms develop.

"Very bad jaw pain soon after taking the prolia injection,  took second injection because it was believed that the jaw pain was very rare side effect and it wasn't taken seriously.  Took second injection 6 months later and jaw pain was terrible stopped prolia after second injection, after prolia was out of my system the jaw pain was gone and never returned I think it's safe to say the prolia was the cause.",3
It has been over 3 months since my 1st injection.  I have pain in my lower back and hips.  Occasionally sharp (level 10) pain in my thigh.  I have little energy and am depressed.  Don't know about getting 2nd injection.,1

"Had my first injection on 09 June, and within days I started falling apart. I had no idea what was causing, hip pain, back pain, excessive gas, burning and tingling in feet and hands, blurred vision, pain in muscles. My employer wanted me to go to the doctor because I was having trouble walking. She was convinced I had hurt myself, I hadn't. So I decided last night to look online and when I found all these reviews I came to understand what was happening. My hope is that the effects stop soon, I still have 5 months to go. I will NOT be taking another injection. I have seen other's that say it is save and effective, maybe so, but at what cost?",1

"I am so glad that I found this site.  My doctor prescribed Prolia for me today.  I have used two other products that made me very ill with symptoms like what most of you describe.  I will not be going on Prolia. It sounds as ""poisonous"" as the other two I tried.  Not sure what the solution is though.",1
I have severe head abd neck pain and severe abdominal pain since this medication was administered to me 2 months ago.,1
"I have had 6 injections with no adverse reactions.  It's like a flu shot!  Once taken you can forget about it for 6 months.  I have been on Prolia for 3 years now.  After 5 years, according to my endocrinologist, I will go off for a few years.  Sorry for the people who are having all of these side effects. Some of these side effects may be coincidental and have absolutely nothing to do with Prolia.  ",5
5 days after taking I have gait problem walking and then my hands became numb. ,1
I am scheduled for my first Prolia injection in July 2014.,1
Only posting because my experience (four injections to date) has been very positive with absolutely no adverse reactions. Naturally a little muscle soreness at injection site that disappears  in a few days. Superior results to Fosamax (ten years duration).  Here in Canada it's not yet covered by our provincial health insurance (unlike Fosamax) so the injection costs me $480 semi-annually. But well worth it. Highly recommended.  ,5
"I broke my back three times and used forteo inj for two yrs. Apparently It did not work and was told I neede Prolia. I asked my doc if there was any side effects? He said you might get a skin irritation or could get a rash. Two wks I was ok thinking cool Nothing will happen. During my third wk I started hurting so bad. My bones and muscles and every part of me is killing me. Pain pills do not work anymore. Can not urinate without hurting. I cant do anything, I cant hardly move!! I have to be pulled out of bed or off a chair. It is the most horrible thing that has happened to me. My stomach hurts daily. My foot looks like a balloon. Horrible pain in my left side. Stiff body. ear hurts. Throat hurts. Jaw hurts. I would not say for people not to use it as everyone is different but this is some of the things it has done to me. I will NOT get another shot. I agree with the one woman who said a Dr should try it first! I don't care if you are a doctor or not, You have no clue until it is in your system!!!",1
I had my fourth injection today. I have never had any side effects. I had a bone density scan in January and my bone density had increased to the point where my spine density is no longer considered osteoporosis. I am very sorry for the people that have had adverse reactions because for me this drug has been a miracle.,4
"I just had my third injection of Prolia and may be one of the lucky ones.  I had been taking Boniva through infusion and had horrible side effects.  With Prolia, I have not had any negative side effects.  It is an injection that takes less than a minute to administer and only needs to be done once every 6 months!  Am having another bone scan in 2 months and am hoping my T scores have improved.  ",5
"I see comments from some saying ""ignore the bad reviews, this drug worked fine for me"" and I have to say do so at your own peril.  I followed their advise and ignored the warnings and ended up angry that this drug was ever approved and at those who try to make those who had bad experiences appear to be whiners.  I have to wonder if they actually work for Amgen, considering the sheer volume of us I've found online.  Something is seriously wrong here.  One week after my shot (October 2012) I had an infection of the jawbone and it only went downhill from there.  I was sick, in and out of my doctor's office and the hospital for 6 months, but it didn't end there.  i had bone infections, pain in my thigh, lung infections, shingles, anemia and caught everything that was within 15 miles of me.  I'm pretty sure that my immune system was completely shut down and is still, eighteen months later only working at 1/4 of what it used to be.  I took this drug to prevent fractures, but it robbed me of my life for at least six months.  i do not think the cost was worth it and am pretty much convinced now that this is a scam and we are the guinea pigs.  They had to cancel the trials on multiple myeloma patients because 2x as many of them died when using Prolia.  I'm not sure why some have reactions and others don't, but I think it is highly questionable to allow these drug dealers to put this out there without having a clue.  To make it appear as though the side effects are a minimal risk when clearly they are not and to give the impression that the side effects are harmless when they are debilitating (which my OP was not) is at best disingenuous.  I would never take this drug again and my doctor agrees.",1
"I took Prolia subcutaneous at the recommendation of my Dr. I WILL NOT TAKE IT AGAIN.  I have been miserable...leg cramps, hand cramps, (back and abdominal cramps at times. Pain in my flank, back, legs, and shoulders, fluid retention...According to the manufacturer you take this every 6 months, I have another 2 months for this to wear off, understandably osteoporosis is a huge concern, but quality of life is also an issue and this has made mine awful...I do not recommend anyone taking this!!!!",1

"Soon after my doctor gave me a shot of Prolia in Aug. 2013 to prevent osteoporosis I developed mild pain in the bones of my jaw, only in the molars where I have crowns, although I take good care of my teeth.  This subsided and then I developed pain in my hips and thighs.  I did not take the second shot due in Feb. 2014, but I am still feeling muscular and joint pains in different parts of my body, some excruciating, that come and go and seem to be travelling from one area to another. Recently I had excruciating pain in my right jaw, I could not open my mouth for one or two days, then it went away and moved to my left hand, then the right leg, then the left leg.  Now the pain is in my right knee and left ankle.  If I try to massage the area like for normal muscle pain, it gets worse.  I am a healthy person, have normal annual physicals, I eat right, exercise, I used to do yoga, now sometimes I cannot even walk right.  I reported this to the FDA and called Amgen to find out if they had any idea when this toxic substance will be out of my system.  They don't give you specific answers because it is a new drug and they don't know what the long term side effects are.",1
"I had breathing problems for 2 months, ear blockage for 5 months(still have), infection in diverticulitis needed 24 days of IV medication, chest tightness and tiredness.  I had one shot in July and am still feeling the effects with my ears and I may be deaf from it.",1
"I had my first shot in January and by end of February started having pain and throbbing in my legs.  My left hip hurt terribly for a couple weeks and then it moved to my right hip and legs where I was limping and unable to go up stairs with my right side leading.  I have spent a full 2 months tired, in pain and even visiting the doctor begging for pain pills that had no effect at all.  It is now the 3rd month and I am walking better but the throbbing and effort to get up and start moving smoothly is tough.  I have not exercised in 2 months as it seemed to aggravate it.  Massage therapy aggravated it as well.  I will never take this drug and plan on living a healthier lifestyle with exercise if that's even possible as I wait every day for this to get better!",1
"I just had my first shot yesterday,  April 11, 2014 after 2 years of being scared to take it - despite my very low bone density scores of -2.5 in hips and -3.4 in the spine.  I am a 57 year old female with a genetic disposition for the disease. After a freak tibia-plateau fracture 4 years ago, I learned I had severe osteo and I changed my diet, started working out with weights 3 times weekly, and used Forteo for 2 years.  Unfortunately, the Forteo was not as successful for me as for most.        I have been absolutely petrified to take this shot, but 3 doctors in 3 different cities suggested I strongly try it.        I am documenting daily the effects.  Yesterday after the shot I had itching and pain in my muscles - not bad, though.   It was difficult to fall asleep last night. Today I have experienced itching in a variety of places and cramps in my calves and thighs.",2
"WOW! I am so thankful I came across this website. I have taken Prolia 2 times. At first didn't notice any difference, as I had a heart attack before that, and put all the symptoms down to that, lethargy,fatique, the whole bit, until the last few months. I started with back pain, had shots for that, but since my last shot of Prolia in January have had horrible pain in my groin, hip and back.I am due to see the doctor in a couple days, and sure will take some of these reviews with me. Thanks so much. Maybe I will get my life back in a few months. I pray it does not have any lasting effects after the six months is up!",1
3 months after my 1st and last Prolia injection I developed aching arms and legs to the point I had difficulty walking and lifting my arms up. Had severe headaches and eventually was diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis. Am now on prednisone and told I will be for 18 months. Fortunately I started Prednisone before losing my eyesight due to the Temporal Arteritis. I wish I had never taken Prolia and feel I should have been told about the drug when it was prescribed.,1
"I have had my second shot of Prolia for my Osteoporosis February 2014.I have become very ill from this drug.  Three severe lung infections over the past 6 months, 2 chest X-rays, antibiotics, SEVERE! cough, Severe chest pain, leg cramps, skin irritations, exhaustion,loss of sleep, watering eyes,runny nose, hearing loss...it goes on and on. I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER take this medication again. Finally my physician said all my illness must be stemming from the Prolia. I have been a very healthy and active person prior to taking this med. I called the FDA and reported all side effects and I filled out the forms they sent to me.  I recommend that you do the same, either call or go on FDA web site.  This is a toxic drug with miserable and devastating side effects. Please reconsider taking this medication if your Dr. prescribes this. READ, inform yourself, ask questions. The severe side effects are NOT worth the potential????help from the drug. Get a second, third opinion. Cherish your beloved life.    ",1
"I previously wrote regarding side affects from prolia. Amgen Health advised me to have my hearing checked as I wear hearing aides and cannot hear well with them on anymore. I had my hearing test today. Since my last hearing test in July 2013, one month before taking the second Prolia shot, I have lost 25% more of my hearing.  I was told that this amount of hearing loss in 7 months is unpresented with no injury.  You could not pay me to take prolia again.  I had a serious lung infection for 3 month, sharp increase in cholesteral and now hearing loss.   Stay away from this toxic drug!!! ",1
"After 3rd shot: Bronchitis for 2 1/2 months, 2 Dr visits, RX antibiotic,  At same time:  Eye twitching, 2 eye Dr visits, MRI neg, Dental visit w/neg CT scan,  Primary Phy said he never heard of all these problems from Prolia,  Currently:  Skin breaking out in severe rash, itch;  watery eye, running nose, swelling in eye lid.  Last shot (3rd) was 3 months ago.  All that Dr's do is tests with neg results.   So far Fosamax gave me hives which sent me to E/R so that's out.  Boniva caused heartburn which also required E/R.  Actonel gave me issues too.   ",1
"I have been on Prolia for a year and had two shots.  Two months after my second shot I developed bronchitis and was put on medication.  I never got better and continued to be sick with a terrible cough and difficulty breathing. I was in the ER for this.  Finally a pulmonologist saw me and said I had a serious deep lung infection, possibly Community Acquired MRSA. I have been on a heavy duty antibiotic for 3 weeks and finally am starting to feel better.  My LDL Cholesterol jumped 40 points in the last 4 months. I am having hearing difficulties and terrible cramping in my legs and feet.  I called Amgen Health as suggested by another reviewer and they feel all of my problems are probably related to the Prolia. Needless to say, NO MORE Prolia for me.  The cure is worse than the condition it is treating. ",1
"Porila Since this requires you to score the drug I gave it 1's. I am terrified of this drug that is being shoved on me by my ENDO. I react to over half of the side effects, and it is saying may cause hearing loss. I've already lost half the hearing in my left ear. I have Meniere's and this drug causes Vertigo, I HAVE DRUG INDUCED OP CAUSED BY USING SYNTHROID 29 YEARS. NOT ONCE HAVE I BEEN TOLD SYNTHROID CAUSED OP OR THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM OR D, UNTIL 4 YRS AGO. EVEN THEN I WAS NOT INFORMED THAT THE SYNTHROID CAUSED THE OP. DX +3.1 AND I THINK IT IS HIGHER AS MY HIPS HAVE STARTED TO HURT,But MY RATIONED Medicare/TRICARE have cut Bone Density test to once every 2 yrs. THANKS TO OBAMA's and Congresses GUT OF BOTH PROGRAMS!",1
"I had my first Prolia shot in Oct.""13. About 6 weeks later had had horrible pain in hip, calve and a numb foot- horrible. I had xrays, an ultrasound and rounds of acupuncture, took Tramadol. NOTHING helped. No one could tell me what was wrong . Then it dawned on me, the Prolia! I am due for a second shot in April. There is no way I am going thru that again. and I can not tolerate oral meds. I intend on just continuing my calcium and Vit. D",1
"I have had terrible muscle pain in my neck since the first injection (have had 2). Does anyone else have this problem? Also, after 1st injection (about 3 wks) I got a bladder infection. I am 2 weeks out on my 2nd shot.",2
"Bone mass loss recently put me in the category of osteoporosis. Have had two injections. I was a healthy active person with no other medical history. A few weeks after the 2nd injection I experienced hip and back pain that completely changed my life. The cost of the drug pales in comparison to what I have paid out for various therapies. The pain was severe and totally inexplicable; I did not 'hurt' my back, had done nothing unusual. I am a fit person and am not overweight. It is slowly easing up  2 months later. I don't know what to do next as I can't tolerate the oral meds. But one thing's for sure…I regret taking Prolia in the first place, wish I had done my research and will NOT take Prolia again. I'm happy for those who have had no side effects but they seem to be in the minority.",1
"I have had three Prolia injections and the side effects make the drug intolerable for me. Each time I received an injection I began to feel very ill within five days. Hip pain so severe that walking was difficult, couldn't raise my right leg to sit on couch - had to lift it up. Ribs were so sore I couldn't touch them, severe fatigue, bladder infection, felt so crummy that I really didn't care whether I lived or died. It has been 25 days since the current vaccination and I am finally feeling better, thanks to Cipro and Percocet. I'm not sure why the side effects have worsened with each shot, but I do know that I will not be taking this drug again. ",1
Hell and I hope I survive all the the health problems Prolia has caused. Should be taken off the market.,1
I am about to have my 5th injection of Prolia.  I've just had a bone density test and have a 10% improvement in my hips and spine. My doctor (endocrinologist) has told me that even if there is not any improvement and the bones remain the same that that is good!  When taking Fosamax my bones decreased with each scan.  I'm very happy. I do go to the gym 3x a week and am very active.  I have not had any side effects.  It's just like a flu shot for me.  I get the shot and then forget about it for 6 months.,5
I am still feeling great and due for first dexa scan in February. I also have my appt. for my 3rd Prolia injection in February. Will keep everyone posted!,3
"My 1st injection was a yr ago, and my 2nd was a month ago.  This 2nd time, I had to get pre-approval, but no one told me that the patient cost was $900.  Also, within a day or so, I was nauseated, dizzy, weak, flu type symptoms -- all these lasted a week.  Now, my hands/fingers hurt so bad & my left thumb can't even button my blouse.  After reading the FDA letter to physicians & the $900. bill I am stuck with, I doubt I will ever take again.  I have been on Femara 6 yrs (aromatase inhibitor) - but will try to figure out other treatments: more vitamins, etc.  Feeling horrible & all the risks aren't worth spending $900.",3
Was given this 3 months ago along with my 4th shot of LUPRON.  Low bone density from age and Lupron shots - Prostate Cancer treatment after operation.  No side effects noticed / Dr. never told me what this was or what to expect - Go figure.  Will jump his butt next time!,3
I took about 3 injections with no recognizable side effects but continued to have bone loss. Just had a bone scan showing the bone loss. Now on to Reclast.,1
"I haven't had any side effects like I do with Boniva and the others where I can't swallow, but the jury is still out on whether it's helping or not. I won't know until my next bone scan.",4
"Hi !!  I previously wrote a very positive comment in regards to Prolia! Today I am getting my 4th Prolia shot. I am doing awesome Ladies! I still go to the Gym 4-5 times a week, doing 3 miles of Cardio a day & TRX training for over a year. My Bone Density has improved over 10% I have OFFICIALLY REVERSED OSTEOPEROSIS!!! The only issues I have is a little osteopenia in my left hip..I feel Awesome Due to Exercise, Organic Foods, New Chapter Bone Strength Vitamins, Other Excellent Vitamins,and Prolia..No side effects other than tired for 1st 2 days. I am now going to be a Gym Instructor & get Certified! Please don't let the negative reviews scare you, I think most negative reviews could be symptomatic issues before the shot. If you take good care of your body, Eat healthy, Stay active! You will do awesome!! Cheers to Good Health!!! I feel Wonderful I don't feel 52more like 40",5
"My first injection was 9 months ago.  Real easy to get a shot.  No side effects at all.  Then my 2nd shot 3 months ago.  I haven't been able to sleep at night because of the severe back, leg and hip pain.  Didn't know until today that it was the Prolia that was causing it.  I sure wish I had read some reviews instead of the pamphlet that came with the medicine before I agreed to take it.  Real life experiences of other people tell you more than what a doctor can.  If I had to do it over again I would not take this drug.  My hips and legs hurt so bad now that I cannot rest.  I am more fatigued than ever.  I realize drugs react on different people in different ways.  Just make sure you read and research and make an educated decision, not just on the advice of your doctor.  Some of them ""sell"" drugs while prescribing the latest and greatest thing.  I won't be taking another shot.  Good luck with your decision.",1
"look, i have osti and RA and have severe stomach issues due to FDA, PIGGY BIG PHAR, PIGGY ORTHODOX MED COMMUNITY; I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS OR ANY OF THESE DRUGS IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!!  Good reviews here are Piggy pharm and pot kept me off this crap for over 10 years!!!  THESE DRUGS ARE NO GOOD, USE MED MARY JANE FOR RA, i resent having to take ib pro or any of this crap now that i can no longer get med. mary these people promoting this crap are the devil",1
"It's been a few months since I got my first injection. A few weeks after I received the shot I started having pain in my lower back, knees, right hip and shoulders. It has worsened so much that I wake up at night and have to roll gingerly to my other side due to great pain. I have a crack in a molar. Yesterday I found out that my insurance company was charged over $9,000.00 for the one injection. I called the hospital and they claimed that was correct. That is outrageous. Of course I will not be getting another injection. I am 62 years old but now I feel like I am 92. ",1
"I have had two injections of Prolia and one bone scan showing no improvement.  The respones here focus on ease of taking the medication and frequent side effects.  I have not had negative side effects and so my focus is on effectiveness.  I find little in these reviews that addresses effectiveness of Prolia.  The over all rating gives 3 stars to effectiveness, that is little more than 50 percent.  I need more information to assess the effectiveness of Prolia, which is all that is important, not just that you feel great after a shot or two. ",1
"I am not certain of the effectiveness of Prolia. I was injected on September 12, 2013. Since that time I have lost a great deal of strength, had pains in my jaw, but more pronounced in the hip joint. The weakness has caused my light case of asthma to be much more pronounced and have struggled to breath. My blood count dropped and I was hospitalized for two days. Also I have been to the ER.",1
I am trying to get my insurance to approve Prolia. Any help on how you get it paid by ins?,1
"had side effects within a few hours of injection, started with muscle tightness and tightness in the chest then went on to feeling of weakness and tiredness. At three weeks I have flu like symptoms, swollen tongue and tightness in throat. Taking antihistamines as required to calm bouts of stronger symptoms. Will take my chances and not continue this medication. ",1
"Three months after my 2nd shot I started having severe pain in my neck, arms, thigh, groin and hip area, all of my joints and muscles.  My GP gave me pain shots for two weeks.  That was five months ago and it has eased up some, but I cannot walk the two miles three times a week that I was doing before I took this medication. I've tried Tylenol 3, Advil, and Aleve. My shoulder joints hurt so bad at night I can hardly sleep.  They told me it was out of my system three months after the second shot even though it was supposed to last six months; not so, I think it just kicked in.  The person who gave me the shots said it couldn't be the Prolia, but I certainly didn't have all of this before I took it.I'll never take it again.",1
I am due for my 5th injection of Prolia.  I had a bone density test done a few weeks ago and was very happy to see that there has been a significant improvement!  I do not have any side effects from Prolia.  I took Fosamax for 5 years and got progressively worse results with adverse side effects from the Fosamax.  I'm very glad to be off of it.  ,5
"Severe, constipation! Severe gastric pain! Headaches, Migraines, spend my days in bed, more then once. This has been hell. Will be a mo on Nov 25. I cannot believe I have to go through this misery for over five more mos. I keep hoping please let it end. Never,never, again. My whole body hurts. Now I know first hand what lab animals go through. Nothing should suffer like this.",1
Last injection caused extreme tirdness for 4 or 5 day before returning to normal.,1
"After first injection, cholesterol went way up. Immediatley after second injection, started having lower back spasms and eventually servere hip, leg, groin pain and could not walk. Had to have epidural to ease pain.  I will NOT get another injection. Dr's don't seem to be aware of the serious side effects of this drug.",1
I have had 1 shot back in May 2013 due for 2nd one but do not think I will take it. The pain in spine and then in left hip has gotten so bad I can barely walk. It feels like a sharp stick is sticking me in a open wound in my left hip and groan area. So exhausted all the time and feel pain in all joints. Was hoping for miracle but did not get it.   ,2
"I received an injection 10/24/13Have had terrible headache ever since. I go to bed with them, wake up with them,have them all day. some so bad my imatrex only works for a very short time, then they are back. constipation is bad,yea I do have tom take a few other meds,also very sensitive to all meds, because I have Fibromyalgia for 25 yrs now. this is on my medical record  I can only get 9 pills a mo for my Migraines. Have heartburn every day, gastric pain.I have been miserable, cranky, go no where except to the doctors. Will see my pain specialist this week Hope she can help me for more then a couple days. God bless all that have been helped. I cannot believe I will have to live with this for six mos. Each day I get up hoping it will be a better day. ",1
I have had my 3rd injection of this drug with no side effects....I won't know if it is working until after the 4th injection when they do another bone scan.I took Fosamax and had horrible side effects so I an really hoping this drug is effective.,3
I have hip and leg pain so severe that I need pain medication every day. I've had three shots and will not have another.,5
I was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis and I just had my second injection of prolia and have not had any side effects. Before prolia I was on Boniva and had severe leg pain and esophagus problems because of it. I feel great since I've been on prolia and I highly recommend it.,4
have very bad dental problems with teeth cracking and braking easy. Ever since I started using medication almost two years now. need help to fix problem.,4
Have had my second injection and side effects for me have been TERRIBLE . First one  it lasted 3 wks . One week after second I can hardly get out  of bed . Last one for me . Feel as though I have SEVERE FLU,1
"3 weeks after getting the Prolia injection I started to feel leg pain which became unbearable.  This injection was prescribed by my endochronolist who thought this would be good for my iosteoporosis even though my bone density is normal.  I have leg pain with every step that I take. I have been to the emergency room twice.  All tests come back normal. I have been to a vascular specialist, tests came back normal. I am waiting to see a neurologist to see if there is anything that can be suggested.  Going for an MRI soon as well.  I have also seen a chiropractic but no help.  I pray that this medicine leave my body as soon as possible and I will NEVER EVER EVER take this ""medicine"" again and would not wish the constant pain that I am in on my worst enemy.",1
"My bone density dropped 8 percent in 2 years, just over the Osteopenia stage.  I was very disappointed since I am already doing everything to prevent this: no drinking/smoking, working out, attention to diet, take calcium.  I start Prolia next week to stabilize and increase density.  Will have another Dexa scan after 4 shots.  Praying for no side-effects.  I'm just now starting to really feel great!  I was on Femara for 1 year, Arimidex for almost 1 year now.",1
"FOLLOWING INJECTION, DEVELOPED MULTIPLE SKIN LESIONS (ABSCESSES) ON BUTTOX, GROIN AND ANAL AREAS.",3
Three weeks after receiving shot a rash appeared across the top of my breast. It gradually spread down to my pelvic bone and then around the sides to my back. Itch is terrible.I can't sleep when the itch is really bad. The bones in my arms hurt really bad. Have dizzy spells and fatigue is terrible. It has been almost 3 months since injection and I am still miserable. Will not take another shot of Prolia. It is now 2 a.m. Cannot sleep for itch and pain in arms.,1
"Have suffered numerous side effects:  muscle cramps, fatigue, soreness, and most recently a seizure.  I would advise against this medication--side effects are frightening.",1
Another update....I am still feeling great with no problems and I am due for my second Prolia injection on August 12th.I Will keep posting from time to time and if there are any changes!,3
"I have been charged $1500 by my doctor.  After being told by Prolia that my insurance would cover this drug, imagine my shock when a bill arrived for $1500.  Now fighting with my insurance company and it's one year later and still not resolved.  I would never have had this drug had I known the cost.  Why won't drug companies give you the facts instead of lying about what you will pay.  It seems to me that only Blythe Danner can afford it!  By the way, my T-Score is -3.5....well below the required -2.5 plus I was on Fosamax for years which did nothing.  I meet all the qualifications yet my insurance won't pay (Blue Cross/Blue Shield).  I was lied to by the drug company and now I must pay.  That's ridiculous - especially for a drug that we aren't even sure will work.",2
"I really don't know if this drug works but who can really afford it?   I had my first injection last October after the drug company that makes Prolia ""checked with my insurance"" and told me I would only have to pay $50.  Imagine my SHOCK when a bill came from my doctor the following January (2013) for $1500!!  Have been fighting back and forth ever since.  Had to cancel my second shot because I still haven't paid for the first one!  In my estimation, only Blythe Danner can afford it!   I won't be a guinea pig AND pay $3000 a year!  This has been a logistical nightmare and I'm still fighting to get it paid.  Oh, and my T-Score is -3.5   -   well BELOW the requirement so my bones are essentially crumbling.  Fosamax didn't help.  I can't understand why this is so ridiculously expensive.  I have recently gone on Medicare and am now told by the drug company that Medicare Part B pays for most of it - I would have to pay $150.  But I can't really believe them now!!",1
"This is the second time I have taken this.  The first time I had a severe headache for about 3 days straight. Did not take the second shot.  I let my doctor talk me into taking the shot again this year. Have had severe headaches, bone and joint pain, a feeling of lightheadedness, unable to sleep and rest at night.  Will not take this medicine again.",1
"I have a skin condition thought to be an auto-immune disease ,but MD felt it would be okay for prolia since I could no longer take oral. Prior to my 3rd injection I developed a few hives.( I had been taking plaquenil for my skin condition which is an anti-malaria drug)After injection my rash continued to get much worse, covered from neck to knees with raised,extremely itchy rash.  Plaquenil was thought to be the culprit and it was stopped. I continued to suffer with the rash and itching and a biopsy revealed yet another skin condition.  When I went for my 4th injection,I reviewd all of the above with the nurse practitioner. I received the 4th injection and now have lumps on my head which appeared almost overnight and have had a 3rd skin biopsy.  My improvement in my bone density has been minimal, so I will be stopping the prolia.I will be getting blood tests next week to determine if I have any auto-immune disease that is triggering the skin conditions,but will not re-start prolia. In my case the benefits DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS>",1
"One shot and I have had 3 upper respiratory infections, a strep infection of the ear, skin rash on ear, hip and leg pain, back pain.  I will never take the drug again.  Not worth the side effects.",1
I am about to have my 5th injection of Prolia. I have had no side effects from the injection and once I received the injection never think about it.  It's so easy and the 6 months just fly by.  My endocrinologist stated that I will be on Prolia for 5 years.  I have my bone density test in a few months and will report back my results.  Fosamax did not work for me.  ,5
"Had first injection 4/06/2013...no problems yet. Took Fosamax 5 yrs. and DECA results were the same...at least bone mass didn't get worse! My lower spine is -2.8, can't afford to get worse. Ellen08 and Mometter, please keep posting your results. So excited to see how Mometter has improved and can't wait to see how Ellen08 does. My next DECA is Oct.nof 2014.  ",3
Just an update....A little over 3 months since my first shot of Prolia and I am still feeling great! No side effects what so ever! I hope everyone has good luck with this drug!,3
"I have had 2 injections of Prolia.  Last month I begin to have pain in my upper right side along w/a dully ache, foggy feelings, arm pain, random headaches, fatigue, chills, and low back pain. I have had 3 rounds of blood tests, upper/lower CT scans, cardiac check up, etc. and nothing shows up.  I believe I am having multiple side effects from the Prolia shots.  I am due for another one and do not intend to take it for fear my symptoms will only get worse.  I have been an active person, going to the gym, eating healthy, and now I can't function at my previous level.  After reading the side effects that other people have had from taking these shots, I'm convinced that they are what is causing all of my discomfort.  No more shots for me!",2
Prolia may have helped my bone density.  However it gave me many side reactions: such as severe stomach and abdoman ache. leg crams and fatigue. I have to take several other medication to relief the pain. My  quality of life have been affected in a negative way. My advise is that do not take the injection if you have stomach or digestive problems.,3
"I had my 2nd Shot of Prolia , I felt a little off for a few days, which was ok, Then after that No side affects at all!! I work out at the Gym, 5-6 days a week since Feb.1st, I have have a personal trainer 3 days a week. I had my bone density In Jan 2013, I have now Reversed Osteoperosis, My Bone Density increased 10% I am SO Happy!! My spine is  totally normal, Osteopenia with a low T-score in my hips, Due to Lots of exercise, eating a lot of Kale, Green vegetables daily, Juicing daily, and New Chapter Organics  ""Bone Strength"" is amazing to. I feel awesome & I look forward to my next Prolia shot in July! This shot is easy & well tolerated & so happy I got it..  ",5
I have already written a review so this is an update. I had my first Prolia shot 6 months ago and my second one this week. My bone scan given the same day showed that I have already had a 3% increase in bone density.,5
"I am about to have my second injection today. It is too soon for results. They say wait 1 year to 18 months for results to show up on a scan. Hope I see improvement before that. The injection is painless with a tiny needle. I have mild scalp eczema which got worse and peaked at month 4 and had several minor eye infections as well. I wonder when people say their symptoms began the day after the injection as it takes a while for the drug to start working. My doc said that what it does starts slowly, peaks around 4 months then less and less, then it's gone. He believes my symptom were Prolia related as they followed that curve. It's not too much to bear to strengthen bones. Certainly some side effects are preferred over a broken back or hip!",3
"I have had many side effects from Prolia and my endocrinologist confirmed that they are side effects of this drug. A few participants in this forum stated that people would have experienced their medical problems even without taking Prolia, but I don't know how they are qualified to make this judgment. My side effects really kicked in after the fourth injection. Prolia lowers the immune system, so if you've had even the most occasional and minor infections, they can blow up out of control on Prolia. I now have chronic oral herpes, spreading acne, a kidney stone (first time ever), difficulty swallowing pills along with other muscle weaknesses, slow healing, and insomnia. I am on antiviral and antibiotic medications. I went from being a healthy person to this. A 6-month injection is dangerous because you can't back out. Those patients who feel well now may not feel so well after additional injections. My MD told me that Prolia was rejected by the FDA twice before it was approved. That should tell you something. I hope this medication is pulled from the market. And by the way, the endocrinologist I'm referring to is not the one who prescribed Prolia to me. I left that one because he didn't take my complaints seriously.",2
"I am about to have my 4th injection of Prolia.  I feel fabulous!! No side effects whatsoever.  I am a huge fan of Prolia.  I am very active, go to gym 4 times a week and one of the gals at the gym who is a young 84, has had her first injection of Prolia and it's been five months and she has had no side effects. I feel wonderful.  My endocrinologist told me that I will be on the injections for a five year period and then will have a break.  I believe that a number of people that are posting side effects have ailments that would have occurred even if they would not have taken the Prolia.     ",5
"Had my first Prolia injection 3 wks ago and have had extreme pain , flu like . Have been taking pain meds already + tylenol + iburprofen .Groin is hurting severely , not sure about effectiveness first injection . But barely able to move let alone exercise . Doc said give it 4 wks . Not sure i can handle next injection at all !!!!!!",1
"After having three of the prolia doses, I happened to pick up a flyer on it at my drug store. I noticed under the side effects that urinary track infection was listed. After the second dose, I had reoccuring urinary tract infections, which I hadn't had for years!!!  It has to be caused by the prolia. Also, when reading the other reviews, I noticed that one person had problems with balance. I have had this, too. But, didn't know what was causing it! I am due to see my bone doctor. I just spoke to his nurse. To change to a different type of medication, my insurance deductible will be $1,700 for the different drug! I will certainly have a frank discussion with the doctor! ",3
I will be getting my 4th injection of Prolia next month. My bone density showed improvement after one year of treatment with Prolia. I had tried and failed with many of the other osteoporosis treatments. I have had no side effects other than some nausea with my first injection which might not have been due to the Prolia.,5
"It seems that most people posting to this forum have not taken many Prolia injections. I have taken four. My warning is: the effects of this drug build up over time. You might start out feeling fine, but beware. Here's what happened to me: After my first injection, I had no side effects and was optimistic about this medication. After the second injection, I began coming down with colds and other minor ailments, a rarity for me. After the third injection, I began developing herpes sores in my mouth and insomnia. After the fourth injection, my oral herpes became extensive and chronic, requiring ongoing medication. I developed uncontrollable acne, also requiring medication. The insomnia continues. My mind doesn't seem as sharp and I don't heal as well as I usually do. My Graves Disease has become volatile after a long period of stability. I'm guessing that as more people take this drug in the longer term, Prolia side effects will become widespread. I hope this drug is eventually recalled.",3
"I need to make a decision whether or not to begin Prolia. I just finished chemo and radiation for breast cancer and now must take Arimidex (a hormone blocker)for 5 years (my immune system has already been compromised. My bone scan and dexascan show osteopenia and mild arthritis, I have a family history of osteoporosis, in fact my mom can no longer walk. I should have started this drug this week but have to delay because of dental issues and need a tooth extraction. My ONC said I will not be able to take Prolia for 6 months after the extraction because of possible risk of jaw osteonecrosis. I am very worried about taking Prolia at all, lots of people on this site seem to have severe issues. Anyone have teeth extracted while on this drug? Anyone else taking it because of Aromatase inhibitor?  I have also posted this under the reason heading:Aromatase Inhibitor -Drug Induced...",1

My bone scan and dexascan show osteopenia and mild arthritis, I have a family history of osteoporosis, in fact my mom can no longer walk.  I should have started this drug this week but have to delay because of dental issues and need a tooth extraction.  My ONC said I will not be able to take Prolia for 6 months after the extraction because of possible risk of jaw osteonecrosis. I am very worried about taking Prolia at all, lots of people on this site seem to have severe issues. Anyone have teeth extracted while on this drug? Anyone else taking it because of Aromatase inhibitor",2
"I just had my second shot and have had no negative effects from it at all. I took one dose of Fosimax and had severe heartburn and nausea. I decided that I was not taking any osteoporosis drugs since all of them seemed to be in the same class of drugs. I went without for a year and then I heard about Prolia. One simple injection every 6 months. How easy is that? No sitting around getting medication IV. No monthly injections and no pills that bother my stomach and have a long list of directions on how to take them. I feel sad for those who have listed terrible side effects but I wonder if all of their problems can be attributed to Prolia. One person said she felt like she had the flu but couldn't because she had the flu shot. She could have had the flu because flu shots don't always prevent you from getting it. Being overly tired, who isn't? After reading the negatives I feel fortunate that I can take this medication without negative side effects. I have had no muscle/joint pain and continue to do Zumba and Tai Chi.It is too soon to get another Dexascan but I can hardly wait. Thanks to Prolia I am finally able to do something about my Osteoporosis. I have already shrunk 2 inches and I don't want to shrink anymore. I have never had a broken bone and want to keep it that way. I live every day feeling happy that I am now able to do something to stop the progressive onslaught of Osteoporosis.",5
"I had a tough time with Prolia, but I am sensitive to a lot of medication.  Two month in after the injection, I could not move my hip.  I got an injection that helped.  The worst thing for me after Prolia injection is that my hair starting falling out, and my eyelashes fell out!  When they started coming back in, they are turning under, and I have to go to my Ophathamologist to have the eyelashes removed!",5
"I've had four Prolia injections and regret having taken this drug. The problems began creeping up on me until they got out of control after the fourth injection. I am prone to occasional herpes and acne, and now these infections are pronounced and chronic. I'm taking antiviral and antibiotic medications to control these conditions until the Prolia gets out of my system. I have other complaints about Prolia, too, for example insomnia. The problem is Prolia's effect on the immune system. If you tend to get any type of recurring infection, stay away from this drug. Don't forget, if you develop problems you can't back out of the drug because of the 6-month injection. The notion of giving an immune-lowering drug to older people whose immune systems are already diminished is irresponsible. I suspect, and hope, that this drug will eventually be pulled from the market as patient complaints become widespread.",3
My Mom had this shot twice and after the first shot she told her dr that it gave her flu like symptoms. Dr said that was not possible. After second shot the symptoms returned and she lost her appetite. Three weeks after prolia shot my Mom was hospitalized for severe infection and she passed away 2 days later. The doctors prescribing medications know very little about them and if my Moms dr had listened to her then she might still be here today. Beware of this drug!!!,1
"I just had a Dexa scan after 1 yr on Prolia.  My spine BMD improved 13.5%, slight improvement in hips.  Back pain has gone away.",5
Well now it has been about 5 weeks since my first shot of Prolia and I have to say I still feel fantastic. I have absolutely no problems with the drug. I was scared to death of this medication but I think I read too much online. I hope everyone has good luck with this medication.,3
"Pain after treatment was VERY unpleasant!  It has now been 15 months since I received Prolia and still have a rash on my legs, bad liver enzyme testing, and other difficulties which I didn't have prior to getting this ""stuff"".  NEVER AGAIN!  Please be aware of this and know that this drug is also used for chemotherapy--it's poison.  They won't tell you the truth about this drug you have to do the research yourself.",1
I had my 4th shot in october and I have never had any side effects. I had a bone scan last October and the results were much better. I like getting the shot and then not having to take anything else for 6  months. It is far better than Fosomax.,5
Have just had my 3rd injection of Prolia and have not had any side effects...feel good! I will have a bone density test done in October 2013 and will post my results. I now know a few people in my gym class that are now on Prolia and they have not had any side effects. I sure hope it continues as it is so easy to administer.  This site is most helpful. Good luck to all.,5
"After taking the injection started having extreme bone pain in hip and leg. It has been 7 months, leg pain is almost gone, but back pain continues. How long is prolia active?",1
I received my first shot of Prolia on 2/11/13 and truthfully was scared after reading all the negative about this drug. So far I have had absolutly no problems it being only 2 days but the truth is I feel great. I will post now and then to let everyone know if I have any side effects!,3
"I do not know if the drug has been effective since my first injection was Dec. 21, 2012. Within a few hours I began to feel like I had the flu. That lasted a few days and then the excruciating back ache set in.  That was followed by heaviness and burning in my legs and feet to the point where I could not even stand to wear socks. That lasted about 3 weeks and then I began to have earaches, nasal problems and a continual sore throat. My sense of smell seems to be impaired, also.  I will never have a second shot. My life has been miserable since the injection.  I have used other drugs for osteoporosis. (Boniva, Actonel and Foreto for two yrs). without any noticable side effects.  I have always had low blood pressure and now it is much higher.  As far as I am concerned, this drug is poison.",1
"I just received my 3rd shot.   I wish I hadn't.  I had not put together the few side effects I was having with this.   I have had small bumps on my scalp.  Sores pop up on my arms, tingling in my feet.   I have been so fatigued that I had my doctor run several tests.  I have just been told that I have an elevated ANA.   It is in the literature that this drug affects the autoimmune system.  I now have a clear picture what all these side effects meant.  My body is clearly fighting itself.   I will not get the next shot.   Do not know yet how effective it has been.   I get my bone density in October.  As a nurse and a patient, I do not recommend getting this drug.  S.W. Naples, FL",1
"Given 1st Prolia Inj.in Dec 2012 & w/in 2 days experienced Flu like symptoms, abdominal pain, headache, INTENSE ITCHING followed by a RASH similar to Chicken Pox..although bumps were not pustules, but they did scab over in the end. My immune system has been horribly affected & the itching and a red rash keeps re-appearing over different areas of my body. Two Cortisone Injections have NOT helped & nothing seems to alleviate the symptoms! I WILL NOT TAKE ANOTHER INJECTION!! I only pray this does not last for 6 months! I believe MUCH MORE study & evaluation needs to be done on this medication...Take heed BEFORE you get the Injection!! ",1
"Question on effectiveness rating of drug is pointless.  I won't know for a year.  One week post injection, I suddenly had a bone infection of the jaw causing an abscess.  Antibiotics for the abscess caused C-difficile.  As that was being treated, developed a lung infection. Throughout this period, skin was also very itchy.  Then shortly after that was diagnosed with shingles.  Then the C-diff returned.  Now it is a sinus infection.  Three months in and my immune system is effectively dead when I was completely healthy before.  During trials of this drug on multiple myeloma patients, twice as many patients died, so the drug was not approved for use.  There is a strong immune system connection that has not been fully explored.  I will not be trying this drug again.",1
My face broke out with pustules shortly having a prolia injection.  It started out with just one or two and now it looks like a severe case of acne.  I have been through 3 rounds of antibiotics and am using prescription topical ointment with no improvement.    Yesterday I started having severe pains in my right thigh.  I am due for my second injection in April.  I think I will skip it.,3
"easy, no side effects. I have had 4 injections. Last dexa showed normal hip bone, spine had significant gain. Maybe I won't crumble like my mother and grandmother.I take 4000 units of vitamin D a day and get 1000mg of calcium mainly through food. Vitamin d level is 54 up from 22!!!",5
"I tool Prolia for a one and half years. I noticed complexion problems within the first couple of months. Two places on my face had pimples on top of pimples. I had a bone density test a year and half after my first injection and was told no improvement. I made the decision to go off this shot. A few weeks after the time that I would have taken the next shot, I was in so much pain. My neck, my back, the backs of my knees, my finger, wrists, ankles. I could not sleep the pain got so bad. Twice I got down to pick something up and had to pull myself up. The pain has definitely lightened up but I now have intense pain occasionally in places I never had pain before taking the drug. Definitely not happy. ",1
I had my 3rd injection of Prolia   I did not feel well afterwards and my back started to hurt again.  I am taking motrin (800 mg) and put on a Thermapad to relieve the back pain but they are not working.  My back problems did improve in the last month or two probably because I was late (1 month) of getting the injection (insurance authorization). I feel as if I have the flu which I know is not the case because I had a flu shot.   The last bone scan I had after 6 months of my injection did show a slight improvement although not in the the lower lumbar region where the pain is.  I will not have a 4th injection.  The side effects are keeping me from my beloved exercise and golf and just daily things such as cleaning a floor or bathtub.  I am happy for the other reviewers that are giving this drug a 4 and 5 star review.  I so wanted this drug to not have the side effects but it is just not worth it.  I would rather shrink and be tiny than to go through this again.,3
"received first injection of Prolia in August, 2012. about one month later began to be extremely exhausted. it is now Jan.,2013 and i am not any better. also had tingling around mouth. some pain in groin area and have lost my appetite.  the extreme fatigue has just gotten worse. shortness of breath,heart racing, thought I was having heart trouble. had blood work and stress test with positive results. cardiologist suspects that all of these ailments are a reaction to the Prolia injection. am scheduled for second injection in Feb.,2013, but will not be taking it.  ",1
"Immediately after receiving the injection, I felt exhausted. This lasted for about a month. Then 2 or 3 months later, I began having terrible pain in my hip and lower back. It is so bad sometimes I can't sleep. I also have pain in my hips, making it hard to go for long walks. I am very active and never had any muscle pain at all before taking this. I am due for another injection next month, but don't know if I will get it. ",3
I have broken out with skin rash  which is on fire an itches terribly I will not be using prolia again,1
I just received my 2nd injection.  Only issue I've experienced was restless leg syndrome at night.  But I had also issues with this before starting this drug.  I do like the fact that you don't have to take a pill & only need to take once every 6 months.  Be sure to contact Prolia when you start to receive a discount card you can use against your prescription.,3
After my first injection of Prolia I thought this was the way to go.  Four months into the first injection I was having pain in my right hip and groin area but I thought it was just stress or something else.  Immediately after the second shot the pain went to the left leg. At times I can barely walk. I have had to give up most activities that I love.  I think that the cure is much worse than the disease!  I can't wait until this drug is out of my body.  I hope that there are no lasting side effects.  ,1
"I received my first injection two months ago.  Felt no side effects until a couple of weeks ago when I began feeling jaw pain.  My teeth and jaws are now sensitive to heat, cold and pressure upon chewing.  I have always had excellent teeth so this disturbs me greatly.  I have not had a bone density test since taking it so can't attest to the effectiveness.  I will discuss these issues with my oncologist at my next appointment in a few weeks, but am doubtful I will agree to continue with this treatment.",3
"My mother has gone through nothing but HELL ever since having this injection, from severe bone pain and aching, to swollen and inflamed hand, loss of sleep from the pain, irregular heart beat, etc.  Now she has no choice but to take prednisone on a regular basis until this GOD-awful drug is out of her system.  This drug should be taken of the market and a class-action lawsuit filed against the manufacturer.  She has contacted the FDA and the manufacturer, as recommended, and no one has the courtesy to reply.  Something needs to be done to help these unfortunate women who are experiencing these horrible side effects, as there seems to be nothing other than ""wait for it to get out of your system,"" as they suffer.",1
"I am about to have my 3rd injection of Prolia and have not had any side effects at all. The time has flown by so quickly. I'm very active, play tennis, golf, and go to my fitness classes three times weekly.  Took Fosamax for years with no benefit.  This is so much easier.  You have the injection and forget about it for 6 months.  I guess I am one of the fortunate ones!",5
"I'm 59 and was extremely healthy and active until my 1st shot on June 18.  After a few days experienced extreme fatigue and lethargy and the only thing I could attribute it to was the shot.  Coincidentally, a week after the shot, a drug Rep called me to see if I was having any side effects!  I reported my experience and we went through the ""documented"" side effects on the Prolia website together.  He suggested that I report it to my Doctor, which I did.  Now, 5 months later I've had a Urinary Tract Infection (never had one before), severe shoulder muscle and joint pain(have had 2 cortisone shots so far, and no relief), now I'm experiencing sever pain in my left elbow.  I've also had some stomach pain, but not sure it's from the drug.  I have always been healthy and active, these side-effects have negatively impacted my lifestyle, so I will report these to the FDA as suggested.  Although there are people who have no side-effects, that doesn't mean you won't get them...it's a calculated risk you take when you decide to get the shots.",1
"I took it Jan 20-, 2012, and I had problems with bladder infection for 65 days now, back pain, abdomina pain and had to be hospitalized for 2 days with chest pain, my cholesterol went up and now sugar, I will not do it again, I want this out of my system.. My tel# 254-338-2223 if someone had the same problems.",1
"Within 15 minutes felt migrane headache, tingling in face and feet, 45 minutes later Veritgo. Was admitted into hospital 2 days later kept thinging it would go away. My brain isn't working right all neoro damage couldn't walk still after a month on a walker, Doctors don't know when or if I will ever be right. I have to have 24 hr care still. Four specialist says it is this drug. I was working out in the gym prior and could speak and answer questions. Now I get confused and my ear by my Jaw has hurt for 3 weeks. Everyday is something new. My PT says it is like a stroke but all test show not. No one knows when this will get better. I tell everyone to stay away from this drug.  It should be pulled.  I am so angry and tired of these side effects. I just want to be they way I was prior. Don't take this I don't want anyone living this hell I am. I don't know when I will be able to go home. 30 days and counting. ",1
"My 84 year old diabetic mother, with one kidney, and taking prednisone was given a prolia shot in April 11th.  May 6th she had a seizures that put her in hospital for two months.  In September she had another seizure, but the hospital treated her for bladder infections.  She has had many bladder and urinary problems, to the point where she was sent home with a catheter.  She has since recovered her bladder control.  Now they have put her on Kepra, and I have to pay for 24 hr . care for her as she can no longer speak her thoughts properly.   The doctor tells me he has used this drug for years and NEVER had a problem.  Funny that the govt of ontario just approved it in February 2012.  This drug should be taken off the market.  Anyone in for a class action ?",1
"I have pain in my bones and a ugly rash all over my face, and I need more pain medication when I have the injection, and I feel like I have the flu for 6 months",1
Boniva infusions made no difference to my osteopenia or osteoporosis.  Took first Prolia injection 4 months ago - awoke in the middle of the night with excruciating spine and bone pain throughout my body.  Flu like symptoms - no fever.  Dr.'s diagnois is fibromyalgia - prescribed meds to inhibit pain receptors to brain - still have some pain and constant drug hangover.  Not sure I will take upcoming Prolia injection.  Has anyone else had this problem?,2
I only had 2 injections. The last bone scan after one injection showed indicated an improvement (below still below the normal range except in the lower back which remained the same.  I am happy for that.  At least it did not show even more bone loss there.  I still experience pain in the lower back.,3
"I just had my second shot of prolia.First 6 months was easy, but since having second shot have been having severe back pain, ringing in my ears and an overall feeling of tiredness.  Dr. said should get over problems in a couple of weeks.  If this continues don't know if I will take thrid shot.  Don't have any energy and lymphadema seems worse. Would like to know how to contact others taking this medication to learn of side affects of others and how long they lasted.",1
I have been taking this medication regularly for a year and a half following treatment for breast cancer.  I have no side effects.  This medication has not been found to cause many of the symptoms that others have reported here.  Possibly they are experiencing symptoms completely unrelated to this medication.,5
"My oncologist ordered Prolia due to chemotherapy related bone loss.  Had my first shot last Wednesday.  Almost immediately began having heart pounding,indigestion, and minor nausea.  Waited it out to see if I was imagining the symptoms.  When the symptoms did not subside a week later I called my doctor but she does not believe they are related. I trust her but I can tell something is different.  I'm going to follow up with my family physician so we might monitor what I am experiencing.  I will also keep a journal.  I know I will probably put off my second injection to see how I feel off the drug. I hope this drug is a good one but only time will tell for me.  I would like to know if anyone else has had these syptoms.  ",3
"I thought I entered this yesterday. My experience has been negative. My first Prolia shot was January 2012. Since then I have had pain/aching/stiffness in both arms. Am now in physical therapy 2-3X a week from ""frozen shoulders"". I caution others. ",1
"I had the Prolia Shot over 3 months ago, absolutely no side effects at all, My main concern was Prolia affecting my immune system, because of serious underlying issue.I took the risk, But it didn't affect me at all.I have a little low bak pain, but the gym helps so much & stretching.. My labs are excellent, i workout at the gym 4 times a week, i swim daily, I feel great !! I feel"" Staying active"" and ""strong mentally"" is the Key, keeping my self busy, I don't even think about it.. Im 51 and having fun!! Don't believe all the negative reviews,I truly believe Prolia is an amazingmedicine  & Looking forward to my next shot in Nov.Im a strong willed gal and continue to stay that way.. Thanks ",5
"I have been  thinking  I am dying and would like to go on record saying  this drug should be pulled off the market!!!!!!!  I have suffered intense back pain..my right arm and fingers are so messed up...the shortness of breath has me worried about a heart attack..i have been so weak I have trouble doing my housework...some one tell me when will this be out of my system  if ever!   Linda  sutton,  Cleveland,  ga.  ",1
"On January 26, 2012 I had the Prolia shot.  In February, I began having back problems, along with sciatica pain.  Twenty years ago, I suffered 2 herniated disks in my lower back (diagnosed with an MRI) and this pain now is just like that pain.  Following recovery 20 years ago, my back has been in remarkably good shape and I am in excellent health.  My last two bone density tests have shown no osteoporosis in my back and a slight bit of osteopenia in my hips.  I have had 21 physical therapy sessions so far and there has been some improvement in that I can now roll over in bed without excruciating pain, but walking seems to be getting worse.  I can sit in hard-backed chairs and lay on the floor on my back and be fairly comfortable, but when I stand and start to walk, I can take 20 to 25 steps and the pain down my leg gets bad and continues to get worse each step I take.  I can think of nothing that might have caused this pain, and then I remembered that one of the side effects of Prolia shots was the back pain.  I cannot think that would be this severe, but I do wonder if the Prolia could aggravate the back pain, and I'm hesitant to take the second shot.",1
I have now been diagnosed with adhesive capsulities (frozen shoulder) for both shoulders. The only thing I have done differently was taken a Prolia shot January 2012. I highly caution others before using this drug.,1
I now have a cracked tooth and 3 dentists are uncertain about removing it due to possiblity of not healing from Prolia. I keep having infections and need antibiotics to keep the pain in check.ONe DDS called Amgen.,3
"I am having my 2nd injection of Prolia and have not had any side effects from the injection - so easy!  I am one of the lucky ones as I was also aprehensive after reading some of the posts on here.  I am beginning to think that some of the reactions that others may be experiencing may have occured regardless of the Prolia injection and may not even be connected to the injection.I attended a seminar on osteoporosis recently and after reviewing all of the medications (by pharmacists), Prolia was touted as the drug with the least side effects.They had it classified as almost the same as the placebo. The clinic that I attend are doing a number of injections with no adverse effects.  ",5
After 2nd injection experienced horrible abd pain x3 days recurred 1 week later for 3 days. Testing notyet completed though.,1
"I am 50, I was recently diagnosed in January 2012 with Osteoperosis in my hip, Osteo-penia also.. I had the Prolia injection a week ago & I feel the best i have felt in a long time. No side affects at all!!  I was so scared to do the Prolia at first, Now i was worried over nothing! Excellent medication. By far the best of all available. I highly recommend Prolia. I feel like i am 40 again! ",5
I am about to receive my 2nd injection of Prolia and have not had any side effects. ,5
I had my first Prolia injection Dec. 2011 and will have my second June 2012.  I have had absolutely no side effects. It has been just like the flu shot - once you get it you don't think about it and life goes on.  Not like the Fosamax!! I was at a osteoporosis forum last weekend and Prolia side effects were very similar to placebo. I am glad that I had the injection but before I went ahead I did have some reservation like everyone. My clinic has now given a number of injections without any side effects.  ,5
Had my 2nd injection last week. No issues. Looking forward to my DXA scan next month. I was so nervous with the IV so its a relief to get a shot.,5
I've been on prolia for 18 months now and I have no side effects at all. Fosamax made me ill and it was inconvenient. This is so easy. I didn't like taking pills so often.,5
"I received my first injection last week and have had no side effects. The oral osteoporosis medcations I tried made my gastroesophageal reflus disease much worse even though I take Nexium daily. I am not post menopausal, but genetics and the Nexium have made me osteoporotic. So far, so good, I highly recommend this medication for those who cannot tolerate the orals.",5
"Caused serious side affects, Doctor never mentioned side affects, if I have known, I would not have agreed to have this injection. I have no osteporosis, just fractured my wrist.   It was only after Prolia has sent me a letter that the nurse told me to go to ER she feared I was having a stroke. Had cistitus, reflex acid, sore throat, very sore spine, rashes, lumps, itchiness, very hot and cold during night, not sleeping well, been over 6 months, have not received another injection, also had cat-scan for head, have water in the ear, the new bones growing over the old teeth and won't go away - dentist told me. Might lose a tooth.  Sore all over and very tired. This is a dangerous drug.  If it helped anyone, they must be very lucky.  ",1
I too was on Fosamax (Alendronate) five years with miniscule increase in T score. Had my first Prolia injection and absolutely no adverse reaction. The shot was painless. Cannot wait to see what results will be at next screening. Once a week vs once every six months..... no brainer,5
"I HAVE BEEN SO SICK AND LOOSING WEIGHT.  BAD APPETITE.  FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS,  THE WORSE THING IS THAT IT WILL STAY IN YOUR SYSTEM FOR 6 MONTHS",4
So far I am feeling better than I have in years. No side effects and I am currently in no pain.,5
I had my first injection of Prolia 3 weeks ago and so far so good...have not had any reaction whatsoever since the injection. The injection was painless.  I took Fosamax for years and it did nothing for me.  ,5
"Not really sure if it is a side effect of Prolia because I also started a thyroid medication at the same time.  I asked my doctor about that since it was one of the conditions in the warnings.  He said it was ok since I had mine removed.  I have had upper back pain, bladder infections, cholesterol jumped from 193 to 230.  I also develop ringing in my ears.  All could be coincidental after only one shot.  Leaning towards not taking another",2
just had my second shot last month. I've never had any side effects whatsoever. The shot is just under the skin so really doesn't hurt. Fosomax gave me rashes as well as other side effects. I am very happy with prolia and recommend it highly.,5
DO not listen to the other posters here who are most likely making stuff up trying to scare you. My sister is a physician and she went over all the side effects with me. The only real concern is a rash since Prolia does NOT go through the kidney or liver like all the other drugs. This is by FAR the SAFEST osteoporosis medicine. And its the easiest too. When looking at the side effects also look at how many people in the placebo group had. mostly the same. I hope that helps..,5
"I had my first injection of prolia three weeks ago, so far no side effects.  After reading the other review's I really hope I do not get the side effects other people discribed. The ease of taking prolia is as asset.",1
"Do not take this drug.  The side effects can be awful my mother has been hospitalized twice.  Bladder infection, bleeding ulcer, fluid around the heart,low sodium, and now pneumonia.",1
No more pills. No side effects and I paid nothing. Very happy.,4
"I got my first injection of Prolia in September of 2010 without much explanation from my doctor except that it was the next drug we could try to help with my osteoporosis.  Since my immune system has been compromised because of Lyme Disease, I asked him if this was a problem.  No, he said, just wash your hands more. Two-three months later, I felt awful. Back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, gas, acid reflux, etc.  I ended up in the ER with pancreatitis in November. By March I didn't need a heating pad for my backpain nor Vicodin for the pain anymore. My second injection was due March 30.  I again asked my doctor if my sympotoms could be caused by the Prolia; he said no.  Got the second injection and wish I never had.  Within days, the pain returned plus it was in my legs and toes as well.  I called my doctor; he said it wasn't the Prolia; take Advil and call my primary care doctor. I then went to the Prolia website and found that all my symptoms were side effects of the Prolia.  My chloesterol went from 186 to 233 in 6 mos., after just one dose of the Prolia.  If I had been given the proper information from the prescribing doctor before hand so I could make an educated decision, I would NOT have taken this new, just off the market Prolia medication. My primary care doctor, my GYN doctor, my gastro doctor, my allergist, and my general surgeon cannot believe my doctor would even think of putting me on such a new medication with my medical history of Lyme Disease and food/medication allergies.  We are all hoping by September the Prolia will be out of my system and I will have not any long term effects or damage.  Take it off the market, FDA.",1
What a relief. After my recalst infusion I had to take prescription pain meds to manage the back pain side effect. I had my 2nd Prolia injection 1 month ago. NO SIDE EFFECTS what a relief.,5
"Doctor did not advise of side effects, the worst ever, I don't think my life would ever be the same. Very sick the last six months, out of work for three months, multiple symptons,  nausea, root canal, blurred vision , skin lesions, leg, arm and back   pain, high blood pressure and heart problems, etc. ",1
"I had my first injection 3 months ago. I have had no side effects. I have no had another bone study so I honestly do not know ow effective this drug is. I know that the bisphosphonates turned me into a wreck! So far, I am a fan!",3
Severe leg/hip pain. Did not start until 2-3 mos after first injection.Pain is enough to keep from getting good nights sleep. Balance seems to be off. Due for next injection next month.Might forget it.,2
"Can't really say how effective yet. Received shot 2 months ago. It was easy to take but 3 weeks after getting shot, I started having muscle pain in upper thigh. Then, hip & knee began to hurt. I was walking 3 miles/day & now cannot walk without limping (no exercise for me). I feel it is very detrimental to my health to not exercise. I have severe pain day & night. So far pain is only on one side.",1
My mom was previously taking Actonel but complained of heartburn. She also didn't like the instructions for taking it either. Her doctor recommended Prolia which she was given in the office and only has to take two shots a year. She is so pleased with the ease of taking this drug. I feel good knowing she is getting a drug for her osteoporosis through her doctor and she really is taking it!,5
"Got my first Prolia shot about 3 weeks ago. Very easy as given in the doctor's office. Have had 3 instances of muscle cramps in my legs but blood test shows no low blood calcium. So is this a normal side effect of Prolia? If it builds bone, then the leg cramps are no big thing.",3
I have been very pleased with this medication. I only had to get a shot in the office and did not have any issues. I hated the idea of having to get infused or using a bisphosphonate because of the side effects. My doctor feels this is the drug of the future for treating osteoporosis.,5
"Pain worse than I've ever had, skin aged and leathery, constipation and can't breathe.  I'm in worse shape now than before I had prolia--will NOT take any more.  Stomach and digestion problems all the time, can't sleep.  6 months of hell for me.  Cholesterol went way up.  RA got worse--Dr. said it would help it--a lie! Dr. treated me as a guinea pig--used a sample she had in office--did NOT charge ins. for it.  She gave me NO info and now will NOT believe my problems are caused by prolia.  My back hurts worse than it ever did--I live this every day now--I hate my life since prolia--will not go back to that dr. I count the days til the 6 mo. are up, but I wonder if my body and life will ever be back to what it was or if there has been permanent damage or change in my body.  I've had RA for 8 yrs. and that is enough to deal with. I had a severe reaction to Embrel for RA and prolia is made by the same co.  So I don't think I should ever have been given prolia.  I have been an FDA statistic for both drugs now.     ",2
I have 1 and 1/2 bottles of promacta 50mg free to a good home.  My mom passed away from complications of CLL.  This drug is expensive and I don't want to throw it away.  Send your info to [email protected] ,5
"Recently finished hep C treatment, Peginterferon and Riboviren and Incivek, had a blood transfusion, hemoglobin down to 6.2, finished with that and was put on Promacta 25 mg daily. It has only been a week but have not had a nosebleed for 2 days. ",3
"With my 3rd relapse in Oct 2012 all treatments that worked in the past failed. Platelet count could not rise above 10,000. I was placed on 50mg daily of Promacta and immediately my platelet count rose to 97000.  The second week it went to 145,000 and 232,000 the third week.  Dosage was dropped to 25mg daily. Since then counts were 157,000 and 170,000.  My dissatisfaction comes from slight headaches, bad taste in mouth,low energy level, and interrupted sleep.  I am hoping that platelets stay high and with lowering the dose, some of this will subside.",5
was prescribed Promacta along with Rituxin - ended up in ER with blood clot in the liver.  Although no conclusive evidence clot was caused by either promacta or rituxin I feel one or both of these played a significant part in development of clot (and permanent damage to kidney).  Patients should be closely monitored by hematologist and all side effects looked into immediately!,1
"ITP for 62 yrs (diagnosed age 2); all previous therapy results, if effective at all, was short-lived (splenectomy, steroids, immune globulin, transfusions). Counts ranged from 9k - 32k prior to Promacta. Taking Promacta for 3 yrs. First time in my life that I'm not covered with painful bruises & petechiae! Counts stabilized @ 150k, started weaning, now down to 50mg once a week. Attempts to stop it results in severe drop (9k). Only inconvenience is working around dietary restriction. (Once a week? Please!) Once in awhile I have muscle pain the day after dose, but it's not intolerable. Cost is high, but beats alternatives (incl. Hep C therapy from blood transfusions, which is brutal). Insurance does cover for me. If cost an issue, perhaps you should contact drug company to see if help is available. If insurance is griping, remind them of the cost for hospitalizations, blood transfusions, etc. After all, Promacta is less expensive in the long run... Good luck & may all with ITP be blessed! Keep up the faith & good attitude - you can live with this! Side Note for Hep C sufferers: Promacta CAN help you get through course of therapy with Pegasys, I'm living proof! ",5
"I have been on Promacta for a while. Although it has helped, my biggest complaint is the cost of Promacta. And I am sure that I am not alone in this. When I was at my doctor's office I shared what I was going through financially. My doctor gave me a prescription discount card. When i redeemed it at the pharmacy, I was very happy with the amount of money it saved me. If anyone can benefit from this as well, please visit Medicationcoupons.com",3
Platelts went from 20000 to 156000 in 15 months,5
"If it weren't for Promacta, I don't know what I would do. It's been my 'silver bullet' against chronic ITP.   I highly recommend trying it if nothing else is working for you...of course, you should consult with your hematologist and be aware of all side effects before doing so.   I have had no side effects thus far, and it's been since April 2009. (8/18/2011)",5
"Started with 50 MG no difference in platelet count, next month platelets dropped, inceased mme to 75 MG  For the cost I expected miracles !!  1 mo supply of 50 mg  $6,422.36 1 mo supply of 75 mg $9,672.28",1
I have been on Promacta 50mg since Nov. 2010. Platelets range in the 85 to 125 range from 17. No side effects yet. Have monthly blood tests and all have been good. MUCH better than the Prednizone drugs and other meds the Dr. put me on.,4
I've been taking it for a month and it's working well but I've had a severe cold and extremely congested for two weeks.  I'm getting better but the doctor doesn't think it's related to promacta.  It's clearly disclosed as a possible side effect.,4
"My 17 yr.old son has been on Promacta for 2 yrs. Has had platelets range from 1,000 to 425,000 while on med. Average is 60-80,000. Whenever he gets slightest cold/illness his count severely drops, med doesn't seem effective then.",4
I too have lost the curl in my hair.  I have watery eyes my blood pressure has stayed the same a little high.  The real problem I have is the price I am on 75mg and it counts as 2 which is $160 a month,4
"I have been taking 50mg Promacta for about 3 weeks now and platelets have risen from 34 to 140.  So far, the only side effect I think is mild indigestion.",5
"it has kept my platelets at 90,000, but I have watery eyes, lost the curl in my hair, and my blood pressure has risen to 170/103. So now I take more blood pressure medication.  My ins co is not crazy about the price.  I am on 75 mg. I am now on 6 week intervals for blood work. I did have an eye bleed and the dr said I just broke a blood vessel.",5
I have only been on it one week and no side effects except back pain. I need the platelets raise for neck thyroid surgery.  I am wondering if certain foods can increase effectiveness or vitamins. I have now added steriods to up the drug..I hope...so far no increase... I am at 44 thousand now. I have had IUP for prob. 20 years.,2
"bleeding in the eye, chest pain, numbness in legs and hands, severe headache, nausea,and drainage of the eye.",4
This has helped me bet the platlet count to over 200 and keep it there It has been so easy and not have to go for a platlet drip each week as i had to do before the drug. Don't chew the pills. take it early in the morning and use coffee or tes to take it with it goes down easier that way,5
Treatment is okay.  Several hours in a chair not moving your arm.  ,3
I recieved provenge treatment before CA had spread.  (not approved for this) (Paid with my own funds).   PSA went from doubling every year to consistently going down.  Two years since treatement.   I am 59.,5
Have completed treatment 5 months ago..have some bone and muscle pain now.  Last PSA went up 3 points. Jury still out,1
No pain; psa is now stable.,5
This treatment worked for me.I do not think I would still be alive if I took chemo instead! I hope I can some day get a booster.,5
"I AM 56 YEARS OLD. FINISHED ALL 3 TREATMENTS. AFTER 5 MONTHS NO HELP WITH THE DRUG. ENDED UP IN A WHEEL CHAIR, BECAUSE LOSS OF MUSCLE. AM BACK ON CHEMO AND STARTING TO FEEL BETTER AFTER ALMOST A YEAR.",1
"I was very pleased with the Provenge treatment. Just sat in a chair for a few hours while my blood was taken and came back a few days later to receive Provenge via an IV, again sitting in a chair for a 2 or 3 hours. Had to repeat 2 more times for full course of treatment. I felt like I had a mild cold for a few hours but otherwise experienced no other side affects. So far it has been 8 months since I have received provenge and I am feeling better than I did before.  I highly recommend this compared to any other treatment in late stage prostate cancer. ",5
overall expierience was pretty good,1
I feel much better now and no side effects !!,5
medication has not slowed cancer.  Major side effect of muscle pain,1
"This is by far the worst medicine i ever used since having this disease. Since I started taking it i had multiple side effects, being exhausted was one, the other ones where heavy pain around the stomach area ,skin rash , brain fog and all my crohns complaints actually came back. Cramps, feeling constant ill and other issues.  Since I started taking this I noticed something changed my body didn't felt the same and the pain was killing me, how ever my specialist wanted me to keep using this terrible drug for over a month and I'm saying right here: if you got severe pain in your stomach area or liver stop the medicine at any cost, you most likely are ruining your liver/pancreas really bad! Which happened to me, your specialist will let you do blood tests every few weeks but listen to your body! I ended up in the hospital because i damaged my body pretty bad. Ask for entocort if you have light to medium crohn. Ask for prednisone medium to severe, when under control entocort. I'm saying this because most of the other medicines for this disease are total trash and not working at all, i been off it for a few days and i have been feeling better since ALIVE! The paper with the side effects are inaccurate and it's not 1-100/1-1000 people who get pancreastis or any liver issues due this medicine! It's so much higher i can just tell from the people I spoken with in the hospital and online! Becareful and for your loved ones pay attention!  If you have a medicine that does the trick and it's okay, be sure to have some spare, incase your specialist wants you on something ""better"". Hopefully it won't effect you like it did to me! ",1
"I started taking Purinethol after Crohn's disease diagnoses. The drug seemed effective as I wasn't experiencing much pain, however I can't be sure if it was directly related to the medication or not as I had just had my ileum removed (the main source of my pain and flare ups). Side effects of the medication was discolouration to my skin, so I went off it (unknown to my gastroenterologist). I have since been off the drug for 4 years and have not had a major flare up and very minor sensitivity. I chose an alternate route with a naturopath, and other alternative health care professionals. I am forever grateful. This has worked for me and has been very effective. I don't get flare ups, am a healthy weight, and am very happy. Taking the drug didn't sit right for me, that is why I seeked alternative help, even though my GastoE said there was no other option for me other than to take the medication. Just advising that there are other ways ",4
"I was taking it for Crohn's since 2001. It stopped my Uveitus attacks.  Please do research on this. I was just taking off.  I got a uveitus attack right away .  I now know I have osteoarthritis in my hands, knees, neck, wrists and back. The generic does not work. The brand has been removed from the market. Please bring it back.",5
"After taking this drug for approximately 25 years, the Mayo clinic tells me there is a very good chance that it was the cause of sever scare tissues in my lungs.  I also have a sever loss of  hearing--maybe the result  of the  chemo as well.  My doctors never warned me of these possibilities.  ",4
so i have been on this medication since i was 18. now im 26. i rading reviews about this medication and having kids ..... the side effects of it. does anyone know if i stop taking this medication for the time of the pregnancy is there still side effects ?,5
"I had severe crohns disease for 20 years and had 2 resecction surgeries. after a month of taking Puri-Nethol I was in hospital with pancreatitis. I spent 11 day in intensive care and 6 MONTHS in hospital. I could not eat for all of those 6 months. I was very very sick and was told i had a 1 in 4 mortality rate. Before I went into hospital I had night sweats and bloating so i was not told by doctors what to look out for. I would reccomend that you take this drug with EXTREME caution. While i was in hospital i got a blood clot in my neck, i got septicemia after they put in a biliary stent, i got fluid on the lung, i had blackouts from not eating and lost 5 and half stone in weight. I cna easily this was the worst time of my life. and a week after i returned from hospital my husband told me our marriage was over. so this drug took everything from me.  I am off most medicines and the only drugs i take now are zydol to help with regularity and creon for the pancreas so pleses make sure and keep an eye on any side effects no matter how small. it could save your life.",1
"I have autoimmune hepatitis. Because I was allergic to Imuran and its generic, I was given Mercaptopurine and have been on it for 3+ years after taking prednisone for 4 months.  It has worked wonderfully with few side effects.  However, I have started having trouble with urinary tract infections.  Over the three years, from having 1 to 2 a year, this year I have had 4--the last 2 coming within 8 wks of each other.  I was taking Bactrim's generic and it became ineffective.  With the urinary infection, I have terrible abdominal and back pain, swelling, trouble urinating, burning, and fever for about 2 days. I have stopped the mercaptopurine to see if it is causing that problem, despite my Dr's objection.  Does anyone else have this problem with this drug? ",5
"I am taking 50mg of purinethol per day also 25mg prednisolne, I am experiencing not so much dizzy ,but feeling like I am in a goldfish bowl looking out. I get hot flushes & sometimes my heart seems to race. ",5
"It caused Pancreatitus for me. Most pain I've ever been in. 1week in hospital trying to figure out. Temp of 103, very rapid heartrate, severe hydration and another week in different hosp where they finally figured it out. Wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",1
"While this drug has helped me with my colitis for the most part, my Dr. did not warn me ahead of time that I cannot come off of it.  Also my specialist never told me the birth defects and harm that could happen if I get pregnant.  I am 33 and want children and just learned from my main Dr. that if I get pregnant while on th is drug the child willmost likely have severe birth defects.  Now I don't know what to do and what medication to take going forward.  I wish my speicialist would have covered this information prior to me ever starting this medication.  It will be a sad day if I learn I cannot have children because of this drug.  Also, I have had to closely monitor my blood levels and have walked a fine line with having the dosage high enough to work but low enough so my white blood cells and hemoglobin don't go too low.  It has been really tricky but usually 2 tablets a day is best for me but sometimes they force me to drop to 1.5/day which usually means my colitis symptoms will start to come back.",4

"I have had ulcerative colitis for over 20 years now, and since I started a daily regimen of purinethol my flare ups have subsided. I take asacol two times a day and a multi vitamin and purinethol once daily. i am afraid of the side effects, but the positive lifestyle changes have warranted the possible side effects in the future. with exercise and consistency in taking my meds, i have limited the episodes of flare ups to minor ones every six months or so (non hospital stays). Good luck to all who have inflammatory bowel diseases, they are no fun!!",5

"I was first prescribed this to be given once every other day per manufacturer's recommendation. When that was changed to every day, my doctor recommended I go to one injection everyday to improve effectiveness. I have had chronic lower abdominal pain since having a colon resection 4 years ago. After my morning injection of Realistor, I have a bowel movement about 50% of the time but with a high price. It causes severe cramping for about an hour after the movement. I think my chronic pain being in the area of my remaining colon may be the reason for the cramping after movement. I also take 1 Linzess every morning. The Realistor is not perfect but it provides best results for me so far.",3
"I had been on Methadone 20mg every 12 hrs plus Dilaudid 2mgs every 6hrs for chronic pain due to severe nerve damage after 3 TKR's (Total Knee Replacements)... the Dr.'s had tried all different kinds of medication to relive the constipation that comes with being on opiates inc. Linzess 290mgs q12hrs and Amitiza 24mcg q8hrs without much success.. then the Dr.'s recommended Relistor 12mgs/.6ml every other day and I gotta tell you this stuff works within 15min of the injection, but not without SEVERE abd. cramps (like glass in my intestines!), nausea ",5
Been on high dose methadone for 1p yrs for severe back pain. Tried everything else available with minimal results.Works within 30 mins every time cramping occurs and may last up to one hr.

"did not work at all, took linzze didnt work either.",1
"I have been using this drug in conjunction with high doses of Miralax for years and my experience has been that after taking the injection one of four things occur: #1) nothing happens. #2) I have a bowel movement anywhere from very small to full cleansing with mild symptoms (cramping, nausea, headache) that resolve within 3 hours. #3) I have BM with SEVERE flu-like symptoms as above but include vomiting weakness sweating/chills shaking, feverish.  Symptoms resolve in 5-8 hours. #4) I will have any of the first three reactions but additionally the medication ABRUPTLY blocks the absorption of my pain medications resulting in SEVERE withdrawal symptoms (and increased pain) which lasts for 3 - 5 days.  It is awful! The drug manufacturer claims that this cannot happen but trust me and my doctors - I am proof that IT CAN (although it's probably not common)! The last reaction is a very high price to pay and which one of the four results that will occur is extremely unpredictable but when it works it's great! Sadly I am finding that the longer I am on it the more frequently I experience result #4.",3
"Having had 5 back surgery's and a spinal hematoma that left me temporarily paralyzed from the waist down in Feb '13 I have been on high doses of opiates for many years and have had years of problems with opiate induced constipation.  I found this drug the first med to finally help with that problem.   In approx 20 min. it induces a BM that totally cleans me out.  The doctor had me on fiber pills that were negatively impacting the effectiveness of this med, but when I took myself off the fiber, this med once again started working quite effedtivly.  Resilitor is the only med I have tried that has truly been effective for this problem and it has been a real life safer for me.  I don't know what I would do now without it.",4
"I have been using this for over a year. I have had to take it every two days leading to every other day. Recently I have had severe vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal cramps and dry heaving leading to dehydration resulting in a visit to the ER.

Day 7...injection site rash and mild headache.  Days 8-11....continued rash and worsening headache to the point that low lights and sounds caused pain to the point of wanting my constipation and back pain combined over Relistor. Day 12...permanent discontinuation. Day 13 and 14... headache vanished and injection site rash improving. Can't wait to see prescribing MD in 10 days.

"I've been on high dose pain meds since 2001 and knew I had constipation as a side effect, but it wasn't until I was able to lose a large amount of weight that I realized just how backed up and bloated I was. I heard of this medication online and asked my pain management Dr for it. He had no issues giving it to me. It took me a couple weeks to get the nerve to try it because of the side effects I've read, but I've not had any. This medication has been a godsend! It was recommended to use a laxative prior to help clean things out some, which decreases cramping from your body trying so hard to deficate. I now look forward to my injection every other day! I only need to go every other day because it works so well.",5
"Without relestor,Iwas unable to have a BM as a result of a spinal injury. I had lost all muscle control.My painmanagement md prescribed these for me. It usually takes about anhour.

Its great. I use it every day along with Amitiza and generic stool softeners.  I do not go every day but usually every other day.  Only problem so far is sometimes it gives me the runs non stop.

"After years of constipation and always feeling bloated and not wanting to eat as I should, I came upon this med by accident.  It is a miracle.  I will be on pain meds because of back surgeries probably for the rest of my life.  I do take sennokot S and miralax with it and I use Relistor daily to avoid any slowing of the smooth muscle of my intestine.  It works for me in 10-15 minutes.  My physician sees no reason not to use it every day since there is no risk of dependency unlike strong stimulant laxatives. With chronic back pain, being constipated is one less problem I now deal with.  This should be offered to EVERY patient who takes opiates, rather than having to depend on laxatives which may or may not work and which will cause cramping. Loose stools is the least of my concerns.",5
Relistor was injected in me in hospital for severe constipation. It worked very well but the following 2 days gave me pain in stomach. What can I do?,5
I am an RN for Hospice and want to learn about this drug.,3
"After 5 years of SEVERE constipation that eventually lead to regular bouts of migraines and vomiting, some lasting 2-3 days. Finally, after being correctly diagnosed by a GI MD from the University of Louisville medical school. I was treated conservatively--laxatives, stool softeners, huge doses of natural fiber, etc.--with little effect.    The application requires injections into the thighs; however, as a diabetic, I'm used to administering Rx via hypodermic needles. Although it can be slightly uncomfortable at times, compared to the fissure- and hemorrhoid-inducing stools and 1.5-hour long trips to the bathroom, which also exacerbate my back spasms and pain, the pain of the shot is nothing to worry about.   It is highly recommended that you maintain the use of stool softeners because you may be able to use the injections every 3rd or even 4th day, an important consideration given the expense of this medication. You will have to test its effectiveness on your own. This is a wonder drug if you've suffered the type of constipation described by me and others who require the use of large doses of opiate-based pain medications to live a somewhat normal life. Relistor works extremely well if you can afford it and get a proper diagnosis. ",5
"I have severe pelvic adhesions. Was doing 2-3hrs of enemas a day. Now do 1 shot 12mg/.6ml every other day. I use Equate (Walmart) stool softener & suppositories.

Started taking this drug in June 2009. You never know if it will work in 5 minutes or 1 day. I move around to get it to work faster.  My hair is getting brittle. Is this one of the side effects? Not sure. This just came up 2 days ago. I tap the needle since it hurts so much. I don't just keep pushing the syringe. If you stop & go I can tolerate it much better. If I take the shot & am having trouble, I use suppositories. They help.",5
"Today was my first experience with Relistor after 3 days of no bowel movements whatsoever. Due to chronic abdominal pain as a result of end-stage live disease and AIDS, I finally caved and went the opioid pain reliever route.  At first, I was prescribed Lactulose and Amitiza, but they seemed to ""poop out"" (couldn't help it-LOL) and became ineffective.  So, 8mg injection this morning around 11:30 and no effect yet and it's 6:30pm.  I do have a MAD headache and horrible pain now in my lower back.  I will try perhaps a stool softener and hopefully things will start to happen.  ",2
"I take 4mg injection after 5 days of no bowel movement. Took 3 hrs to complete objective. Some crapping and general discomfort, vomiting,completly exhausted,headache but it worked. I ate a light dinner, cereal for breakfast. Start the whole thing again, only this time I'll do a dose tomorrow.",5
"The Relistor did work after the 2nd injection; however, it was not getting everything out as planned. Also, I had to stay on the stool softeners in order to get the most effective treatment; otherwise, the brick-like consistency was not going away. However, since I was vomiting as a result of the severity and quantity of the constipation, anything that helped create bowel movements was needed and appreciated. I suspect that I need to be on a regular dose for this to work as it should.",4
"I suffer from chronic pain and have been on and off opioid therapy for much of my adult life.  Constipation is a painful side effect for most people, but because I suffer from chronic pelvic pain, constipation is extremely painful for me.  Unfortunately natural and/or gentle laxatives were not strong enough for me, and strong laxatives were too hard on my system, so nothing was working for me… until now.  Although it is too soon to say for certain, it appears that Relistor has answered many of my prayers.  I have just started the treatments and so I am just taking a little less than the 4 ml dose, and am only taking it twice a week.  But so far, each time I have had my shot, I have had a ‘normal’ bowel movement within one hour afterwards.  The down side, is that I am deathly afraid of needles.  But if it continues to work, it is a fear I will overcome.  As far as shots go - it is a thin needle and the kits come with great a little disposable, retractable needle and vial that makes it very easy to administer... unless… like me…  you are a baby with needles!    Of course I am worried as Relistor is so new, and I am worried about whether this is a long term solution.  I am very eager to see continued research as it is shared with us.  Ultimately, I wish I did not need the pain meds, and then I wouldn't need the Relistor.  But unfortunately, right now that is not an option for me.  So until my medical team comes up with a better solution, I have found a way for my stomach to be able to tolerate the pain meds.    Overall, if you are struggling with constipation as a result of pain medications, this very well could be the solution for you... it has been for me. ~Chronic Pelvic Pain Sufferer",5
"The intended use stated in the pt handout, PDR and online is misleading and could cause some pts to refuse the tx. I have a pt hospitalized now with Ogilvie's Syndrome that took some convincing and explaining off-label use of meds. There are many other conditions this is used to treat but in todays environment with this pork-barrel ""War on Drugs"", just to mention narcotics causes most patients to refuse the meds for fear of being looked upon as a ""drug user"" or after they hear the word narcotic, all they know is addiction. Considering most pts are elderly, after all the brainwashing by the FDA, mention narcotic, their almost autotomic response is NO! I'd suggest making it clear to your patients what off-label use of these drugs means and why it says narcotics. This pts idea of heavy narcotic use if 5mg OxyIR bid, and she feels guilty if she takes one at night because ""she had one that morning"". This is with a broken elbow implant, terrible cramps and pain from gastric problems, an NG tube, multiple IVs, the dr gives her 1000mg Tylenol for pain, once gave her Toradol/Tylenol, but she's afraid she's becoming addicted because ""they started me on this medication because they said I take narcotics and that's why I'm sick"". This is ridiculous-too many reasons for peristolosis interference other than narcotic usage. Come on Wyeth, you paid enough to get the FDA to fast track it in March instead of the usual seven year research, surely you can come up with better indications for usage! Really disappointed in Wyeth-but then again, they've already made their money back from Medicare Part D (the retail cost went up 300%)!",3
"I was prescribed Revlimid lenalidomide 25mg in combinattion with dexamethasone. The course of treatment was quite long and painful but I felt excellent feeling after a years. The side effect were manifested to a much lesser extent than his. I won a few years of my life. Thanks to this drugmake! However, it was expensive too so i took generic lenalidomide from ""medixocentre.com"" which was really quite very affordable and with same effectiveness as Revlimid. I want to say thanks both of him.",5

"I have been on Revlimid for about 2 years and the result is my cancer has been at a low level and controlled. I have no side effects that I am aware of.

"Was diagnosed with multiple myeloma 11/16. Was immediately started on Revlimid, on 3 weeks, off 1 week. and Dexamethasone, 5- 4 gm. once a week. I had no side effects from the Revlimid except a metalic taste in my mouth, but had to stop the  Dexamethasone after the 1st month because of rapid and skipping heart rate.  As I also have AFib I felt that this could bring on an AFib episode. I was put on Prednisone, 3- 10 gm. once a week. Except for not being to sleep on the night I take this medicine I have not had any side effects.  In two weeks I will be receiving Zoledronic Acid infusions once a month.  I also take Toprol XL 50mg and aspirin 325 daily.",4
"doctor used this for my mother who he stated had MDS without the syndrome.  All her blood levels would drop so drastically to critical points.  Then she would be taken off the medication and given blood stimulating injection.  Her blood levels would climb to just a somewhat acceptable level.  The doctor would put her back on the Revlimid, and her blood levels would bottom out again.  He repeated this bottoming and recovering process for about 10 months.  Finally, my dear mother could not recover.  She ended up with just about all the side effects of this medication and died.  We must remember that this medication is a chemo drug and will lower all blood levels in the body.  ",1

" [04-08-2011] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing the public that we are aware of results from clinical trials conducted inside and outside the United States that found that patients treated with Revlimid (lenalidomide) may be at an increased risk of developing new types of cancer compared to patients who did not take the drug.   FDA is currently reviewing all available information on this potential risk and will communicate any new recommendations once it has completed its review.   At this time, FDA recommends that patients continue their Revlimid treatment as prescribed by their healthcare provider.    The benefits and the risks of Revlimid should be carefully weighed when prescribing this drug. Healthcare professionals should be aware that Revlimid may increase the risk of developing another type of cancer.   Revlimid is used to treat a type of blood disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome. Revlimid is also used along with other drugs to treat people with the cancer known as multiple myeloma.   Additional Information for Patients and Caregivers   Do not stop taking Revlimid without talking to your healthcare professional. Discuss any questions or concerns about Revlimid with your healthcare professional. Continue to report any side effects you experience to the FDA MedWatch program using the information in the “Contact Us” box at the bottom of the page.    Additional Information for Healthcare Professionals  Preliminary data derived from evaluation of outcomes after longer-term exposure to Revlimid and from controlled clinical trials conducted inside and outside the Unites States shows an increased incidence of some second primary malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-cell lymphoma malignancies, when compared to controls. Since lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide, FDA is also currently reviewing all available information on this potential risk for thalidomide. At this time, there is no recommendation to ",2

I completed two cycles of Revlimid (25mg) and Dex (40mg at 10x4mg) before stopping all drugs three weeks before going to UAMS L'Rock, AR for stem cell harvesting in April 2009.  Took no drugs from May 2009-Oct 2009 when at that time I had a tandem stem cell transplant procedure at UAMS.  As a follow-up to my stem cell transplants, I as put on a daily (every day, w/no days off) regiment of Revlimid 15mg as a maintenance drug  and have been on it daily, ever since.  I have had minimal side effects: occasional feeling of being extra tired, infrequent muscle twitching (leg), some muscle cramps (usually resolved w/a Potassium supplement).  The daily Rev seems to be working, but the financial cost is huge!  My annual out of pocket cost, even with Rx insurance, will be in the neighborhood of 12,000 USD.  In the scheme of things, I suppose it is a small price to pay for another year of life.  Still, I would like to see the cost of Revlimid reduced significantly, not only for me, but more so for others who have less of an ability to pay and need to take Revlimid for their MM. ",4

"My father, diagnosed w/ myeloma in Oct 2008 and the cancer mestatsized after radiation and he's been on the drug since 09/09 (21 days on 7 off). The doctor says that his blood count is WNL however it seems as if the side effects of the cocktail (decadron and revlimid) have taken effect.  His legs, ankles, feet and face are severly swollen and he seems to be aggitated all the time. It's difficult to determine if the meds are causing him fatigue (he can fall asleep anywhere, anytime). Additionally, he has type2 diabetes and the cocktail has been known to increase blood sugar and effect kidney function although his proteins have been only slightly elevated. His skin is VERY dry so you would think he's dehydrated but because of the effects on the kidneys, he's constantly urinating. It is understood that this is not a cure all to the disease and some days are going to be worse than others but I wonder if he would have benefitted from infusions rather than the oral treatment. Yet, I remain hopeful that this will go into remission and the happy, on-the-go father I know and love will be up and about soon.

Until recently it has been search for something that worked for me without intolerable side effects. Early in treatment we found something that worked very well but side effects were not good so we kept searching. I tried everything but nothing worked to relieve pain and the usual other symptoms. We tried Rituxan and wish I had not. After the 6 hour infusion tiredness was the first symptom later that evening, the next day extreme exhaustion sleeping around the clock. On day 3 sleeping but like sinking into blackness like anesthesia before surgery, slept for about 18 hours. on day 4 I barely knew my own name and memory was almost non existent. I had enough of this so I had my wife call my DR.who then sent me to the ER. It took about a month to get the medication out of my system the whole time having fatigue and memory problems. I told my DR. that i was almost done with the RA meds , she asked me to try one more and i'm glad I did, it was Xeljanz and it started working very well from the start and it just keeps getting better. I actually thought Rituxan was either kill me or cause permanent damage. that **** took me places I never wanted to go.                                         ",1
"I had two injections.  Probably will not continue.  I have burning in my eyes, sore throat with fungus infection, constant flushing with red face. I am very tired.  Overall not feeling well.  Will talk to my rheumatologist about above, but I do not want to go through this again.  If anyone else is going through same, let me know by writing your review.",1
"I've had RA for 29 years. I have tried so many medications before rituxan. I had my first infusion yesterday. I was in a wheelchair, my husband dressed and bathed me. Just in 24 hours I showered and dressed myself this morning. I am slow still but I did everything without help. Didn't need my wheelchair, I put on my leg brace and grabbed my cane and walked into my orthopedic appointment today by myself. I still have pain but nothing like I had 24 hours ago. This drug helped me so much. Before my infusion my doctor gave me benadryl, Tylenol and steroids and I had no reactions. I was sleepy because of the benadryl which was fine cause I don't sleep much at night. I was very nervous about starting this medicine but I am so excited for my second dose in January. Well wishes to everyone. ",5
I was diagnosed with RA when I was 21 years old I also have lupus. I have suffered over 25 years with trying just about every arthritis drug there was when on disability when I was 48 just cannot work more. They found a rheumatologist Dr. Burke was I have had the Tuscan infusions for six years and I can't tell you the difference it has made my life I've gone back to school graduating with my bachelor's degree in behavioral science I plan on going back to work was enough for the Rituxan none of this would've been possible. So thank you very much for this drug although it's very expensive.,5
"I was diagnosed with RA when I was sixteen, so almost 21 years ago.  I have tried EVERYTHING. I have been on prednisone for over 6 years now.  The Remicade helped a lot, but quit working after a few years.  Rituxan is one of my last options.  I have severe migraines usually, and it seems that they have intensified on the medication.  I have had the two starting doses.  Between the migraines and severe nausea, I have been in bed most of the time.  Not sure if it is worth it.  Going to be talking to a neurologist to see if it is the Rituxan making it worse.  Does anyone else have these problems?  My RA is very severe.  I have been on disability now for 5 years.  I also take Tramadol and Phenegran to help, and I take Simvistantin for my migraines.  It just seems like I'm taking more and more medication when I was trying to take less.  So frustrating.  I am hoping the nausea will get better, and that my migraines will become manageable again because as of right now, I don't feel like I am even living.  One doctor told me that I would just have to choose between a life of pain or a life of medication with side effects.... VERY depressing news.",3
"I went into my first infusion with a little bit of problems, but the second dose was a little bit worse. I experienced major fatigue, whole body hurts and it's making it hard for me to function because of brain fog and it is hard to concentrate to do what I need to do in physical therapy. It has not been a week from my last dose so hopefully things get better over time. ",1
"I have stiffperson syndrome for approx. 10 yrs,. It is an autoimmune disease,1 in 1 million people can get, which affects muscle function. I use many other medications but Rituxan IV has relieved me of most pain for numerouse months for the past year.",5
"Although the medication has so far worked for me, I had a bad reaction during the 1st infusion with swollen face, forehead, hives, rash, and high blood pressure. The infusion had to be stopped and after treated with Benadryl, I was able to continue without side effects.",4
I have been on RITUXAN infusions for several years. This medicine is the only thing that keeps me walking.      THANK YOU RITUXAN  ,5
"I'm supposed to start retuximab within a couple of days and am somewhat nervous about starting treatment. I was misdiagnosed for 13 years with RA, then PA, before a biopsy finally confirmed Amyopathic Dermatomyosititis, but damage from so many years of uncontrolled inflammation caused a very rare side effect of Dystrophic Calcinosis Cutis.  I'm quite literally turning to stone as all my subcutaneous tissue is calcifying.  Was on Humira for years, then rheumy switched me to Embrel. Within 4 weeks of starting Embrel, the first lumps came. I now have over 1,000 lumps all over my body in every place that was chronically inflammed. I gotten blood poisoning twice from microscopic breaks in the skin which required 3 operations and 12 days in patient. I live on pain meds oxy & morphine, just to have a life. Fatigue is a huge problem, and so is walking. So many calcifications in my feet its like walking on glass shards. I don't know what the long term side effects of this drug can be and that worries me as its suspected Interferon/Ribavirin my have caused my husband death from liver cancer that metastasized to the bones. I have very little faith left in the medical establishment and don't trust doctors at all.  Do anyone know about any long term side effects of Retuximab infusion therapy? I'm 61 years old.",1
"I've tried Humira, Remicade, Orenica...several with no relief. Had my second dose of the first treatment with Rituxan last week and already feel a big improvement! However, like a few of you, I had a reaction with my first dose and after waiting and then slowing the drip had a better go of it. Here's hoping this one works!!",5
"I am about to receive my third treatment of Rituxan. On my first, I did have a reaction within 30 minutes of starting the first IV. They stopped the IV and waited about an hour until the symptoms disappeared and slowed the drip and I was fine. Rituxan is working for me! I have tried just about every biologic and I thank God that Rituxan is working on me and I feel like I do not have RA anymore!",5
"I had my first infusion three weeks ago for MS treatment. Had Tranverse Myelitis in 2006; recovered and now symptoms have returned and getting worse over past year and a half. Trouble with my left leg makes walking look labored and with a limp. I also have vision issues. Leg and vision issues become even more intensive when overheated or over-exhausted. I give it middle-of-the-road effectiveness and satisfaction because I won't have blood work for another four to five months to see how it's working. Rated ease at a ""3"" because of the scheduling, time off work, time for infusion, etc. After doing a great deal of research and reading reviews on every site possible, I was very nervous to begin treatment. I had no issues with the infusion. The Benedryl made me tired enough that I rested for most of the time and after I got home. Total time at infusion center was five hours, but that included getting prepped. I was told that since I'm using for MS treatment (and only receiving once every six months), they will treat me as a first-time patient each time; the risk still goes down for a reaction, but it's possible so they're careful. I appreciate that! 36 hours after infusion, my walking, leg mobility was NORMAL!! Was praising God for the miracle. When I woke on day 3, all symptoms had returned. Still praising God, but disappointed that I didn't have continued results. I'm hopeful that this med will keep symptoms from getting worse, but was cautioned not to expect improvement. ",3
"I have had RA for 27 years.  I was on embril for several years, but developed an alergey to it.  I have had 1 infusion of Ritoxan, and wish I had not let my Dr. talk me into it.  It has been 1 month since the 2 infusions and so far I have suffered from 2 bouts of horible mouth sores. Each listing about a week.  It is so bad that I am unable to open my mouth wide enough to eat.  I drink liquids through a straw, no solid foods.  So far I have lost 12 pounds (I was not over weight before) I am unable to sleep much because of the pain.   I have a medical card for Marihuana and that controled my pain better than any drug. ",1
"During treatment, I went into anaphylactic shock.",1
"My Dr. Put me on a two yr maintenance program with Rituxan. After a 6 month treatment with 4 drugs. My scans were looking good lymph nodes shrinking but then I developed a lung reaction, shortness of breath, etc. this is a very rare side affect from long term use. So I didn't get to finish out my 2 yrs and my Dr. Will never give me the drug again. Needless to say after 10 yrs and having been on 8 different chemo drugs , I have been allergic to 3. I start chemo again on May 15th, after 1 year of my last treatment. Praying for a cure or just a drug to keep it from coming back so soon. ",4
"Treatment for CIDP caught very early and RA after having it for 9 years. Day 1, surge of energy from the pre-steroids. No sickness or side effects. Day 8, felt that my RA was leaving my body. Joints were not swollen and pain was gone. Second Infusion same thing with the energy. I felt it immediately from the steroids. By day 8 I was missing the steroid effect a lot. I felt like my body was tired but not sleepy. My body rested without pain. By day 15, I started a little flare but kept to a min. Was really thinking that steroids were the best thing and missed them. (knows better.  All in all I am doing much better for RA. About CIPD, stairs are still really hard for me to do. Not for lack of energy but lack of muscles. I don't have the ooomph that I used to have but I am not feeling like my arms weigh 2000 lbs either anymore. My neuropathy is unaffected. It will be 2 years before we know if it made a difference. 2 doses and done is better than so many of the others. Best RA drug that I ever had. I only had TFN blockers before this one. Mayo Clinic Likes this one for CIDP so I am taking it. ",4
"Received first infusion of Rituxin as a first course of treatment for his CLL.  Treatments lasted one month.  All seemed to go well.  Now, one month later, he has a terrible body rash on back, stomach, arms & legs.  The rash is so red & itchy.  Oncologist suggests putting him on a Methylprednisolone for 21 days.  We shall see.",3
"I was diagnosed with low grade B cell lymphoma/ MALT type stage IV in Sept. 2014. Which started in stomache and now it is in both lungs. I've had 2nd round of Rituxan and not sure how o feel about it. Doctor and review I have read indicate that I shouldn't have side affects yet during first infusion I broke out in rash, meds took care of that yet I have leg pains tiredness andcontinuous headaches everyday. Tingling in hands, pain in chest area and back and sometimes with no energy. When I mention to the doctor and nurses they tell me the Rituxan does cause side affects! Well then is it just me, is it in my head, the Rituxan or the lymphoma that is causing all of these things. The nurse says some people even work full time while in this med?! What's wrong with me? Maybe someone can give me some feedback. Thanks",2
"I am 59 years old and have had RA for 20 years. My doctor put me on Remicade as soon as it was approved and mostly it worked pretty good. I have also tried Orencia, Humeria, Actemra, methotrexate - to no avail. I received my first dose of Rituxan almost two weeks ago. I had a severe reaction within 30 minutes of the administration of the IV. They stopped the IV, gave me oxygen and gave me a steroid shot. After symptoms subsided, they restarted the IV and I have been fine and feeling fine for almost two weeks. I get my second dose in 4 days. I am praying for good results, but a little scared at some of the things I have read here. As all you RA sufferers know, we would try almost anything to not suffer with pain and inflammation. I have been pretty fortunate that I always find something to get it under control, without resorting to daily doses of prednisone (hate that drug and refuse to take it daily). However, I have NEVER had a reaction to any infusion and did with Rituxan. Wishing you a life without pain!",4
I have had four treatments of infusion at hospital over around 6-7 hours including flushing over a period of one year. I am now in full remission and only taking 20mg Arava daily to stay pain and swelling free.,5
"Minimal side effects.  Tiredness for 48 hrs, bloating, constipation.",5
"2011 I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Dermatomyositis, interstitial lung disease, Asthma, Sjogrens and GERD. I have taken every RX available, biologics including Humira, Acthar and IVIG to no avail. On high doses of Prednisone orally and by IV at ER. My last chance drug is Rituximad. I have had two infusions two weeks apart. Second infusion great! First infusion scratchy throat- cold symptoms- given IV-Hydrocortisone and IV Benedryl - waited 30 minutes and finished infusion. RA pain in the AM has greatly subsided. Have few headaches, sensitive/itchy scalp, shell fish/fresh fruit allergy (itching). Had blisters in my mouth - bottom of feet sore. But really help with RA pain!!! I'm feeling better and cautiously more active. Can't venture out much because of immune system being extremely low with Rituximad, Prednisone and Azathiaprine meds. But feels god to get rid of some of the pain.",4
"I just finished my fourth infusion. One a week for four weeks.  Rituxan was given to me in this manner to treat for severe RA and Vacillitis.  The infusions went much smoother than I expected and although I am still tapering down from prednisone I feel like I have my life back.  I went from not being able to get out of bed and missing work at least twice a week to being able to go daily and do all the physical things I want to do. Not sure how much prednisone (still on 15mg daily) is playing a part of this relief and how much the Rituxan is.  The next few months will tell the whole story.  My only side effect has been some tingling in my hands, feet and lips. ",3
"Had my first treatment (infusion) yesterday for myositis.  It took approx. 5.5 hours from start to finish.  Had a reaction, severe itch that started in my ears and worked to my hairline.  Treatment immediately stopped and was given a high dose of Benadryl, treatment then resumed at the next lowest level.  No further complications.  Will have second treatment in two weeks.  Will follow up on that when it occurs.  Want to say JH Infusion Center was on the ball and top notch.  Had a lot of anxiety going in, but the staff was courteous, kind, and informative. ",3
Was on Methotrexate for almost 3.25 years. Switched to Rituxan after few flare-ups. So far gotten 2 infusions 2 weeks apart. One month after the second infusion - got community acquired pneumonia. Next infusion scheduled in 3 months. Hoping it goes smoothly without any infection coming!,4
"I had bad reaction to the infusion.  I experienced myalgia and arthralgia after the infusion.  I was told this would be temporary condition lasting a few months at most. It has now been 6 years and am still suffering.  I am in chronic pain and am taking narcotics.  According to my doctor when the reaction was reported, this was unheard of by the drug rep.  Deeper research has revealed that this probably happens in about 1 in 10,000 patients.  Lucky me.  My doctor was even unaware of this possible side effect.  The specialist at the NYU Joint center say they have seen too many cases similar to mine.  ",1
"Diagnosed 07/2004, at age 47 yrs old & began with Methotrexate & a lot of other meds; can't recall all of them now. I was on Humira Injections for 4.5 yrs & then it began to  stop working. Lab numbers began going up. So, the Rheumatologist began Orencia, only used 1.5 yrs, never really began to work. He then switched me to Rituxan. It began to work within 1 month, if not sooner. I have severe RA, I have used since 2.2011. Has been a wonderful change!! No side effects, take infusions every 16 (& 18 weeks). Thank you!!!",5
"I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that started in 2010, and continued to escalate from through 2013. I have a history of of CVID dating to 2005.   Symptoms are compatible with neurological form of Sjogren's -incapacitating fatigue, insidious small fiber neuropathy, GERD, and dryness of mouth and sinuses. I also developed chronic migraines starting 2010.  When high-dose IVIG failed to work for me I was administered Rituxan in August of 2013. I had 3 infusions, each a week apart.   I responded subtly within a week of the third infusion - as if a switch was turned on in my immune system. Within 6 weeks I was able to begin exercising and socializing for the first time in 2 years. I had been essentially housebound previously.   My energy went from a 1 to a 5-7 on average, my neuropathy went from a 10 to a 1, spiking to a 3/4 when I had a migraine (no change in those unfortunately).   The medication washed out after 6 months, and I have descended to 80% of my pre-Rituxan state within 4 weeks. I am currently awaiting a second round of Rituxan treatment.   I feel that with 6 month regular interval treatments I could live a ""normal life"". I have not worked full time, and barely at all, since 2010.  The consensus seems to be that response to Rituxan is either fantastic or not. For those with autoimmune diseases, success is dependent on whether your B cells are largely responsible for creating the antibodies attacking your immune system. As of yet, there is no test to quantify that. It's deduced from the response to the treatment itself.  Good luck to those reading this. I hope you (or your loved one) receives release from their suffering soon. ",5
"I am a 49 year old female who was diagnosed ten years ago with RA, Fibromyalgia, and Sjogren's disease. I also have type II diabetes,and high blood pressure. I had to quit my job as a teacher because of my conditions. I have been on disability for two years. I recently took two infusions of Rituxan two weeks apart. Each time, I took Benadryl and aspirin before the IV. The only side effect that I experienced was that my blood sugar went really high. My starting sugar was 170, by the end of the infusion it was up to 372. The second time, we didn't take a before reading, but my ending sugar was 575. Both times I took extra insulin and it went back to normal in about a day. I don't feel remarkably different. I am still experiencing pain in my wrists, hands and fingers, but my feet seem a little better. I take Lyrica and Cymbalta and Opana for pain daily. I still am experiencing bouts of severe fatigue, sleeping 15 or more hours a day usually for 2-3 days in a row. Rarely do I feel well--good days are few and far between. I have very little energy to do anything. I have had a few headaches since the infusion. I will not take any more Rituxan for six months. I was expecting more -- and I am surprised that I didn't have any major side effects, but I didn't have any major improvements either. Maybe it will kick in later, but it seems to me that if it was going to do anything for me, it would have done it by now. I don't know what I think about getting another infusion in six months. I have been on all the DMARDS and biologics; I was one one of the first people in my hospital to use Actemra and I tried and rejected Zeljanz before they even got their commercial on TV!! There aren't any more drugs for me to try unless some new ones get approved. I am scared to know what all of these drugs have done to my body.",3
With the side effects I was getting from the chemo I'm still getting from just the rituxan now.  It make me nauseous and very nerves. It was given once a week for the first two weeks after the cancer was gone.  It is too strong for me to be given once a week.  I will be getting my third infusion the 21st on November.  I will not stand for two weeks in a row again. It really messed up my daily doings.  Plus I am taking Paxel for anti-depression.  Not working. I was told I would have a total of  5 infusion of this stuff. Not sure I want the last three.,5
 treatment very unpleasant----all signs of cancer gone----(after 6 weeks)----remaining side effects very painful---shooting pains from hip to foot when sitting----continuing to the present (-3  months since last treatment.,5
"had a heart attack and needed a CAB open heart,found my platletts at 50,000 Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)because of my faith as a Jehovahs Witness and do not take whole blood transfusions they used steroids to raise blood count but it failed and caused poising to my system and needed hemo dialysis,with serveral attempt to talk me into blood transfusion and telling me I would die without it, they finally gave up and told me they could use retuxin 4 treatments a week apart... it has raised my platletts to over 196,000 and blood count is almost 14 and heacrit is 37.6 retuxin is working for this application, side info they did a bone marrow to rule out blood desease, and also my heart ventricals are 90%,80%,70%,30% blocked hopefully I am operated on in a few days, retuxin worked for platlett ploblems",5

I'd like 2 know about what effects it does 've on the Cardiac system....Thanks, camaciintyre-Ross",3
"Have had RR MS for 25 years. Within a week from the first dose i was walking without the cane! After the second, 2 weeks or so later, i am able to do things i couldn't do in years, like jumping. though it doesn't seem so important to be able to jump, it illustrate clearly my improvement. Might be too soon to say, but so far (3 weeks after i started) it has changed my life, something none of the other meds did for me (Avanex, Tysabri, IVIG etc).",5
Started 6/12 with rituxin and trianda  white count whent from 377k to 2k after first treatment. Mostly no problems form 12hrs a month for 6 mths except tired a lot and one bad night of extreme chills and vomiting. Subsequent have developed active hepb and shingles within 6 mths from last treatment. Other then that all blood counts are in line. May have nothing to do with. T h e drugs but I think so,2
This drug is the only thing that has helped me with my RA.  Only problems I've experienced with the infusion was some allergic reactions during the infusione that were corrected by decreasing the amount of the IV.  Also had some nausea for a couple of weeks.  The positives of this drug far out weigh the negatives.,5
"I had 6 cycles of R-CHOP, once every three weeks.  I have been on Rituxan now since November 2012, once every 2 months and will continue for 2 years.  My scans have been great and I have been in remission.  The IV takes a while, but it is very do-able!",5
What a difference!  It feels so good to be better after so many years!  4 treatments in a month - took alot of hours for treatments.  Lungs and kidneys are doing so much better.  Starting to get some energy back.,5
"I have had RA for over 30 years. Rituxan has allowed me to get my life back. My pain has been GREATLY reduced. I no longer have pain on a daily basis. I still have flare-ups but they are not as serious as before. I'm no longer a regular guest at the local hospital ER. I am free of my cane and walker. My depression is much better. I work part-time. I have a history of several joint operations, including joint replacement, but  that has decreased significantly. I do have side effects: nausea (first treatment for three months and lost 15 pounds), hair loss, headaches and seizures, but they have improved over time. I can't prove they were all caused by Rituxan but occurred simultaneously. Thanks, Rituxan, for GIVING MY LIFE BACK.",5
"The hardest part 4 me is the IV. I have tiny baby veins. Ater I get my treatment I notice a reduction in fatigue and an increase in ease of use of my arms and my mobility . My neuro told me it was ""not a cure"" so after deciding to try it I went in w/ no expectations(especially after years of DMD's that I felt no benefit from). I think because every ones MS is different the effects of drugs will be different, that being said I totally recommend it for an SP treatment.",5
"I have had RA for 36 yrs.  Enbrel was my number one choice but it faded out after 7 yrs.  Rituxan did great for 3 years, but now it, too, is losing its effectiveness, so my doctor suggested going up to 3 times/year instead of 2..yikes.  I just can't make myself do that because of the severe possible brain disease and other things.  I am on Orencia now but I don't think its going to do much.....maybe on to Humira.  ",4
"On February 13, 2004 my wife was being treated for Waldenstrom's with Rituxan IV. It was her first treatment. The doctor was warned of her history of allergies to many drugs and he decided to give her a double dose of benadryl. Approximately two hours after starting the treatment my wife died from an allergic reaction to Rituxan IV. I would not recommend Rituxan IV to or for anyone suffering from Waldenstrom's if they have a history of any type of allergy.",1
"This is not an ""easy"" choice for me. It is however about the only option available to me now as other treatments have failed. My reaction has been uneven. Sometimes I suffer side effects for 1-4 weeks and other times just a few days. Eventually I get relief but that also varies from a little to a lot. I look forward to a new alternative but until then, this is my best option.",4
"I had been on cytoxin IV for 4 years with side effects of cystitis, hematuria. After getting Rituxan IV I am able to do more activity as well as the triggers which caused my coughing episodes has almost ceased completely. My life went from living almost in a bubble to becoming active and able to be around the public somewhat. ",5
I am 73 with RA for 7 years. This is the fifth med I have been on. After my third treatment two months later I got a red ithcy rash. Round scaly spots on my arms and legs. RA Dr. said it is not Rituxin. He is treating me with prednisone. I am considering not taking anymore treatments.,3
"Will be taking my fourth round next week (6 treatments under my belt).  I have had RA for approx 20 yrs.  I have tried most everything available. Since the first treatment, I have come off of taking Tramadol for pain and Prednisone for inflamation. I have been very please with no side effects. I think you just have to try anything and everything until you find the right drug to help your body.",5
I have cryoglobulinemia and have been on Rituxan since 2011 every 12 weeks get one infusion per week for 2 weeks then on 12 break... This has worked so well that spleen has decreased in size and MRI of brain shows no more areas in the brain from low blood flood when abnormal protein would gel in blood vessels... It is keeping  me alive and so happy to finally found a treatment... although will never cure it...,5
have Cryoglobulinmia and have been on treatment since May 2011 get it every 12 weeks once a week for 2 weeks then get another 12 week break.. It has kept it in check ... the only probelem is finding hematologist to treat it... Went to one that said when I get large non healing sores on legs then come back.... by then I would have had major organ failure and would been of no use.... ,5
My husband has polymyositis which is a very rare autoimmune disease.  He had been treated with cortisone and methatrexate previously but the Rituxan infusion seems to bring him into remission of about 14 months.  He has had 2 other prior series of infusions with this drug. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has used it to treat polymyositis.,4
"My first infusion was on January 24, go for my second infusion on February 7th.  Hoping for good results",1
"I receive Rituxan every six months to keep my NMO (Devic's) in check. Since starting the treatments in April 2010 I haven't had a single exaserbation.  I wish I had started it sooner, I might still have eyesight in my left eye.",5
"I had 2 infusions - after the second one I noticed hair loss, it suppressed my immune system too much and got sick 5 times in 8 months with sinus infections etc.  After trying to boost immune system with pneunomia which didn't work.  I am now having to take IVIG glamuglobin treatment to boost my immune system.  As far as the RA it worked, but it screwed up my immune system.  Hope this review was helpful.  ",4
"I am a 49 year old awaiting a heart transplant. I have been on 1000mg of Rituxin every 2 weeks and IVIG two day a month for the last 9 months. The goal is to reduce my B cells in order to help prevent rejection. The process has been long and slow but effective. I have had very few side effects, mostly fatigue and headaches. I call it a Rituxin hangover that lasts for a day or two.",4
"My RA was diagnosed about 5 years ago after many years of intense pain. I have tried everything from mthx, Enbrel, Oerencia, etc. None have worked. 6 weeks ago had first infusion of Rituxan. Had to stop infusion because of severe itching in ears and throat started closing up. They gave me more benadryl and steroids and added fluids to the Rituxan to dilute it. Next day I had swelling of face, severe sensitivity to the sun with burning, fatigue and nausea. Next treatment the nurse started out with the dilution and benadryl and only 1/2 of steroid as doctor thought the day after photosensitivity was from the steroids administered the prior infusion. As soon as the iv to dilute ran out I began itching and swelling again. Spent the next week on benadryl to help with face swelling and burning. It has only been 7 weeks since then and I still have to take Ultram every day for the pain and Arava. Very fatigued still but a decrease in morning stiffness and ability to get it going. Don't know if one positive outweighs the negatives yet. Even a small relief is perhaps better than none at all. Ultram takes a really long time to start working too and have to take 2 at a time for relief. It is good to know others are running into the same roadblocks. Helps with the frustration and depression.",3
I was taken off Tysabri after 50 doses and tsting positive for the JC virus.  From last December until my firs dose of rituxan in May I was barely waking with my rollator.  I still use my walker but can walk further with it now.  I would say it got me back to the level I was on with tysabri.,1
I have few other issures so i am not sure if it work totaly,3
I was diagnosed with RA 1 yr ago. Prednisone was the only drug that gave me relief. I had 2 rounds of Rituxan 4 weeks ago & am still waiting for relief from the terrible pain in my knees & hips. I hope it kicks in soon!,2
"I have a pretty erosive form of RA with very high CRPs, RA factors, and sed rates when I was diagnosed 4 years ago.  I tried Enbrel and Orencia with no improvement.  I have been on Rituxan for nearly 3 years and now I sometimes forget I have RA.  I get the itching throat reaction during the 1st infusion but not during the second.  I feel a bit weak for the 1st few days but I have no side effects after. I don't take any steroids, pain meds, or any other drugs.   This drug has been a miracle for me!",5
"This drug worked for me. I took it the r chop combo for six cycles. I am now taking it every twelve weeks for maintenance. The down fall is the fatigue, weight gain and joint aches. This drug helped me tons!! I am a 30 year old survivor.",4
"I was diagnosed with stage IV follicular lymphoma in January 2010 (2 years ago). I began with an initial treatment of floudarabin and rituxin simultaneously and I have continued to receive rituxin alone in 4 weekly treatments every six months. After one treatment a PET scan showed greatly reduced cancer cells throughout my body and after a year my bone marrow was nearly clear. I feel good physically and am as active as ever. During my first rituxin infusion I suffered from swollen throat, difficulty breathing, and some paralysis of my mouth.  The nurse slowed down the drip and gave me additional benadryl and we made it through, though the process took about ten hours.  Since then I have had no difficulties or side effects from rituxin  until just recently. During my most recent series I developed persistent sores on the sides of my mouth.  I will talk to my oncologist about them but I believe this is a standard side effect. ",5
"I was prepared right in order to avoid side effects from Rituxan with steroidal IV and Benadryl first hour. 2 hr into Rituxan infusion I developed severe side effects, life threatening. If the excellent team of doctors and nurses wouldn't work on me with knowledge and experience, I wouldn't write here. Right after 2 hr into infusion I developed terrible itch in ear and scalp; in 2 sec burning pain developed from scalp down to my feet followed by huge dark purple hives and huge blisters all over my body. Oxygen tank was administered when my throat started to close and I hardly remember anything after. I was for another 8 hr at the hospital on steroids (IV) and IV anti histamines. 3 weeks after, I still on Prednisone and Benadryl, still terrible pain/sensitivity of the scalp and ears, terrible itch of the scalp. Due to life threatening experience I cant even use Rituxan again. I cant even describe the burning pain all over the body, such a scary experience.  I don't wish this on anyone. Please be very aware of side effects and immediately let the nurse know if you feel any changes. Seconds matter to save your life, this is not a joke-drug.  Best of luck to you",1
"During first infusion, my throat started itching and I got a slight reaction.Doctor added more benadryl and slowed down the drip. Two weeks later I had the 2nd infusion and they did it very slowly.Into the IV they injected steroid, benadryl and gave me 2 Tylenol.I had to wait almost 2 months before the Rituxan kicked in.They gave me a Medrol Pack to help me get into remission.I am now not suffering with rheumatoid arthritis pain and it is a blessing, but I have come down with the Shingles on the left side of my torso and it is very painful and itchy.I am feeling very tired and fatigued. I took antiviral meds for one week. Not sure if the Rituxan lowered my immune system and that is why I got the Shingles. Hanging in there.I will see my Rheumy next week to discuss this.",5
"I have been receiving Rituxan by infusion for 6 months. This is my second round. I have been amazed at the wonderful results I have had with this medication. It was almost like being RA free! However, when it comes time to receive the infusion that's another story...I have a serum reaction and am extremely nauseated for at least one month. I take Ondestran (sp) for this, but it doesn't help that much. All in all I feel the days free of RA are so worth the hassle of nausea. ",5
"I can walk now. 3 years ago, before a plasma treatment, I could not. ",4
"It was given 4 weekly treatments for ITP, after several other medications failed. My platlet count has been back to normal for 5 weeks now. It was critial and down to 1000 and it took 5 days to go up past 10,000.",5

"I am a 50 year old woman, who has suffered with rhumatoid for 15 years, and have failed on all the drugs I have been offered, I recently have had Rituxan and thought it was probably working untill this week when the coughing started again,and wheezing lung problems, will there ever be a drug I can take that does not cause this side effect, I cannot go from the house because of the coughing choking and wheezing, so there is no point in being able to walk I may as well be bedridden, can anyone help with this problem. I am getting so down with it all.",2
"I am a 25 year old single parent with a 7 year old daughter. I lived a perfectly healthy life until 3 years ago when I woke up one morning and couldn't lift the sheets off of me in bed. Went through a divorce (guess he was too young to deal with it all) and have been on several different meds trying to find something that works. I'm starting Rituxan in two days, I'm really nervous about starting it, but I have been trying to remain positive. This site REALLY helps me with reading everyone's comments, although I can't really find anyone in my age range to talk to about it. I will try to post an update after Wednesday, with hopefully some good feedback. Orencia, methylpredisolone, prednisone and sulfasalisine has all not helped me at all. All I want to do is get on the ground to play with my daughter, teach her how to play softball, just have fun with her... I wish you all the best. ",1
"I suffer from Ashma therefore I had difficulty breathing, it went on for the first two days after the treatment. The second night was the worst since I felt like my lungs were closing up. This is the second time I've had the treatments. First time I was pain free for almost 3 years. I hope to have the same success this time.",3
"I have not started this treatment yet. I have tried Cytoxan and Imuran, then Cytoxan again with CelCept. And here we are again with another flair up. My Drs are wanting to try this drug now to see if we can get me into remission. I will repost after I have started this medicine. Hopefully we will have better results than with the last treatments. Although I am a bit scared. ",1
"Rituxan was my 1st & ONLY treatment for NHL, marginal B-cell.  Used it every 6 mos. (1/week for 4wks) for 3 years.  PET Scans, etc. have been great.  Am back on ""watchful waiting"" because they are ""afraid"" to let me take it any longer.  No side effects. Used a port in my left arm. Drove myself to & from treatments. Wish someone would write a paper about my wonderful success!!",5
"I am 55, with two small kiddos to take care of. Prior to Rituxan, my pain levels were horrible. I could not even button their shirts without crying. I had less pain less than 24 hours after the first IV. Now we horseback ride again, play on the floor and have great fun! As my 8 year old yells, NO WAY RA!!! Thanks for my life back.",5
I have had no side effects that I know of,3
"I'm back for my final post. Had Rituxan on 3/3/11 & 3/17/11. had appt w/ my rheumy yesterday & she was shocked. all my labs indicate that Rituxan did absolutely nothing for me. had horrible flare ups the last 2 weeks - sed rate & other RA markers up so high...even higher than when I was first diagnosed in 2003. So, we are moving on to Actemera. Again, Rituxan did absolutely nothing for me. Hope the rest of you have luck!",1

"I have had remittting relapsing MS for 30 yrs. I have been having Rituxin infusions every 6 mos for the past 3 yrs.Before Ritluxin I was on many different meds, but they were not effective. I had been falling frequently when my neurologist wanted me to try rituxin. Since using that I have only fallen twice, which is a MAJOR improvement.",4
"Although the first infusion takes several hours, it is otherwise no more difficult than any other and I had no immediate infusion reactions. However, several weeks down the road I showed up with kidney damage. It's not yet clear whether or not my kidneys will heal. Meanwhile, after 2 infusions and 4-1/2 months, there is no evidence that the Rituxan has had any effect on my severe, advanced RA and I'm on the highest ongoing dose of prednisone of the past 23 years in order to get by. I've also been on antibiotics much of the time from respiratory infections, and will not be able to try another disease modifying agent until I've recovered from the Rituxan. I had high hopes for Rituxan, which have been dashed. (The most effective medication for me so far has been Humira, but I don't have adequate insurance coverage for it.) ",1
"I'm back w/ a follow up post after 1st posting here on 3/20/11. It's been 5 weeks since my last post (a little over 7 weeks since my 1st infusion; over 5 weeks since my 2nd infusion). I thought the Rituxan was working but I feel back at square one (when I first got diagnosed & had the most painful flare ups) in the last 3 weeks. My doc keeps saying to give it 3 months, but I don't know how long I can last. I'm back on pred 20 mg/daily, then she wants me to again taper down to 7.5. Just want my old life back! A.M.s are the worst, so hard to get out of bed, and the last few days, I have really had no relief throughout the day. Yesterday, my ankles and knees hurt so bad, I could hardly walk. My rotator cuffs have been killing me & it's all I can do to get some sleep. Pain everywhere. I'll be a sport & give it 3 months; however, I'm already thinking of changing MD's (my current one just took over my former MD's practice; I'd been w/ my former doc 8 yrs & loved him to death. This new one graduated from med school in 2005. Only difference is, she also has RA.) I am praying, praying, praying all the time for some relief. I'll write back in a few weeks. Wish me luck!",1
"Each treatment (4) took 24 hours to administer. Two months after the last treatment I am still having sores breaking out on my face and my fingers, hands and other joints are hurting",3
"After 7 great years on Enbrel, I had a very painful flare in my hands.  A brief trial of Humira provided no relief. My pain and disability were only relieved by steroids.  Soon after my first infusion of Rituxan, I was able to begin to taper the steroid dose (it has taken many months to wean completely off).  I have always been  very active.  I am an endurance cyclist and run agility with my dog.  Rituxan has enabled me to basically function, as if I was disease free.  Six months after my first round, I was given a second series of two infusions, although I was RA symptom free.  Very few side effects...basically a couple of sleepless nights after the medrol dose given with the Rituxan.  My labs are normal except for a slightly lowered WBC (3.9).  I feel well and am now steroid free. ",5
"Diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma in 1988. Except for a couple months break I've been on chemo ever since. When tumors break out I go on full treatment with several drugs. In between I'm on ""maintenance"" of only Rituxan and Benedryl. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for this drug. I am so grateful!",5
"I've had 2 treatments for my 1st month & plans are to not have another for 6 mo. Very encouraged with progress - no flare-ups as before requiring injections & trips to the ER for morphine, toradol, prednizone & IV fluids (all intraveinously). Feel terrible for a couple of days with severe fatigue, nausea since 1st infusion (lost 10 lbs in 2 wks)and headaches. I've tried EVERY drug for RA but have always gotten infections and had to stop them. Hopefully, I can stay on Rituxin and it will work. I've had RA for over 30 yrs; I am now 57. I also have osteoarthritis, bursitis, tennis elbow and many other medical conditions. I am also bipolar & have suffered from severe depression, including a suicide attempt. I rarely have depression now, partly due to feeling better; however, my mania has increased.",5
I have been running a fever for a month. My energy is completely gone. It has been close to a month and I feel awful.,1
"June, 2009 Dx with Perpheral Neuropathy. Led to Dx of WM same month. Started 860mg Rituxan every 3 months, along with decatron steroids and alkeran chemo. Steroids once per week, 12 pills per dose. Chemo 5 pills per day for 5 days, then nothing for rest of month. Originally IgM was at 7,900. After one year, Igm was down to 2,500. Discontinue steroids and chemo. Retain tri-monthly Rituxan. Now, 18 months later, Igm at 2,000. Have had only one side effect with Rituxan, and that was severe flushing of the skin into a deep red. Stopped treatment for 10 minutes, then resume slowly. That was two months ago. Once, early in the treatment, awoke in early morning freezing, with severe shakes. Took three blankets, and an hour to calm down. That, and the incidence of flushing during treatment have been the only side effects in 18 months of treatment. Oncologist trying for as low IgM as possible, but further treatment dependent on Neuropathy condition, which has not receded completely. Still have no feeling on bottom of feet, and serious pain if I walk too much. Also, as reported earlier by someone, tips of fingers have almost no feeling. Tend to drop things a lot. Dr says that nerve regeneration in hands and feet may well take another 2 years. As far as using the drug, I will have to continue a 3 month infusion for no telling how long, as the Waldenstroms is not curable, only treatable. As the French say, ""C'est la vie"" (that's life)",5
"Almost killed me, but maybe saved my life too.  My BP dropped and I had stroke-like symptoms for days after treatment. I was supposed to get 4 treatments but they stopped after one due to the neurological side effects. I still have numbness and tingling on my left side. However, my ITP has stabilized with platelets over 300k.  I would be very cautious and only do this with docs with lots of experience.",4
"I have relapsing remitting MS. I've tried several other drugs in the 4.5 years I've had MS. This is second best after Tysabri. It's great not to have to think about taking medicine but once a year. I have no symptoms, except I'm more fatigued with this medicine than Tysabri. I've also had a few bladder infections in the last 6 months that caused extreme fatigue. I never have bladder infections, so I don't know if the drug has had an impact on that or not.",4
"I have been on this medication for about 2yrs.  It has been the only medication that has releived my pain. Before the medication I couldn't hardly move my arms,hands or fingers.  ",5
At first i had the iching and they slowed down the IV and that seemed to work. Other wise it works. ,4
"Use Rituxan for secondary progressive MS. My neuro said that people in wheelchairs would start walking after the first two infusion.  However, I felt I needed a wheelchair after my second infusion.  Although I was able to take the medication easily with little to no side effects, I felt my legs getting weaker instead of stronger.  Will be discontinuing - definitely not worth the risks for me!

"Just started after a severe bout with inflammation of every joint, I am for now pain free.",4
"It had been 7 years since my last treatment course for Small Lymphomcytic Lymphoma (same as CLL).  But in late 2009 I became very anemic so this time (feb 2010) we did Rituxan with Treanda.    First treatment left me EXTREMELY anemic and had to get a blood transfusion.  Felt soooo much better after that.  I was pretty fatigued for about 2 weeks following each treatment (had 4 each 4 wks apart.)  I also broke out in a bad all over rash - bumpy red, small blisters and itchy!!  High does Prednisone was the only thing that helped.  The Doc thinks it was the Treanda I was reacting to, but Rituxan can also cause rashes - so who knows?  It's now been 3 months since my last treatment and all my lumps are gone, and I'm almost back to full strength - though still tired a lot.  See the doc in a couple more weeks for a follow up and blood work - we'll see...",5
".with my first treatment my throat started itching and swelling.The nurse gave me benedryl and slowed the drip.Second infusion 2 weeks later went ok.About 5 days later I started feeling weak all over nausa terrible headaches ever day.My legs got so weak I felt like I would fall if I didn,t sit.Night sweats ,my joint pain got worse.My heartbeat was up.My doctor said I have serum sickness which is uncommon.I looked it up on line there isn,t much about it.My doctor put me on predsione,it is slowly getting better.I was hopping the rituxan would work i,ve tried orencia,humeria,plaquinel.My hair fell out for several months,I have Laten TB and have to take meds for 4 months now because my immune system is weak.I will be happy to just feel the way I did before the first treatment.",1
At this point I have had 44 treatments of rituxan over the past ten years so far it has not cured my Illiness but it helps keep in in check. I feel tired for a week after the treatment then I start feeling better.,3
"I have no energy. Very Depressed, Vision problems and I feel sick all the time.",5
"With the first infusion, I saw results of less pain and stiffness within two weeks.  I have gotten the second infusion and I feel better than I have in five years!!  I have less pain and more mobility.  The inflamation is almost gone.  Unsure as to how long this improvement will last, but it is great so far!!  Taking the Rituxan IV has been the best decision for me!!",5
"I've had RA since I was 18 have tried all there is to try, but with rituxan I feel so much better.  I'm just starting my 2nd infusion but can feel the difference, hope evrything works out and that this is ""IT"". ",4
I have cll; started rituxan when wbc hit 288.after 2 rounds wbc went to 4.Been healthy for 2 years so far.  2008-present,5
My first infusion seemed to affect me less than the second.  The main side effect has been a severe headache for at least 24 hours after each treatment.    Looking forward to learning the outcome after completion.,4
"After the effectiveness of Enbrel started I tried Remicade with no luck. Rituxan has given me a new lease on life. I am able to do things I haven't done in years. 6 hours is a long time in a chair along with 2-3 days of fatigue, but it is worth every minute to feel good for 6 months.",5
"I am afraid of listing my problem..is so bad..I had numbness in my toes and a surgeon did a triple bye pass of my legs.. 5 days after I recieved my dose of rituxan...now i think that it was the drug and I was put through hell ....7 operations and lots of infection and los of blood loss, i hade t5 liters of blood.  would like to hear if anyone else had similar experience.  thanks p",3
I have had a violent reaction on 3 occasions I have had this medication.,3
"I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and CLL Leukemia in June 2009. By August, I was critically anemic and losing weight uncontrollably. The Dr. placed me on IV chemo, including Rituxan, Cytoxan, and Fludarabine at 4-5 week intervals. The treatment literally saved my life and has given me a future. It's tough for three days after the drugs are administered, I can't eat or drink much during that time and keep it down, but thereafter OK again. The medications helped me, my blood numbers are going in the right direction, body weight is easier to maintain, and energy levels greatly improved! One issue with the Rituxan: I had a strong allergic reaction to it (scalp itching, rash on abdomen, shortness of breath about 15 min into the IV). Even though I was given Benadryl beforehand, they had to give me a Hydrocortisone IV to stop the allergic reaction. Thereafter, Benadryl + Hydro became part of my chemo regime, and I could take the Rituxan OK.",4

Started having severe monthly flares after receiving seasonal flu shot Oct 2009 (now banned from flu shots!).  Had 1st Rituxan infusion mid-Jan 2010 and 2nd 2 wks later as directed.  1st dose stopped RA from traveling within my body several times per day, and helped lower body immensely just after 1 day.  Upper body joints remained inflamed and painful.  1 day after 2nd dose left my joints virtually pain-free; range of motion still limited though.  Side effects remain of nausea, sweats, chills, but I'll take them over the joint pain anyday as they are temporary.  Both times I was prepped with tylenol, benedryl, and an steroid so I no adverse reaction during the infusions.  Definitely a good thing so far!",4

"I had acute ITP and was given this drug four times. I had a very uncomfortable reaction during my first session, throat closing, sweating, etc. But the nurses slowed the drip, gave me steroids and slowly started up again. I did not have any other reactions. It has been over a year since my last treatment. My platelet count was 5,000 when I started and has been well over 200,000 for more than a year. This drug appears to have cured my ITP, and for that I am thankful. However I now have a serious case of GERD (chronic reflux). One of my doctors suggests that the drug may have caused this because it is a very powerful drug and can be very hard on the rest of your body. But the bottom line is: I WOULD recommend this drug for treatment of ITP. It was unpleasant and it may have caused another problem, but it worked to raise my platelet count.",5
"Was diagnosed in  June 2008 with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) First round administered July, 2008 had an initial allergic reaction consisting of itching, hives,  was given an antihistamine and continued treatment without incidence. 2nd round Sept. 2008, pre-treated with antihistamines, no allergic reaction and no remission.  Side effects included loss of equilibrium, memory impairment, progressive paralysis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  Patient died in July 2009.  While this is not common, the fact that it is an untreatable and 100% lethal condition, it must be noted in order to assure a truly informed consent, as it is a possible complication to the administration of this medicant.",1

Beverages with electrolytes help as well. Also am given demerol while receiving Rituxan. Really helps with any reaction during infusion. Have had lymph nodes become enlarged during the treatment period. Dr. said it's just waxing & waning-scary. Have 2 treatments to go and no port.

"In reply to an earlier question, I have had tingling and numbness also in my fingers and sharps needles downs my legs My Dr says it might be neuropathy I didnt go for the EMG cause i was scared, I just had the RITUXAN treatment today and it was very difficult for me it is my 3rd one and this time the reaction was very scary my throat swelled up my ears wouldnt stop itching they almost had to stop it but My nurse is excellent she is great she knew exactly how to give me the med, but my first dose it went well for apprx. 8 months then my 2nd one in March only lasted 3 months my RA is going very rapidly and they dont know why I've had it now for 5yrs but didnt discover it till 3yrs ago. I wk f/t typing for 8hrs and its very hard my fingers swell up and my hands are aching in pain. I feel that pretty soon work will be over I pray each day to help me get up and go. I have my days where I just sit and cry and cry cause the pain is unbearable, in the process now i have 2 herniated disk and 4mm erosion, my fingers are slightly showing signs which are my biggest fear, but all i can do is pray and take it day by day, For everyone out there that has this I pray for you cause I know the pain you endure and I know there are days that you can't get up but you have too.

"So far okay. I still have to do the maintenance rituxin - 4 weeks every 6 months for two years. Here is my question: Is anyone getting a vibration or strong tingling feeling for no reason? Now if I bend my head down, my legs really vibrate a lot and act like they are going to stop working-kinda like a mis-fire in the electronics!?!?! Hard to explain. I don't like to complain or even comment to the doctor, because I always get the ""Huh, never heard of that before"".",4

"It sounds like I am in the majority when I had high hopes for this treatment to stop my RA disease progression and symptoms. After my second round of two treatments (the first only helped for 10 weeks), my rheumatologist is satisfied that the Rituxan has stopped the diseases progression, that is, the synovial inflammation that causes damage to the joints. Although I do feel better than on any other treatment (I have also tried many-8 or 9), I still have tenderness and moderate pain in all of my joints (bilaterally head to toe, basically), varying degrees of fatique (not extreme as before) and 1-2 hours of stiffness in the mornings. I do not have noticeable swelling in any of my joints on this treatment, which is great. I am also still on Methotrexate and now Plaquenil and occasion, dose packs of steroids. Is this the best we can expect? What percentage of RA patients can be treated and be symptom free except for a few bad days here and there?? Thoughts???",3
"I'm a 44 year old female who was diagnosed with RA 18 years ago. I was hoping this wonder drug would be the one that works for me. Unfortunately, I've had some tough side effects that aren't necessarily listed on the drug website. Extreme fatigue, swelling of the feet, coldness in my lower legs & feet, tremors, even joint pain have been my experience. It's been a month since my first infusion and I'm praying for the day it will be completely out of my system. The cost for my first infusion was over $13,000 - I would have felt better if they gave me the money rather than the medicine! :)  ",1

"It has been 2 years now without any problem with my ITP, since being given 4 treatments of Rituxan. The hard part about it, I have had problem breathing when I walk, or my heart would just beat really fast without me doing anything. I have a types of seizure that my Dr can not even stop. I have more problems now then what I start out with when I went in to get treated for the ITP. And I can't get nothing done about it. I have a seizure problem, and they did not know the side effect between what I was on and the Rituxan.",3
"I DO NOT HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS WITH THE RITUXAN,  OTHER THAN THE FATIGUE,  BUT THAT COULD JUST BE THE CANCER.  I ALSO GET THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN WITH THE RITUXAN.  IT WORKS FOR ME!",5
"I just started my second round of infusions. I have the second in this series in two weeks, then I'm done for another 6 months. This one went much smoother than the first round. I had an allergic reaction during my treatment and it took 6 hours to complete. I have to take Benadryl and Steroids along with the Rituxin. I slept most of my treatment from the Benadryl and then couldn't sleep that night from the Steroids! Other than being a little achy and having the chills, I feel fine. Hallelujah!!",4
"I have an autoimmune disorder with eye inflammation for at least 3 years.  Rituxam IV is the first procedure to give me pain relief and the inflammation is decreasing. It is experimental with my symptoms, but seems to be helping.",5
"I was at stage 4 non hodgkins lymphoma, went on the Rituxan and six months later was cancer free, no hair loss or bad side effects, only a little sleep loss the day of treatment due to the other drugs involved.Did 2yrs of preventative treatment one week every 6 months. Still cancer free after three year. Thank You Rituxan !! ",5

"I took it for SLE and Dermatomyositis.Only reaction was fever,chills,backache,tiredness. I have had 2 treatments. I am giving it some time to kick in, although my pain is not as severe before starting this treatment.",4
I am going through my 2nd set of treatment. My body usually hurts all over neck to toe. Treatment takes all this pain away.  My only problem is feverish checks and lower temperature with chills.  I find hot teas and resting it out for a day helps. Then wow no pain.  I used all the other drugs from Enbrel to Orencia and they work very well but since my condition is full body I find this is the longest I go without pain and I feel stronger and healthier.,5
"I was hoping that this medication would be the ""ONE"" that worked.  No such luck.  Had an adverse reaction to it within the first 2 hours.  Oh well on to the next one.",1
Miracle drug!  I was at Stage 4 non-hodgkins lymphoma and after my first treatment my spleen and lymph nodes were all normal and the fluid around my lung was gone and after my 4th treatment I was cancer free and have been for 3 years now.  I did receive Rituxan every six months for two years to prevent the cancer from returning and had no side effects! Great drug!,5
"i have SLE I took this medication for treatment of my joint pain.  I had a severe rash on my body but went for the second treatment.  In the infusion room I got extremely dizzy that they slowed down the drip, however a few minutes later I developed a rash on my face and swelling of my hands and pain in my back.  A week later I got a rash all over my body, my heart was beating so fast I went to the ER for dehydration.  It was an extremely scary and horrible experience, I would NEVER do it again no matter how much my joints hurt. Now with a low dose of Prednisone and Methotrexate I am doing fine.",1
"My hematologist perscribed this medication for my chronic ITP (platelets below 5,000) and I had already had my spleen removed for the initial occurance 9 years ago.  The initial treatment was very unpleasant, it gave me hot and cold flashes, chronic cough and my throat went numb.  In the three following treatments they increased the benadryl and decadron they gave me prior to initiating treatment which caused no side effects during the treatment but for 12-48 hours I have facial flushing, swelling of my hands and feet, headaches and trouble sleeping.  I also have horrible heatburn and feel fatigued all the time.  On the bright side my platelets are up and better than they have been in 6 weeks.  The excellent medical care I have received helps also.  All in all I would recommend it but only as a last resort.",4

Rituxan IV has been every effective in the treatment of my ITP (autoimmune disease). My platelets have risen in number. I am so thankful to my doctor and physcian assistant for looking for alternative methods of treatment for my autoimmune disease. ,5
"I take tylenol and benedryl before treatment. That helps with any possible side affects. (fever and allergic reaction). When I get the infusion it takes 5 hours, they give it very slowly to determine how it will affect you.  My blood pressure usually goes down, which is not serious, but it happens.  I am fortunate that I do not experience any other side affects from the drug.",5
"After just two treatments with Rituxan, I am cancer free. That was within 6 months after being put on Rituxan for Follicular lymphoma.I had no side effects from this drug. This drug has saved my life. I am very greatful for this wonderful drug.",5
It was used as an alternative treatment for my Auto-Immune Disease (ITP). The treatment sessions was unpleasant. The results of the treatment have been amazing. I've been at a stable level for 9 months now. Thank you Doctors & Nurses!,5

My Dr has high hopes that I will have good improvement.",4
Been on this drug for eight years. Now only have treatment once a year. Controls my RA very well. I don't use any other drugs.,5
"Had stage 3 low grade follicular lymphoma. 3 treatments once a week and blood tests showed no cancer. I got reaction first time and took benadryl. Second time, little reaction, third time no reaction. Was also given 10 mg dexamethasone intravenous. If it comes back, I would use this drug again. Never lost my long hair. A wonder drug for sure.",5
I have taken Rituximab three times and just started my fourth round due to ITP and an enlarged spleen. I have not experienced any side effects and have already had relief from the drug. I will continue to take this drug as needed. It has changed my life for the better.,5

I started with Rituxan when I was diagnosed with cll. My wbc was 388! I had four rounds of rituxan along with treanda. My counts returned to normal.

My neurologist put me on Ritaxun in April 2013.  It has been ok for me, especially slowing down the progression. At time of IV, I had intense severe headache. That was the only severe side effect.  I did have weakness that was better after 2 months.  My next infusion is October.",3
"I've been on Rituximab for about 1-1/2 years with another year to go for Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. I get just about all of the side effects one can get from this drug. Since I was on a full cycle of R-Chop during the height of my treatments and had all of the side effects from those drugs, this is a breeze compared to before. The Red Death (Vincristine) is so aptly named and caused so many problems for me that Rituximab is easy despite the effects. ",4

Rituxan has greatly reduced the size of my affected lymph node sites. The most notable side effect is an uncomfortable itching rash on my lower leg for the past six months.,5
"I have vasculitis. Diagnosed 2006. Been on Prednisone, Methotrexate, Cytoxin, Imuran... Nerve damage in my feet, legs,hands, head.

First infusion APRIL 2009 second infusions March 2010 since late June have suffered dry cough sometimes leading to slight chest pains but RA fine,5
Three treatments for Systemic Lupus.  Each produced a full year( and a couple of months more) remission. ,5
My mum died from breathing problems within 4 months of taking this drug. She had no previous breathing problems at all and also suffered a minor heart attack before she passed away. I wouldnt take this drug if it was the last thing available on this planet.,1
"Got very sick during first treatment.(Vomiting,chills,fever,dizziness) Exce llent response to next 3 treatments using mid-way meds (Benadryll). Stage 4 Cancer now in remission ! (Also received a series of needles to raise hemoglobin & white blood count.)",5
While having my first dose of rituximab I had an allergic reation (after only 25% of the drug)so the treatment was stopped.  Several weeks later I ended up getting PCP (pneumonia) and spent 2 weeks on a ventilator and 3 weeks in the hospital.    Now I am very careful of ANYTHING that gets into my body.  BUT I will still try and work with and around the medications.,1

My first infusion was in July 2006 and it saved my life.  I could hardly walk.  I was getting ready to file for disability and then my doctor suggest Rituxan.  It worked in the first 2 weeks and I have been using it ever since.  I tried every drug used for the treatment of RA and this drug is wonderful.  I advise if anyone out there who has not gotten any relief from all the TNF drugs.  Try this one.  Good luck.,5
"I had my two infusions in April, 2009 and so far have no improvement in my pain and fatigue. I have also developed a vaginal infection which will not clear up. I have tried all the other drugs before this, so am very disappointed that I have not experienced any improvement in symptoms as yet. Heres hoping.",1
This was the first drug that ever helped all the fatigue and fever and chills.  My sed rate went from 69 to 7.  If I had this drug years ago I may of not had so much damage.,5
"My husband was diagnosed in 1997 with RA tried Remicade,Enbrel,Arav, Kineret with little to no relief by 2005 he was on 2 canes almost unable to walk his hands were unable to make afist his Dr. told him of Rituxan in 2005 and he received his first treatment in March and second in May by the time of his second treatment he was on one cane and his hands were able to once again start to close now he walks 2 miles a day nodules have disappeared and only has pain occasionally he receives a treatment once a year and I am very happy to see walk unassisted.

"I received my first infusion in April 2008.  I am going to have my second inifusion within the next month, as some symptoms are returning.  That's 11 months between treatments.  I had no side effects at all.  I take Arava 20 mg. every day.  I feel so good I can barely remember how awful I felt.  Prior to Rituxan, I tried Remicade and Embrel.  Both were effective for a short time but did not last.  I am looking forward to a great summer without pain.   ",5
I first received this drug for CLL & found it also controlled joint swelling & pain. At that time RA was suspected but not yet clinically diagnosed. I have had RA for several years now & this is the only drug I take. My insurance wouldn't pay for it for a while & I tried 3 other RA treatments of which none worked. Blue Cross of Al now has a policy for moderate to severe RA & will pay for 2 infusions every 6 months. 4 infusions every 36- 48 months worked better.,5
"My wife waas given this dangerous drug in 2007 because she had low platelet count and it was presumed to be caused by her body's immune system. Rituximab surpressed her immune system so much, she became infected in the hospital with MRSA blood stream infection and died from septic shock.",1
I have severe RA with lupus that has been unresponsive to all other medications or I have had severe side effects from them. I have had 2 infusions and after 1 month I am at least now able to stay out of bed all day and seem to be improving slightly. I did have severe nausea for about a month but no other problems,3

"I have the complication of Lupus along with the RA.  I had the IV in Sept. 2008 and still experience pain, fatigue and weakness.  Other complication include diabetes, HBP, high cholesterol.  So I do not if this was the most effective treatment for me.  I also take 15-20mg prednisone, plaquenil, methotrexate, vicodine and iburprofen.  I feel like I am loss this battle after only 2 years.",2
"I was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis. I was given Rituxin three times.  There was no improvement, so the therapy was stopped.  I did develop a bowel obstruction 3 months after the last infusion, but no one indicated a connection between the two.  A review on this site by a Lupus patient who had the same thing makes me wonder.",1
"Prescribed for SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS / SLE / LUPUS. Rituxan worked as great as it did terribly. It eliminated my severe symptoms but also triggered a life-threatening bowel obstruction. If the bowel obstruction had not happened, I would absolutely still be on it. Other than the bowel obstruction, I didn't have any side effects. I wish I could find something that works as well as the Rituxan did, but obviously, I can't take the Rituxan again.",5
I had the medication 6 months ago this is the longest between treatments. I am going tomorrow for another. Looking to have a great holiday without so much pain.,4

He was on varies dugs walking with 2 canes and his hips were deterioting, he became a test patient in 2005 on Rituxaman and within 2 weeks he could see improvement his joints began to reduce and after the second infusion he was ready for a hip replacement.

"I now have the JC virus with PML due to the use of Rituxan. I only have maybe 9 months to live. I would have rather died with NHL than to be like I am now.

"After having severe RA for 25 years and trying everything under the sun, this drug changed my life. I'm more active, have lost weight, am happier because I feel like me again, the me that disapeared when I got this disease. I even had to warn my grown kids that they were seeing a side of me they'd never experienced. That's a good thing.:) I've had two sets of two infusions 6 months apart. I've been taking 500 mg of Sulfasalazine daily, but not sure if I really need it. All my labs are normal now. Wow am I happy.",5
"I had my 2 doses October 2006.  My hands were crippled and I was in severe pain.  I felt better after the first dose, but after my second dose I was in remission.  I have had no pain or side effects from this treatment, and I have not had to take this treatment again.  My RA factor is zero.  I would recommend this treatment to everyone who had rheumatoid arthritis.  The only problems I had right after taking the treatment was nausea and hair loss.  The nausea went away in about 2 months and my hair grew back very thick and curly (which I have never had curly hair).",5
this medication has changed my life. i am know able to do things on my own and i have not received a flare up in a year.,5
"I did get a blood clot immediately upon starting, I use blood thinners now to avoid this issue.  I had Peolonged QT, but eliminated all other drugs that cause it, and my heart stopped doing this.  I do suffer from PVCs which is fairly common, avoid the sun as it will burn your skin but in all, it is working, no headaches, and rare nausea!  Hair and nail growth as slowed drastically and skin is super dry, but can manage with face cream.  Overall... highly recommend, just keep an eye on symptoms in the beginning and your heart while using - Kardia Mobile has been a huge help!  The wrist band is better as you can keep it constantly watching your heart.  ",5

"Effectiveness is good, but the patch routinely fails to adhere, even with tape around the edges. The last three patches haven't stuck for more than 24 hours.",4
this protect did not work for me. I had an allergic reaction to the sancuso patch.,1
As a full time caregiver to an inoperable stage 3b lung cancer patient I was dreading the next round of chemo care. We heard about the Sancuso patch and decided it could not work any less than the standard drugs we had been using and decided to try it. It is worth EVERY Dollar!!! She had NO side effects from her chemo. It was like she didn't even have a chemo treatment. I'm nearly in tears thinking how many treatments/torture she went through before this patch. It has been a miracle!,5
Sancuso is not expensive when a co pay discount card is used. In fact with the copay card patients can sometimes get 4 patches for $30. The Pharmacies prefer to fill generics so sometimes they exaggerate the cost to dissuade patients. ,4

Also, experiencing low blood sugar.",4
"I was on it for 6 months, had to stop due to pregnancy.  was a treatment for acromeagly. helped the majority of my symptoms, only thing i can really complain about is the approval process to get approved by insurance.  The shot is VERY expensive and extra steps have to be taken with insurance to get approval but the manufacturer of the drug was very helpful in getting my claim approved and shipped directly to my doctors office.  After original approval i didnt even have to call for refills the manufacturer or my drs office called each other and it was automatically filled",4
Can do injection at home as is premixed and ready to go. Extremely expensive (2300 per injection) but my insurance covers for now. Get a lump under the skin but it is not painful and it des not fully go away before alternating back to that side for the next injection.  I have had 3 of these so far for acromegaly. ,5

Since Gleevec is no longer an option, hoping sprycel works out. If not, dasatinib will be next stop. I am thankful for medicines which keep me going but wish an alternative with less disabling side effects could be found. I believe research is knocking on that door.

Almost 2 years in and I only notice more frequent mouth sores and very unusual menstral ing  cycles.

I was always a very health conscious, gym going, water drinking, no fast food eating person so this diagnosis came as a complete shock. I am just trying to find out if more women have experienced issues with their monthly cycles after beginning this medication. ",5
"My most severe side effect was mouth sores. I did also experience headaches at first, but they went away after a month or so, a little joint pain also.  I became unresponsive  after 10 months.",4
I was so sick before taking this medication I can't even begin to tell you.  If I am having side effects anything is better then the alternative-not living.  I have completely changed my diet to glutton free.  I also will only eat Kosher meats that are not soaked in blood.  I gave up all processed sugars and proceeds food and I have not felt better.  I went into remission in 3 weeks.  I have been on Sprycel for 2 months. Feel free to contact me if you need an encouraging word from God. [email protected],5
"I started taking it January of 2014. I experienced a drastic platelet reduction. Then I stopped taking it for over one month. Began again, the side effects were worse -- experienced platelet reduction, RBC reduction, weight gain, headaches, tiredness, depression and chest pain.",2
"I was diagnosed about 2 years ago, I am in full molecular remission. However I am 29, I suffer from chronic fatigue and I am now dealing with the fact that I want to get pregnant and there is no research, its very hard, There are no studies of what the outcome may be, I have to come off of it while pregnant, there are no studies as to how quickly my WBC will rise. Its frustrating. I can no longer go in the sun for periods of time ( I used to be a big tanner, I live in Florida ;) ) As well as I cannot tolerate heat and another weird side effect is that it has turned my eye lashes and eyebrows blonde. I'm a brunette. But other than that I AM IN REMMISION :)",5
"It worked like a miracle drug for me, yes there are a few side effects, dirreah, bone pain and I've had a little loss of hair but not much. The fact you have to take this the rest of my life is crazy but hay I'm in remission.",5
Been on Sprycel 100mgs (1 tab) a day since August 2012. Diagnosed July 2012. Feeling pretty lucky. No pain and my blast cell count greatly reduced. Waiting on big 12 month results. Only differences are the not too frequent tired days and I can't carry heavy bags or groceries now as my arms will ache (drives me nuts!) :),5
"Great excepect for being very tired, some confusion and depression",4
"Severe bone pain from both Gleevec and Sprycel, Gleevec stopped working, Sprycel has caused other problems as well as the bone pain.  Disabled due to side efttect of both the disease and the meds.",5
"Started on Gleevec, caused severe bone pain, stopped working, switched to Sprycel, can only tolerate lowest dose, 50mg, still have severe bone pain as well as quite a few other side effects.  In remission for the last year or so.  On disability, not able to function well due to pain and pain meds.",5
"Compared to Tasigna, (Nilotonib), which has a 3 hour food window twice a day, this has been so much easier, and I am able to maintain my weight. Since I have been on Sprycel, my CML has gone from 27% of my blood, to 1/10th of one percent.  I am currently in both molecular, and cyber genetic remission.  I should remain this way, as long as I take Sprycel everyday, for the rest of my life.",5
"At first like any medication you need to give your body time to adjust. For those that complain of yest infections wash you self with water every time you use the bathroom and dry with toilet paper. Don't just wipe with toilet paper.  I went to MD Anderson for a second opinion. I needed to know if i was taking all i need to take and if I could push my self or just lay  back and stay tired. After being told that I vould push my self I went back to the gym and started off as someone that just started working out. It takes time to get your body back to a normal routine. I did what I could and worked my way up. After a couple of weeks I was back to normal. Now I'm able to take two classes back to back and feel great. I do step, Total body wheight lifting, yoga, treadmill, eleptical,  my oncologist homogoligest  doctor put me on a dieratic for my water retention. You have to see a hemotioligest no just oncoligest.  If you could find on that is  both even better  I am not letting this control my life. I am trying to take control of it. I have my bad days, but very few. I was diagnosed in mid January of 2012.  My white count was back to normal within 3 months after taking the Sprycil . I have been in remition for 2 months now. I'm scheduled for another bone narrow on the 16th of this month in MD Anderson.  No one should ever give up. You can turn your self around. After all it could be worse. I am very thankful to god that Sprycil is available for our condition. I sometime forget that I have CML. ",5
after taking this med for 5 yrs i just recently started having severe joint and bone pain.,5
"Started on Gleevec when diagnosed 6 years ago. 1.5 years in, switched to Sprycel, could barely function on Gleevec from extreme nausea. Minimal side effects on Sprycel. Full remission for 6 months now. Minor side effects: occasional nausea, heat intolerant. Able to fully function. This drug saved me :)",5
"Diagnosed Ph+ CML 04/07 when 67.  On Gleevec until 10/2007 with good results, but with strong side effects (skin sore, cramps). Changed to Sprycel 11/2007 with very good results up to date 04/2011 (major cytogenetic remission, Bcr-Abl/Gus < 0.1 %). No side effects at all. I live as if I had no illness. Only have to take 2 x 50 mg pills daily. I feel very fortunate.",5
 Achieved PR undetectable in five months on Sprycel and maintained PCRu at 8 mos after developing severe hepatotoxicity to Gleevec afer five months of its use.  Mild side effects noted mostly skin issues and fatigue but I am fully functional.,5
"I started this medication as a ""last"" alternative to a BM transplant. Since taking Sprycel my CML is in complete remission. No side effects worth mentioning at all. I was given the ""6 months"" to live talk almost 2 years ago. With 2 small kids, a wife and under 30 things looked ugly but  im still around! THANKS SPRYCEL!!!!!!!!!",5
"I have severe headaches, joint pain, and fatigue with this drug.",5
"Having many side effects from Gleevec 400mg (tried less and vacations from it, too), after 8 mos. was switched to Sprycel. Four months later (11 mos. from diagnosis) there was no trace of CML left (PCRu). Some fatigue is main side effect, slight edema. Mainly, within two days of starting Sprycel, the brain fog lifted. Am very happy with Sprycel.",5
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,3
I need this medication the AARP cut me off JANUARY 2010 I am starting to have headach again whe I went to fill my perscription the phamisist wanted $4554.86 I do not have any money for these meds I make 11.00 per hour when I can work i any one know of an agency that can help call me 50mg 412-378-1454,5
"after 10 months of use I have Pericardial Tamponade, and Plurel Effusion. I cannot take Gleevec or Tasigna due to severe reactions. Now its a waiting game to see what happens.",3
"   I was switched to Sprycel after developing both resistance to Gleevec and intolerance of the highest dose. My first few months on the drug (at 140mg) were very unpleasant, with severe headaches, enlarged and tender breasts, and constant bouts of mild to moderate fever. I also developed anemia and mild heart problems. After resting from it several times and going down to 100mg/day, I now tolerate it well, and while my PH+ number tends to rise in Winter I have generally low numbers of PH+ cells. I have been using it for more than 3 years now and am still stable. I have had CML for over 15 years.",4
"13 years with ph+ cml started gleevec{after 5 yrs no treatment}tolerated for 2 yrs then sprycell for 1 and half yrs now.Side effects include Bone pain,cold sweat with severe chills{quite debillitating},some acne,depression and malaise, some memory deficit.Recent plueral effusion and pluerisy. Bone pain and acne satisfactorily treatable.Complete cytogenetic remission with less than .001 pcr {undetectable}",5
"My father has been on this for 1 year, has extream weight loss. Continuous fluid in bothlungs requiring draining per aspiration several times and this week,chest tubes. ",2
"In 9/08 I was diagnosed w/ Philadelphia chromosome positive CML. I have a long history of migraines, that, w/ daily medication, have been under control since 2001.When I 1st started Sprycel, I had an almost constant mild migraine (yeah - an oxymoron) for 8 days. On the 9th day no migraine & I've been migraine free since. I've had no other side-effects. At my diagnosis, 88% of the cells in my bone marrow were leukemic. At my last biospy in 12/08, only 6.5% of my bone marrow cells were leukemic. So the Sprycel is working!",5
"I was diagnosed 3 years ago with CML, I was put on Gleevec which after one year my body rejected it. I was put on Sprycel 140mg. I was  Philiidelphia Chromazone positive with CML. After one year I was reduced to 100 mg, now there is no PH positive in my blood, my leukemia is holding it's own on just 50 mg. I have had no side effects while on this drug like I did with Gleevac. My hair has grown back in, my potassium levels never drop out of the normal range now like it did on the Gleevac. I am extremely satisfied with this drug, and because it's less expensive then the Gleevac, it should be the first offered when first diagnosed.  Patient",5
Went into respiratory failure within 7 days of taking this medicine,1
I used sudafed inhalents and put it on my PJ's this caused me to have difficulty breathing and Ikept feeling as though I was going to die.  Now that I have stoped using the stuff I am ok.,1
"I have taken this drug for 18 months. Tried Lonsurf first, but it was only minimally effective. Never did IV chemo. Aside from slight fatigue and mild to moderate foot pain side effects are mild. Effective at keeping CEA low.",5
"My mother took Stivarga to treat metastatic colon cancer. Obviously she was very ill to begin with, but the side effects of this drug were torturous. Her oncologist's words were that, rather than slowing growth, Stivarga appeared to have ""seeded it everywhere."" The oncologist said that that was the experience of every patient who had tried it. Stivarga did not change the outcome of my mother's illness, but it made the last months of her life much more miserable than they had to be. If we had only known then, we would have opted not to try it. ",1
"Have taken Indian package Stivarga from bonhoa.com for over a year. CEA well within normal range. Slightly elevated bilirubin. Only side effects are mild to moderate hand foot syndrome, some fatigue and nosebleeds due to low platelets. Stivarga is really very expensive for me. The Indian package with different name also manufactured by Bayer and packing in India but prick is only 5% of US Stivaga. I bought it from bonhoa.com, until now it works very well. Gob bless all of you!",4
"I am writing this as a data point for those who may be considering this drug. My mother was recently put on this and it was literally the worst drug she's ever taken in her 6 year journey battling cancer. I read the reviews and begged her not to take it, but she went through it anyway. The drug caused her to be lethargic to the point where she could not move, she had a severe loss of appetite, she broke out in hives, she lost a significant amount of weight and could barely walk/clothe herself. She literally could not function. She took it for two weeks and by the end of it was so incoherent and weak that she collapsed inside of our home. And this was from taking 2 pills one week, 3 pills the next. Imagine if she tried taking the recommended dose of 4. By far the scariest experience we've dealt with. She was taken off the drug fortunately and is in recovery. She now has another option with Mekinist (which sounds promising), but I genuinely do not see how Stivarga drug was FDA approved. This drug took her down faster than the cancer ever could, AND on top of that it's a maintenance drug. It doesn't even shrink tumors, just keeps it from growing. All those devastating side effects isn't worth taking this drug. If a doctor is recommending this for you or your loved one STAY away. It does NOT work and the pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing it on the market. ",1
My needle phobia precludes many cancer drugs. This is easy to take. I am only in my second week on this medication. 2 tablets daily. Few side effects so far other than faigue and some slight hand/foot soreness.,3
"This drug caused hyperbilirubemia, hepatotoxicity and extreme high blood pressure leading to the death of my spouse. ",1
this is a torture drug. how this type of medication could pass the FDA?,1
I am starting my third cycle and my CEA numbers have gone up,3
"Do NOT take stivarga for the love of God you will have liver failure in a few weeks, especially if you are older and have to take 4 pills a day. THIS DRUG IS FATAL. My father had liver failure because if this DO NOT TAKE. DO NOT!!! Take your chances with a naturopath that does vitamin C IV's.",1
"Do NOT take srivatsan for the love if God you will have liver failure in a few weeks, especially if you are older and have to take 4 pills a day. THIS DRUG IS FATAL. My father had liver failure because if this DO NOT TAKE. DO NOT!!! Take your chances with a naturopath. ",1
"Through first 21 days, scans were positive and  seems to be doing alright with pills. Dosage keep to 3 pills, get sick when taking four. Back for more scans in a few weeks.",5
"This drug killed my brother and proliferated his kidney cancer. He presented to hospital with fluid in the lung. Tests revealed kidney cancer with metastatic spot in lung. After less than three weeks on Sutent solid tumors had formed in the lung and chest wall. My brother lost all quality of life on this drug, he could barely walk through weakness caused by Sutent, his face swelled, basically he had all side effects. The oncologist did not explain fully what side effects may be serious, nor did he explain possible negative effects such as proliferation of cancer this drug can and does cause in many people. This drug was given to my brother and he was sent home to get on with it. No  monitoring or contact from oncology department. My strong and well built brother survived only 2 months after taking this drug less than 3 weeks. He was not given proper information to enable him to make choices. People considering taking this drug tread very carefully, explore other options before going to this killer drug. In my opinion every cancer patient should automatically be given chemo sensitivity tests prior to treatment.",1
I have the Sutent from the online pharmacy bonhoa.com for 9 months and was extremely fatigued but minimally nauseous. Doctor guesstimate is an additional 9 months. Original diagnosis was clear cell cancer and removed right kidney. Annual exam revealed it metastasized to left adrenal gland. Pet scan reveals some tumors have disappeared and remaining ones are shrinking. No new tumors seem to have appeared. My quality of life has not seemed to have decreased and I feel blessed everyday that Sutent therapy is working for me.,5
"I had a radical right nephrectomy 24 years ago at the age of 41. I did not take any medication or receive any chemo following the removal of my kidney & the tumor. 5 years ago the cancer reappeared. I had a craniotomy to remove a tumor from my brain, kidney cancer. That was followed up with a PET scan which found I had Thyroid cancer, removed 6 months later & a spot on the middle lobe of my right lung which was removed 4 years ago. The spot on the lung was kidney cancer. At first my oncologist had me on Votrient. I took that for about a year. My oncologist then switched me to Sutent which I've been taking since spring 2014. I was taking 50 mg for 4 week on & 2 weeks off. The side effects (diarrhea mostly) were bothering me for about 3 of the 6 weeks. I've been on Sutent 37.5 mg, 3 weeks on & 1 week off and the diarrhea is a bit more tolerable but I still have it. It occurs mostly toward the end of my 3 weeks on but sometimes it occurs at other times in the 3 weeks I am taking Sutent.  I had a PET scan last year and it was clear, so the surgeries I had several years ago along with the Sutent is keeping me alive. The brain MRIs have been clear as well. Thanks Sutent! The trade off is the discomfort of dealing with diarrhea for days at a time. I have also learned that there are certain foods I cannot eat while taking the Sutent. Greasy food are verboten! I am getting a little tired of having to deal with diarrhea but I suppose if Sutent keeps me cancer free I'll just deal with occasional diarrhea. I drink 6 oz of Kefir each morning and that seems to be helping my intestinal issues.  Sutent works for me, no new lesions for going on 4 years now!",5
"I am a 64 rear old male.  Had a radical nephrectomy removing the right kidney 1 Nov 2016. Went on Sutent Dec 2016 for 2 nodules in left lung.  I've been on 50 mg 2 weeks on and one week off and have now been on it for 4 months.  In the first 3 months the only side effects were a few sore knots on the bottom of my left foot and some intermittent fatigue.  I never stopped working full time.  The last month the fatigue has intensified and in the last week my blood pressure went from 115 over 70 to 140 over 70.  Even stranger, my normal pulse of 70-75 went to 46-50.  I have no dizziness or any other symptoms associated with the lowered pulse rate.  In the last week the diarrhea started and gotten progressively worse.  Per my physician I quit sutent until my appointment in 3 days.  I will also have a scan at that time to determine the efficacy of the drug.  Unless results are significant, I expect to request surgery to remove the lung cancer",3
"60 yr old Male, 170 lbs. Radical nephrectomy (left kidney) done Dec 2015. 2 nodules in right lung. Started Sutent 3 and half months ago. 50 mgs. 2 weeks   one week off. One nodule has shrunk to half its original size. Side effects include nausea, fatigue, itching of the skin and blisters in hands and in nostrils, blisters in mouth, diarrea, feeling cold even on a hot day, severe stomach acid, gas, blotting, white hair (starting with eyebrows and beard) and minimal loss of hair. Some weeks I have some side effects, some weeks others. To handle side effects I take the medication right before going to bed so the nausea happens while I am in bed (sometimes I have to get up and vomit). For the acid, I stopped taking omeprazole b/c is reported to be bad for the kidney, so I use a grandmother's remedy: I take baking soda (one tsp solved in water) to fight the acid and the gas. Baking soda works like making a big bubble in your stomach but it neutralizes the acid: I feel much much better after a big burp. Baking soda has helped me throw up when I had a very upset stomach. Skin and blisters I treat with some vaseline or cream. For diarrea, I take every morning Benefiber, and it does wonders to make your stomach whole. I have to live with the gas. For fatigue, I exercise (at least I walk) as much as I can --I use to be able to swim a mile, now I do a third of a mile, but I feel great after the exercise, more energetic. ",5
"4 1/2 years on Sutent at various dosages. Left kidney removed as well as right adrenal gland. 9 Nodules in lungs when started; all gone. Some side effects but still working. Still have cancer, and will until gone, but this drug has helped keep me here this long.",5
"I recently lost my brother who was only 40yrs old diagnosed with RCC. After one million different tests that they did for almost one month on him doctors come up with an idea to start him on Sutent50mg saying it works on 70%of people. It's all big lie. People please don't believe it doesn't work at all. Instead it makes your life more misearable. Side effects of this medication actually killed him faster. Swollen legs, unbelievable chemo imbalance in the body even paralysis of one side of his body, collection of fluid in his lungs. They end up putting up chest tubes on him to ease up his breathi. Doctors were trying to prove to me that its his tumors growing. It's not true. He came to the hospital with his own legs. After the first session of completing Sutent therapy which is 4weeks he changed completely. It did not work a bit.After begging doctors to continue the battle since Sutent didn't work thaey were trying to explain that all medications practically does the same thing and it doesn't make a sense to start new therapy even thouhg before starting any traetment on him they were saying thereis 7 different drugs to treat RCC.I'm feeling guilty of starting him on this pills.It only killed him faster and made him suffer more. I didn't understand in the beginning that chemo pills don't only kills cancer cells but kills our normal cells more. This is 21century and it's so sad to believe I couldn't save my brother in the country where people come from all over the world for treatment. I lost him in 4 months.In the last few weeks of his life doctors were saying they still don't have treatment for RCC they only try to prolong the life.Unfortunately it doesn't work.I'm in tears every day. If I only knew this in advance. Try to spend as much as possible the time with your loved one. It was very terrible to sit next to him and realize that you are just helpless. ",1
"Right kidney removed 7/2011.  PET scan 12/2011, showed 4 small tumors.  Started sutent 2/2012,  50mg-2 cycles, 37.5mg-2 cycles, 25mg- 2 cycles, 12.5mg-currently every 4/2 cycles.  PET shows no RCC cells.  YEA.  Side effects tolerable, no major problems.",5
"One year after radical nephrectomy was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Have been on Sutent for about 18 months now, 37.5/day, two weeks on, one week off... Side effects are unpleasant but manageable and fairly predictable. On Sutent tumors have either disappeared or have shrunk steadily to very small sizes. This drug has been a life-saver for me.",5
"Only on 3rd week. Bad bloating, fatigue and sleep disorder",3
"There are many side effects. I can deal with these so far. I have been on sutent for 4 years. Currently 25mg, 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off. I started with 50mg then 37.5 mg. So far as I know it is effective. Scans next week. ",5
Very good,5
food has no taste and loss of appetitte,4
"Dans le cadre mon cancer du rein avec métastases au colon, et au cerveau, je prends le Sutent 50mg depuis 3 mois. Les effets indésirables sont une fatigue importante, manque de tonus musculaire, perte d'appétit, baisse du goût, saignement rectal, assèchement de la peau. Les efforts en valent la peine puisque ma tumeur au cerveau de 15mm c'est complètement résorbée en 2 mois. En d'autres termes, ce médicament m'a sauvé la vie même si c'est dure au quotidien.",5
"My mom was prescribed Sutent for kidney cancer.  Had pre-screening x rays, heart test, and blood work.  All checked out great.  Started in October.  Took until Dec 6 when she developed pneumonia - couldn't kick it.  Doc took x-ray, found extremely enlarged heart - caused by Sutent.  She had side effects of sores in mouth, loss of taste.  Never could kick the sores in mouth, her body was worn out from the heart damage.  Even cancer doc said Sutent ruined her heart - kicker was, it didn't help her at all, tumors still grew.  Changed medicine, but damage to heart was too severe, she was never able to kick the pneumonia and died from it.   Wish doctor had given is other options, or explained better the chances of heart damage.  Downplayed it, other message boards have several people with heart damage from it, too.  ",1
Lots of unpleasant side effects,5
"My mom used Sutent - 4 weeks into it she got pneumonia,, doc did x ray found out her heart had been damaged from the  Sutent much like another poster's wife.  She never recovered from pneumonia, she got a bit better but had to be on oxygen the final 4 months of her life due to the heart damage and had persistent coughing which wore her out.   I'm thankful it is working for so many, but people should know heart damage is a real possibility as side effect so they can watch for signs.  The last thing mom needed was heart problems... They thought she had clogged arteries so did tests, said her arteries were ""pristine"".   But damage had been done to the heart from Sutent in only 4 weeks, that ultimately led to her dying from heart failure.  Please - if you take Sutent watch for shortness f breath and swelling.   God Bless everyone reading this page, it is a horrible cancer to battle.  ",2
"My wife (49) was diagnosed with kidney cancer in december of 2010, she had a partial nephrectomy for the tumor. About 8 months later i noticed a lump right on her scar line towards her back, she had a ct scan done and it was confirmed as cancer. She was referred to cancer and kidney specialists and was set up to take sutent 50mg. She was on her third week of taking the pills and started to experience mouth sores, vomiting, no apetite and general weakness. At this point i took her to the ER to have them help with the nausea and mouth sores. She was admitted at her own request. The next day she had been seen by a nutritionist and a kidney DR, also an infectious disease DR. He in formed her that she had a UTI. I spoke with her on the phone that night and she seemed ok and said that she was able to drink a can of ensure thanks to the oral medication for her mouth sores. The next morning i received a call from her doctor who said that she was having trouble breathing and they had to intubate her per her permission, he asked if she had any asthma problems or allergies and i said no. The doctor called me back about 20 min later and said that her heart had stopped 3 times. I was at the hospital by now and saw her in ICU and basicly on life support. He said she had fluid in her lungs and fluid around her heart and here organs were being compromised due to the lack of oxygen. Her pupils were unresponsive and to make a long story short, she passed away several days later after 3 more heart failures, nothing else could be done. WHAT HAPPEND? What happened overnight in such a short time, this was a nightmare! I feel the sutent compromised her immune system which caused her UTI to become septic and therefore kill her!",4
"Medication causes blisters on my fingers and feet, which are very painful to grip anything or walk with out any pain. it seems to attack bunians on every toes where their is one and on the bottom of my feet.",3
"Three years ago my father was diagnosed with Stage IV renal cancer that had metastasized to his lungs.  Without any treatment, he was given 6 months to live.  He was too ill to tolerate surgery so we decided to try Sutent.  He was initially given 50mg daily and became deathly ill. The Sutent was then decreased to 25mg which he tolerated fairly well.  He has experienced all the side effect (fatigue, diarrhea, swollen ankles, hair turning gray, hypertension, watery eyes, etc) plus some. The cancer shrunk significantly and is now basically in a ""hibernation"" mode. Currently, he is doing fairly well and we feel blessed to have him here.  Here's the new problem.  The Sutent appears to be damaging his kidney function.  Dad's kidney function tests went from 58% in 2008 to 44% in 2009, to 21% in 2011 (for some reason it was missed in 2010).  If Dad drops to 15% we will need to start dialysis 3 times a week.  Not a great option.  We are now torn between trying a new medication or spreading out the time between dosage breaks. So, watch your kidney function closely. Controlling cancer is one thing but killing your kidneys in the process is not good either.      ",4
"Had rcc in lungs about 5 years.  On Sutent about 4 years.  Minimal growth each cat-scan.  Tired heavy feeling legs,loss of appetite, heart burn, sensitive mouth, some diaherra & fatige, watery, puffy eyes are the main side effects experienced.  As time goes by, feeling more tired,less energy. Overall has been keeping the tumors small with minimal growth.   ",3
"Had my left kidney removed in 1999 due to rc cancer.  No problems until 2004 where it had metastised to my right lung. Radiation successful, except for scarring of the lung. In 2006, it had metastised to the tail of my pancreas. Radiation shrunk it, but did not remove it. Later scans showed it had gone back to my lung.  The last scan showed it had gone to my liver.  Am now on Sutent. It's too early to judge the effectiveness. Side effects have been mild, so far.  ",3
"Am commenting on behalf of my beloved late husband. He took sutent for about 2yrs 7 mos. for renal ca. He (as a suspected result of his sutent therapy...as per his M.D.) developed total renal failure, and needed months of hospitalized dialysis to survive. He eventually developed many complications, and he passed away @ age 58. His cause of death was not cancer, but cardiac and renal failure. I am sorry he ever took this drug, as it caused him to suffer greatly during the last 8 months of his life. ",2
"My husband, had right kidney removed for RCC, 6/07.  Also effected several lymphnodes.  Sutent was the first oral chemo he go.  It lasted/worked for 22 months until it failed and he moved to another chemo (next was Afinator which lasted 11 months).  He now is on Votrient.  It has been over three years now, and he's still alive and active (thank our Lord!), but Sutent had the worst side effects of any chemo.  His feet were so sore (bottoms) and hands, that especially his feet, he said when he walked, it felt like walking on shards of glass.  Also diareaha, but it worked ALOT longer than the average person, and he is only now slowing down on work (fatigue from lastest chemo) and it's been three years.  He's stage 4, and still works on his FEET (in retail) all of this time with oral chemo, so it's been a real blessing.  That's been our expeience.  Thanks for listening/reading.  ~~A greatful Wife in IL",4
"Just had my second set of scans on Septmeber 3rd of 2010. The nodules are gone in both my lungs. Had surgery in December of 09, removed left kidkey, large portion of my vena cava and had between 6-8 nodules in my lungs. Just before beginning Sutent in January I had another scan that showed the number of nodules in my lungs had increased and the largest one had nearly doubled in size. After the first 3 months of treament 1st scan showed major improvement, then this last scan they are all gone. Nothing on my scans at all. Doc still wants me tocontinue taking the drug so that is what I will do.

"Just finished 3 months of treamtment, had a positive result on my scans, the kidney and vena cave were full of cancer and surgically removed in December, at that time I had 6 or 7 nodules in my right lung with the largest one about 2 cemtimeters. The first set of scans after taking the drug showed the largest one of these nodules had shrunk to about 1 centimeter and the others were shrinking as well. Side effects minimal and well worth the results. Worst thing was occasional diahrea but controlled with Immodium very easy. This drug has let me continue to lead a normal life so far. Hope we seee the same positive results on my next set of scans",5
"After il-2 did not work , started sutent  march 2009 so far side effects cracked elbows and feet muscle spams ,always suffered back pain which makes it worse burn easy in the sun , fatigue, stomach problems otherwise cells are stable hopes continous to work",5

"i have been on sutent know for 17 months,i have liver metz, the tumours have turned to cysts, which is great news for me, i am coping with the side effects, hand and foot syndrome, diarraha, my hair turning white,(everyone says it looks great), have now got an underactive thyroid,so im on medication for that,but they do get easier, and as long as the sutent is working i can cope with any side effect.",4
My husband was diagnosed with esphageal cancer on september 18 2009. Went on Sutent and Taxol in october. Developed a rash on his buttocks was told that it was shingles and that the sutent could not have caused it. By november the rash was worse. Then diagnosed with a staph infection. Still according to the doctors not caused by the sutent. By the end of november the rash was oozing and the skin was turning black. He was admitted to the hospital december 2nd. Where we were told that the staph infection he had was acctually MRSA. The cancer treatment center never informed us that he had MRSA when they knew about it back in november. Needless to say they still recomended he stay on the chemo and sutent as he was part of a trial. The hospital immediately stopped all cancer treatments and started him on antibiotics. As a result of his weakened immune system the antibiotics caused his kidneys to fail. By december 8th his lungs had started to fill with fluid as he was bleeding internally. At that time he was placed into Hospice Care as there was no hope for any kind of recovery. He was allowed to come home where I could take care of him until he died December 20  This was after the doctors assured him if he went on the sutent trial he would have a life expectancy of a year or more instead of the 3 to 6 months without the treatment. At the time of his death he wished that he had never gone on the sutent. So anyone out there on Sutent please pay attention to anything that just does not seem right especially rashes. I read that this had also happened in France in another Sutent trial for the same thing my husband had. ,1
"Almost 2 yrs on drug. Qtrly CAT scans show no added growth in tumors. Side effects: diarreah, lethargic, very tired, no taste, even mild foods burn (use Biotene instead of reg toothpaste), high blood preassure, elevated thyroid counts. All side effects controllable with drugs or OTC medications. On balance, a good drug for RCC.",5
"Side effects are rough include loss of appitiie, Sore hands and feet, diahrea,sore mouth. this goes away when on the 2 week off period",4
"my mother has been on this drug for less than a year. At first the side affects were awful and she was removed from it. Then they lowered the dosage, now for the most wonderful news of all. This drug only helps 30% of people, she was told this drug would not save her life only prolong it. Well, she started with tumors in her lungs, her glands and in her liver. Now she has NO tumors in her lungs, no glandular cancer and only a small amount of tumor left in her live. A drug that we were told might prolong her life has saved it. The doctors have actually mentioned the ""r"" word. After this next dosage the cancer in her liver may be gone completely and we can say she is in remission. I cried when I heard the news.. Thank gods for this drug. Yes it only helps 30% but those 30% it could be a life saver for!!",5

"Like mustangRZ I too have been taking Sutent for two years. I started taking 50mg, but like so many others, I had horrible side effects. My doctor kept a close eye on the effects and decided to change the dose to 35.5 mg. I still get side effects, but not so severe. I take 1 pill a day for 28 days then off for 14 days. I still work every day and for the most part feel pretty darn good.",5
"I was diagnosed 6/17/09 with Stage 4 metastasized renal cell carcinoma that manifested in my right lung.  I started Sutent 50 mg on July 3rd. Had to discontiue on July 20th due to having ALL the side effects. I was prepared for one or two, but not all of them piling on between the 2nd and 3rd week. Just as they all piled on, my wife fell and shattered her knee cap and broke her wrist. She was in the hospital recovering from the surgery and I was home too sick with Sutent side effects to go see her in the hospital. I had the sore mouth, bleeding gums, a huge ulcer formed on my tongue, incredible nausea that exceeded the nausea drug's ability, fever approaching 102, painful swallowing, extreme fatigue, more than normal shortness of breath (I also have CHF & COPD which produce shortness), diarrhea, sore and stiff neck and back, blood pressure dropped as low as 69/35 (nearly called an ambulance, but it came back up some).  I quit the Sutent. After a month off of it, I'm normal again and have restarted this week at 2 12.5 Sutent per day. In 2 weeks we will increase to 3 per day and finally 4 per day in hopes to avoid the side effects. No cat scans yet so I haven't a clue if it's actually working yet.",1
"I am a caregiver of a stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma patient which has spread to his pelvis, bones, lymph nodes, lungs, and more. His doctor recommended  Sutent. She gave him 1 year or less to live. He was on Sutent for a total of 5 weeks. Two weeks on and then off because of complications the Sutent caused. In and out of the hospital we were with 2 operations because of the affect that Sutent had on other functions. Sutent was killing him faster than the cancer. He stated that his insides felt as though they were disolving. Sutent made his sugar level rise to nearly 200 which made for an emergency trip to the hospital which was a nightmare. Sutent gave him gout in both feet. The exhaustion and lack of appetite was overwhelming. He lost 10 pounds in four days. He could not taste most food and what food he could taste was horrific tasting. Smells made him ill. His quality of life was far worse on it than not being on it.  Since going off the Sutent he has gained 16 pounds, eats like a lumberjack, has planted a 70' x 30' garden, a 40' wildflower garden and is taking supplements and poly-mva. He has stopped eating meat and cut out all sugar. He looks great and is regaining his muscle back. We have taken the Holistic way of health which includes mind, body and spirit. It is eight months later and we are convinced that if he had stayed on the Sutent he would not be with us today. Perhaps you should restrict your useage of Sutent on further testing of labratory animals. ",3

"My grandmother was issued Sutent recently for Stage 4 Renal Cancer.  Unfortunately, the drug did not work for her.  Sutent apparently accelerated the growth of the cancer and also contributed to an ulcer she developed.  As of February 22, 2008, she has been removed from the drug and has been given up to 2 years to live.  She also experienced several very rare side effects with this medication, taking her doctors by surprise.",1

"I was diagnosed for her2-positive breast cancer and October of 2017 I went through chemo as well as radiation chemo was horrible radiation my body tolerated 4 months ago I was introduced to this drug tamoxifen. I've been feeling horrible every since. I feel like I have had a stroke on my right side my brain hurts I have trouble thinking even completing daily tasks. I wake up to dizzy spells and hot flashes. Blurred vision, change in color vision, stomach pain, Headache.Hot flashes, vaginal discharge. pain or bone pain. Loss of interest in sex Trouble with sleeping.This drug I will not continue treatment. Not worth side effects.",1
"I am 69 years old and just completed radiation after a lumpectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma. Since I just started taking tamoxifen I really can't say anything about side effects, but I'd be anxious to hear from someone who is around my age and has taken tamoxifen for 5 years. The thought of the side effect of cancer of the uterus scares me. I still have a uterus and ovaries. My friend had to have a hysterectomy, from she swears using tamoxifen. Has anyone else experienced this? I'd like my quality of life in my senior years to be good, not worrying about something like this. Also, not to mention starting through menopause symptoms again along with a discharge? What's that about? I may be rethinking all this.",3
"Today is my 2 year mark of taking Tamoxifen.  I had breast cancer in 2015 followed by double mastectomies.  I hate this drug!!  My hair stopped growing, my eyes are blurry, my periods are every 3 months sometimes, my body aches, the hot flashes finally eased up, I'm tired and get more headaches than normal.  Can't change drugs until I'm in menopause.  I'm 52 so I hope it's soon!!!",5
"I was diagnosed in December 2013 with stage zero DCIS. Had a lumpectomy followed by one week of partial breast radiation. I was at first put on Arimadex (anastrozole) high I took for about a year. I could no longer deal with the side affects, so my oncologist switched me to Tamoxifen. It has been easier on my body. My side effects have been: terrible hot flashes, rare night sweats, hair thinning, lack of energy, trouble sleeping, feeling of weakness throughout my body. I started taking potassium for foot cramps and that has helped a lot. Oh, and my resting heart rate has increased from around 80 to now 100-105. The only thing my oncologist said was, ""Your heart sure is beating fast."" Apparently it is not a listed side effect. Heart doctor said my heart is fine. So, I decided to stop taking the Tamoxifen for one week. My heart rate slowed back down. So yes, it can definitely increase your heart rate. Both my oncologist and breast doctor said that exercise is key in staying cancer free. I've started brisk walking with a neighbor. A ketogenic to low carb diet like Atkins are also good. I've read that cancer cannot survive with the ketones in your blood. I recommend the book, Fight Cancer with a Ketogenic Diet. Hope this helps!",4
"My name is Jennifer. I was diagnosed with DCIS in June of 2016. I had a lumpectomy in my left breast with 30 radiation treatments. I started the Tamoxifen in Oct. So its only been 6 months. I can honestly say I do not like this drug. I have leg cramps, hot flashes, sweats, chills and aches and pain and some other issues I'm not going to mention. I am a high risk just by having Leukemia as a child and plus family history. Prayers for everyone on this drug. ",3
"Nine years ago I had a small lump that was cancerous in my rt breast. I had a lumpectomy and 35 radiation treatments. Eight years later I had another lump in the same breast and it was cancerous as well.  Had modified radical mastectomy and 3 of 4 reconstruction surgeries. I have been taking Tamoxifen for 9 months.  I too have the severe hot flashes, can't sleep nights, I used to have thick beautiful hair. Not any more! My fingernails are paper thin. I am lethargic, get winded real easily, have gained weight.  I am on meds to lose weight. I hate this drug.  If I didn't have grandchildren that I want to see grow up, I would be off of this stuff in a New York minute.",1
"Oct/2015:  biopsy results were questionable.  Nov/2015: lumpectomy came back positive for Stage 0 DCIS.  Dec/2015: bilateral mastectomy completed.  Feb/2016: began tamoxifen, daily.  I was postmenopausal prior to my surgery so the return of night sweats was miserable.  The night sweats have back off some but I experience leg cramps during the night now.",4
"Diagnosed with DCIS, Stage 0 in Feb 2016. Am a 66 year old, white female. Had lumpectomy followed with 30 days of radiation. I did not want to take Tamoxifen due to side effects, but decided to do so and then re-visit with medical oncologist if having difficulties. I take in the morning after breakfast (20mg). I have noticed hot flashes during night time sleep, but fortunately not too bad- no night sweats. I am experiencing leg/foot cramping off and on, but also had prior to taking Tamoxifen, so not sure that is a factor. As long as I stay aware of physical changes, have yearly PAP smears and pelvic exams (uterine cancer concerns) and yearly eye check-ups (Tamoxifen contributes to cataract formation) I feel I am doing the most I can do to stay safe while taking Tamoxifen. Of course, this includes breast mammograms, MRIs as suggested by my breast surgeon. ",4
"I'm 36 and am on tamoxifen 5-10 years. I'be also had a double mastectomy and am on one year of herceptin. Since starting the tamoxifen my tumors markers have plummeted so that's a good thing but the drug has been difficult to handle. Insomnia, night sweats, some mild hair loss but not noticeable to anyone other than me. The worst has been feelings of anxiety and panic. Just trying to stay with it and remain cancer free. I was stage 1A.",5
"I have been on Tamoxifen since March 2016 and I have noticed more mood swings, severe hot flashes, aches and pains, fatigue and I seem to have ""peach fuzz"" on my face!!  My last period was March, it threw me into menopause.  I'm 50 and had ductal carcinoma and a double mastectomy in September 2015.  The percentage of getting Uterine Cancer from this are low I hear but something to consider before taking this drug..",3
"I were diagnosed with Lobular breast cancer at 44 in 2010 which had spread throughout my right breast and to my lymph nodes. I were also estrogen and progesterone positive. I started Tamoxifen after completing 6 months Chemo and 5 weeks Radio September 2010 and were told I'd be on it for 5 years. The most noticeable side effect were the hot flushes however as time went on I've had growing memory loss, joint pain vision deterioration not to mention anger and anxiety which I'd not felt before. I stopped taking it November 2015 however started bleeding which I've just found out is due to a huge pulp in my uterus which I now have to have a hysterectomy as they couldn't remove it all. My Breast care specialist has changed me to Arimidex for a further 5 years as I am now post menapausal but looking at the side affects for this new drug I am reluctant to continue and wonder is it better to just take my chances?",5
"Im 50 and was diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma on my 50th bday August 2015.  I chose to have a double mastectomy.  After reading ALL the horrible reviews, I VERY reluctantly,started Tamoxifen Mar 22, 2016 and all I have noticed is my moods seem a bit all over the place, I'm easily irritated and my hot flashes increased.  My weight so far has stayed the same and no hair loss as others have mentioned.  So far, so good.",3
"I was diagnosed with DCIS-stage zero in 2014.  I had bi-lateral lumpectomy surgery, followed by 33 radiation treatments. I was told I needed to take Tamoxifen for 5 years following the radiation. I am almost 2 years into taking the Tamoxifen and dealing with being lethargic, moody, muscle and limb weakness, and worst of all HOT FLASHES that make life miserable. I find it hard to get out of bed.  Multiple visits to the ER on top of everything else. I HATE this drug!!",2
"Diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer with sentinel node involvement (2 of the 8 nodes taken were positive).  After radiation I was prescribed Tamoxifen.  Was on the drug for about 8 weeks which were the worst in my life.  Side effects included constant fatigue, joint pains, back pain, hip pain, to the point that it was hard to get out of bed, bi-polar moods, depression, crying all of the time, lethargic and feeling suicidal.  Not to mention the less annoying symptoms of headache and sweating.  I'm an active 51 year old; ride horses, exercise daily, always outside doing something.

The risk of the adverse affects were greater than initial dx.  Continuing off the drug with close supervision by oncologist and surgical oncologist.",2
"I took Tamoxifen for 5 years, 5years ago and I had a good experience with this medication. I have degenerative osteo-arthritis.

Started Tamoxifen Aug 11. Worse side effect was nausea, so I started taking it before bed to sleep through the nausea period. I was premenopausal at diagnosis and the chemo stopped my periods and started the hot flashes which come as night sweats.  Rarely have any during the day.  No other side effects except those two.  No depression, no weight gain (actually lost 10 lbs).  I don't eat a lot of sugar, salt, stay away from processed and fast food.",4
I was told i had a 3cm tumour in my right breast near the lymph nodes. After a lumpectomy it turned out to be grade 3 cancer which is fast growing and invasive. It had not spread and my centinel node was negative. I had 3 weeks of radiotherapy and have been in pain ever since. Had such a big seroma i was crying with the pain. Went back to see my surgeon and had another scan.I had  more seromas by then and had some drained.  I have been on Tamoxifen for about 5 months now. I hate it! The cramps-hot flushes-complete exaustion are just too much to bear sometimes. And i've noticed my face getting a soft downy hair on it. Have to take Tamoxifen for 10 years. ,2
I have been taking Tamoxifen now for 5 years I had a Lumpectomy 4 rounds of Chemotherapy 20 rounds of Radiation and now still on Tamoxifen I was on 20mg but reacted too well to it and have been reduced to 10mg I curse it every day I have extreme hot flashes the anxiety is getting worse I also take Effexor that was suppose to help it helps some of the mood swings I would be aweful without that I get headaches constipation you name it I get it. Now my oncologist tells me he wants me to stay on it for another 5 years! Oh and not to forget the lack of sleep and the weight gain.,5
"I have been taking tamoxifen and effexor for a little over a year, after lumpectomy, radiation and no chemo.  I feel tired and lethargic all the time. No sex drive, brain fog,muscle aches, and severe constipation are the worst things because these were never a problem before tamox. The first 6 months my hair was falling out in chunks,but my onco said it wasn't the tam. The next time I got my prescription filled, I noticed that ""hair loss"" was listed after ""stroke"" under side effects, so there. The hair loss has stopped, but I also started taking biotin to help my hair.  I have to take tam., but I'm only 53 and I feel 100.  ",3
"In 2012 at age 49 I was diagnosed with LCIS and atypical hyperplasia and have been taking tamoxifen for almost three years and will take for a full five years.  My side effects included not getting my period, hot flashes, rash on neck, aches in my bones.  I am also on effexure for the hot flashes and night sweats.  That didn't really help, but my mood improved.  Recently my hot flashes and night got worse,  I am now doing acupuncture and it has greatly improved.  My hot flashes are almost gone and I got my period for the first time in three years.  ",3
"I was diagnosed in 2011 with Lobular carcinoma.I took 40 mg of tamoxifen for a couple weeks but was decreased to 20 mg because of leg cramps and heavy feeling. I have continued the last almost four years on 20 mg with good results Id say. I have had to had surgery again in 2013 but it wasnt malignant. Yea Ive had the migranes,very rare now,hot flashes occasionally the only thing that has got more frequent is leg and foot cramps BAD and my vision seems to be getting weak.

"At 27 i was diagnosed breast cancer, but on my first operation the doctor has cut through the lump so the cancer spread through the breast, but not elsewhere.I had chemo 6 sections and then tamox and zoladex still taking them for 1 y and 10m. I have developed osteopenia, nervousness, dry v, mood swings, teeth cavities, weight gain, hot flashes, forgetfulness etc. Iforget to take a pill. I hate the feeling this therapy gives me. i want to quit it but my doctor says at least 5 years and maybe 10. I don't understand why so long when i am cancer free from the second operation till now. And would i be able to have children if i take these medications so long?",4

I have been taking Tamoxifen for over three years now. I have had excessive hot flashes and mood swings. In the summer of 2013, I had to take a two months break from the medication because of my hot flashes.  I also have eyes irritations and itchy skin. Recently, Sept. 2014, I had a D & C to stop excessive bleeding, remove polyps and reduce the thickness of uterus walls. The polyps were noncancerous - Thank GOD. Now as a postmenopausal woman, I have to have my uterus removed, Jan. 2015, because of the contiuous bleeding and polyps quickly reforming. Although my Oncologist took me off of the Tamoxifen immediately, August 2014, because of the bleeding - the side effects continues.It makes me wonder if the benefits of the medication outweighs the many side effects that the medication causes. I have an appointment with my oncologist today to discuss medication options. I will see my primary care physician in a couple of weeks for health updates, just before seeing my ob/gyn surgeon in Jan. 2015. Ladies, make sure we do our part in getting the most effective health care by going to doctors and maintaining a personal health log. As a team, we can give breast cancer, a run for its money. God bless and good luck to all taking the breast cancer",3
"I was diagnosed with LCIS 31/2 years ago, and have been taking Tamoxifen for 3 years now.  LCIS is Lobular Carcinoma in situ, a precursor to breast cancer. At first the side effects were severe hot flashes and night sweats.  The night sweats have subsided, but I still get very bad and frequent hot flashes. However, I am also in menopause, so it is hard to figure out whether all of the hot flashes can be attributed to the drug.  For the past few weeks I have experienced a constant low grade headache and pains in the back of my calves.  I went to my regular doctor, and she said I am retaining a little bit of fluid in my ankles and calves.  I am also fatigued and depressed.  Now that I read these comments, I see that these symptoms can be a side effect of this drug.  I have an appointment with the oncologist next month, and I will report these new side effects to him.  Isn't getting older just great?",4
"I put effective because in 2 years of taking the ""half dose"" (10mg) I have remained cancer free. I however have not felt like myself since the week I started it. I have anxiety (added Ativan to my drugs) hot flashes and mood swings (added Effexor 75 mg) but I still have had almost all of the side effects listed. Eyes have trouble focusing, but I do not need glasses. Bone/joint aches even though I workout 5-6 days per week and do yoga. Zero sex drive - and this was not the case before. Very hard time losing weight. I will do my best to stick it out for 5 years, but have told my oncologist that is it. I cannot do this for another 5 - quality of life is just as important.",4
"I had a lumpectomy with nodes removed and was told I was cancer free.  As a precaution, had radiation but no chemo.  Then I was put on Tamoxifen.  This medication got progressively worse as I took it.  During my two months of taking the medication, I experienced chills, night sweats, extreme spike in sugar readings, aches and pains -- so bad I could not make it from room to room, face rash, etc.  I thought I was going to die.  My vision deteriorated so fast on this medication, I was afraid I was going blind.  Headaches were bad.  Mood swings, maybe just because I felt so horrible, were extreme.  My doctor insisted I still keep taking it, but I can't.  Been off for over a month now and still plagued with side effects but they have been lessening with time, and am getting stronger.  I am really afraid of returning breast cancer (or worse) but taking this again is not an option.  Quality of life was not there, I was turning into a vegetable.  Don't know what to do.  ",1
"I was diagnosed with stage 0 DCIS in July of 2013.  After participating in a drug study I had a lumpectomy in November of 2013.  I then started 33 radiation treatments.  After which I started Tamoxifen.  I lasted 35 days of taking 20 mg each day.  I have severe hot flashes, nausea, bone pain and hardly any sleep.  I spoke with the dr and he wanted me to stay on it.  I had to dig deep within me but I stopped taking it.  I cannot function.  Think long and hard about this medicine.",2
I been on this med since january 2014  I had hot flashes which slowed down alot.I have muscle aches and then my lining was thick so 3 weeks ago i had a dnc now i got my period heavy again.I am going to gyno today to talk to her i want off of this i havent felt the same since taken it.I was stage 1  my limpnodes were removed all good.I really thought u dont get your period on this meds.I am 54 years old had breast cancer 2013.so far so good.And just started getting my period again it horriable.That it sooo heavy.....oh well thats my story,4
"I am 37 and have been taking T for 3 1/2 years. My dr told me he is going to have me take T for longer than the standard 5 years. All of my scans since surgery and treatments have been clear. I have heard a lot of bad reviews on this medication but I have not had bad side effects. Very rarely, I will have mild hot flashes. I have also had some weigh gain,but not enough to make me stop taking the meds.  I am premenopausal so I don't know if that makes a difference.",5
I took Tamoxifen for 5.5 yrs for treatment of breast cancer after a mastectomy.  The only side-effect I noticed was that my post-menopausal hot flashes were a little more frequent.  No big deal. Don't be scared off by all the negative posts; I think generally only people with bad experiences post.,5
had several fevers over 101 and had excruciating bone pain all over making it difficult to sleep or get up from sofa.,4
"I stopped Tamoxifen in Dec after taking for 5yrs (diagnosed with LCIS with ALH). I would take Tamoxifen again even though I had to deal with some of the side effects mentioned in other posts. I had weight gain (now losing), leg and even toe cramps have almost stopped, fuzzy brain seems to be better (learned to take a lot of notes), still have occasional night sweats but they could be age related, and vaginal dryness has improved. I had some joint pain the first couple of years but it is gone. Every time I heard ""no changes"" after my mammogram, including one 6months after stopping Tamoxifen, made the five years of side effects worthwhile.",4
Blurred vision and dimensia,3
"I am a 57 year old male who has been taking T for almost 5 yrs. my oncologists (2) now want me to take it for another 5 yrs. I just can't do it! Weight gain (30 lbs), depression, loss of sex drive, achy joints, hot flashes, fatigue-should I go on? Have decided to stop the medication and see what happens! Have read a lot of reviews from women but none from men.",4
"I have recently had a nodule removed and it was benign, however, I've been diagnosed with ductal hyperplasia.  Surgeon sent me to an oncologist who wants me to take Tamoxifen.  I'm scared to death of the side effects.  I can probably deal with hot flashes, but not mood swings, possible blood clots and weight gain (I'm already 20 lbs overweight, trying to lose with diet and exercise), anyway..I still have not started it and will be seeing my oncologist again next week, I'm sure she won't be happy with me, but as I said I'M SCARED TO DEATH TO START due to some of side effects I've read about. I'm sure I will have to eventually give in, but would prefer to have mammo more frequetly to see what happens in area around surgery.",1
I have been on med since Nov. 2013. I have gained weight & a ton of inches around my middle. I sometimes feel lethargic & my mood swings are terrible. I want to quit taking it really bad. My vision blurs on occasion & headaches occur out of the blue. I have never been one to have headaches. Just not sure what to do. Have explained to my doc but she still wants me to keep taking it.  Getting very discouraged......,3
my   face & hands have a rash & swelling after being in the sun. Has anyone else had this side effect from Tamoxifen?  I just started taking it. My dr said not a side effect of drug.,3
I hate this medication. The mood swings and hot flashes are terrible. The only way I can tolerate it is to take something for anxiety. I am considering stopping it.,2
"I AM 64 I HAVE BEEN ON THE DRUG FOR 2 1/2 YEARS NORMAL I WOULD NOT TAKEN THIS DRUG BUT THE OTHER DRUGS CONTAIN STERIOD, SIDE EFFECTS HOT FLASHES NIGHT SWEATS PAIN IN THE LEGS I HAVE NOT THOSE SINCE MY 50'S I HAVE BEEN OFF THE DRUG FOR 2 MOS BECAUSE I HAD RETINA SURGERY HAD TO BE FACE DOWN FOR ONE MONTH I DIDNT WANT TO DEAL WITH SIDE EFFECTS GUESS WHAT WENT AWAY THE DRUG CAN FORM CRYSTALS IN THE RETINA SO NOW I HAVE TO SEE MY RETINAL DOCTOR TWICE A YEAR NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICES EYES OR CANCER RIGHT NOW I AM VISUALLY IMPAIRED DUE  TO RETIONA PROBLEMS IN BOTH EYES",1
"I was diagnosed with BC June 2013 and caught very early. Been taking Tamoxifen (T) since then and follow up mamo is clear so far. Gave Effective rating 4 stars since its early yet. I have minor issues, but I don't believe they are T related since I had them before taking it. Symptoms are hot flashes, achy bones/joints, trouble with sleeping at times. Think its just menopause and also believe its not enough vitamin D and calcium.  Taking the Vit D and Cal does help but it takes time.",4
"HELLO,I'M 42 YEARS OLD DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER,HAD BOTH BREAST'S REMOVED IN AUG/2013,HAD CHEMO AND FINISHED IN DEC/2013.STARTED TAMOXIFIN IN JAN/2014 AND I HAVE BEEN MISERABLE.MY JOINT'S HURT,I'M GAINING MORE WEIGHT WHICH MAKES ME EVEN MORE MISERABLE,I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEX AND SO WORRIED ABOUT BLOOD CLOT'S FORMING.NOT SURE IF I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE IN TAKING THIS MEDICATION.I AM STILL SMOKING AND BATTLE THIS EVERY TIME I LIGHT UP.I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE SMOKING BUT JUST FEELING LIKE I HAVE NO MORE INNER POWER TO QUIT,I GUESS I JUST NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT MY FEELINGS AND PERHAPS THERE IS SOMEONE GOING THROUGH THE SAME ISSUES.I FEEL AT TIMES THAT I JUST WANT TO WAKE UP FROM THIS NIGHTMARE AND GO BACK TO MY OLD LIFE.",2
Hello my name is Carrie. I am 33 years old. I started taking this med. Two years and two month's ago. what I would like to know is if there is anyone out there in my age range? I can say for me at my age it has been a world wind of emotions. I'm also a high risk in my family pool when it comes down to breast cancer. All comments are welcome to help me go thru the next 3 yrs.,3
"During a mammogram in 2012 DCIS was found, at age 63. A lumpectomy on R. breast, followed by 6 wks. of radiation therapy. Stage O, Lymph nodes were clear. Tamoxifen 20mg. recommended for 5 yrs. I would get a hot flashes within the hour of taking the medication, and my cheeks become red. Last for a short time only. I noticed within the last month, unexpected pain on my front thigh, at times it shots down to the knee, and the front to the front of my calf. I definitely have mood swings, lost interest in sexual desire, and pray that this medication doesn't cause any permanent health issues. I have been very active, and still are, other then slowing down some. I will share my symptoms with my doctor on the next visit. My concern is, would tamoxifen cause permanent damage. I read some of the symptoms from others, who said they developed O.A., don't know if they had arthritis to begin with, if so, did it worsen? I hope to feel back to feeling good again once I finished my treatment. ",2
"I have been taking Tamoxifen for about 6 months. I was on Evista for 2 years, but was having severe leg cramps. I also have type 2 diabetes. I have been having problems controlling my blood sugar levels. I think this is a side effect of taking the tamoxifen. Both my primary doctor and my oncologist do no seem concerned. I am still experiencing leg cramps but not as severe. I also have vaginal dryness and itching. I don't know if I want to continue taking this medication.    ",2
"In April 2014, I will have been on Tamoxifen for 5 years. Many side effects. Mostly I have gained weight, 30 lbs., which makes me feel depressed. Also, libido is nonexistent and cataracts are beginning to form. Oncologist wants me to go another 5 yrs. Must decide if the side effects are worth it. Don't want to go through chemo and radiation again, either.",5
I feel pretty bad on tamoxifen.  The hot flashes and chills haunt me all night. I feel very sad and empty since taking it. My joints hurt and body ache. Really hate this medication.,3
"Invasive cancer into lymph nodes and DCIS, ER Positive, left mastectomy. Stopped taking Tamoxifen after 3 yrs. due to many side affects. Weight gain (15 lbs), rash on face, severe dizziness, fatigue all day long, achy joints, foggy brain, blurry eyes and diagnosed w/cataracts. I've started Fareston, so far okay.   ",3
this medication has worked for me and i feel better now thnxs God,5
"Don't let some of these reviews scare you, like they did to me! I have been on Tamoxifen for 9 months now (just had my clean 1-year mammogram yesterday!) and I have not experienced hot flashes, mood swings, aches and pains, sleep deprivation or weight gain. The only side effect has been a slight increase in triglycerides, which scared me into cutting back on sugar, and as a result, I've lost 20 pounds. It's all good!",5
"I have been on this drug for almost three years and the hot flashes have slowed, but have not stopped. My bones ache, especially in my feet in the mornings. I also have gained 20+ pounds and am so moody. Ugh! Thinking about going off drug. Also can now eat eggs. Before I was intolerant to them. And I get muscle cramps in obscure muscles, (ankles, side of foot). I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this.",3
"This drug has made my emotions go into over-drive, which brings about stress headaches and depression.",5
"I have been taking tamoxifen for two yrs,I had chemo a bi-mast, I haven't had many side  effects, Some hot flashes. but nothing that  interfered with daily routine.",5
just got on it. I am a male with a slightly enlarged and tender left breast. I had a mammogram done and had bloodwork done. My dr's concluded that there were no cancerous or active cancer cells present. ,3
"Was diagnosed in February 2010 with Breast Cancer in left breast only. Had lumpectomy and sentinel node removed. No cancer in the node. Radiation for 6 weeks and Tamoxiphen prescribed for 5 years. Have been taking this medication for 3 years and hot flashes have mostly passed. Was going thru menopause already so periods stopped after the first few months of taking it. Have increasing pain in my knees and feet, some headaches, have gained about 10 pounds and have lost that sex drive and energy that most of the others have talked about.I also am experiencing blood capilaries very close to the skin on my forearms (just a scratch will bring the blood to the skin and sometimes bleed.) I am overdue for appt with ontcologist but need to make an appt to discuss this.  ",3
"My wife is just starting but afraid of side effects.  Found to have atypical lobular hyperplasia, been putting it off for 4 years. Just started today.  Anyone out there with ath and on the drug?  Results, side effects? ",2
"Unlike many women, I have had no adverse reactions to tamoxifen. Not one.  Nada.  No weight gain, night sweats, etc.  It has literally been as easy to take as a vitamin.  I was frightened by all the reviews but I needed to dive in.  Once I did...nothing.  No horrible side effects. No side effects at all.    ",5
"Been on for a little over a year, only side effect is irregular periods. Drs say this is due to my age, not the tamoxifen.",5
"Little input frp, Dr. om side effects. Can't feel with finger tiops, toes are are numb throughout half each foot. Don't know to continue after this series.",3
"I had a Stage 1 tumor. Only had to have lumpectomy, sentinel node, and 33 radiation treatments. I have been on Tamoxifen since March of 2011. Being of menopausal age, the night sweats I had previously became much worse. My oncologist recommended Effexor, which has helped with moods. However, I get up each morning achy, with pain in my knees and legs,sometimes my hands. Physically, I feel worse than I did when I started the Tamoxifen, but my oncologist hasn't recommended a change. In reading the reviews,I saw others with the same problems...glad to see it's not just old age!",4
"At first has overwhelming emotions. Those stopped after a few months. The night sweats were the worst-woke up many times every night drenched. I ended up with swimmers ear infection from the sweat. Tried multiple drugs to counteract but to little relief. After 2 yrs uterous thickened & got a cervical polyp the size of last joint on little finger. But no recurrence so far of breast cancer. I had partial mastectomy, sentinal lymph node showed cancer so removed all lymph nodes. No cancer after 1 node. After surgery had 7 weeks radiation, no chemo.",4
Started taking it 2 months after my bi lateral masectomy and 13 lymph nodes removal...Starting voimitng or feeling like I had to every morning...Once i vomit I felt immediately better..I could of handle that...It was the severe depression that made me go off the drug..Hard to function on a daily routine....My Va jj felt like a raisin..forget about feeling sexy or even the desire was difficult to fake...I had an exterme vaginal bleed5moths afterstartingwhichcausedmy blood cout to drop to 7.8 Hgb.....that was in Dec I havent taken it since....,1
"After being diagnosed with stage one ductal carcinoma of the breast last June, I proceeded to radiation therapy The lesion was small 6mm, and no lymph node involvement. They put me on a total Estrogen blocker, which I could not tolerate. Then in Dec.2012 I was put on Tamoxifen. I was totally miserable and wiped out. Prior to treatment I had been positive and so grateful my cancer had been caught early. I saw my oncologist 10 days ago, and he took me off Tamoxifen. I am slowly feeling better, really much better! They will follow me closely. Now I am questioning the need for radiation, as I am quite certain it has damaged my lungs. At my age I have to look at quality vs quantity! I have friends who have had no problems with Tamoxifen, they look at me as if I have five heads. It is what it is! I pray the cancer will not return, but I also need to live the life I have. So, I roll the dice! ",1
"I've had some hot flashes,however it's the irregular periods, which are very heavy, which are caused by a thick lining forming on my uterus, which is giving me a hard time. I have also experienced some blood clotting. ",5
6 months of this drug gave me severe depression. I had to get off drug because of the negative depresssion. See DR in 3 wks; it did not agree with me.,1
"I have been on this drug for one year now and the doc told me I have to take it for ten years.  I get achy in the hands and feet, have gained weight (20)lbs. and hate the hunger it seems to give me cravings for calorie laden foods.  Not to mention feeing lethargic, tired and just plain miserable.  However, I take half the dose in the morning and Half at night and it seems to make a difference, not sure it might be all in my head but maybe not since it's less hitting my system at one time.",4
"I have all types of side effects and am considering telling my oncologist that i want to stop taking this drug. yes, i will take the risk of the cancer returning!!!!",4
"I was diagnosed with DCIS/Stage 0 in 2011.  Had a lumpectomy and declined the radiation after researching and talking to my breast specialist.  I took Tamoxifen for 13 months and discontinued after discussing with my oncologist.  The side effects out weighed the good.  I bacame over whelmed with mood changes and hot flashed which then I was put on Effexor to control those symstoms.  I have also experenced weight gain, low energy. NO libedo and insomnia.  I have now been diagnosed with Osteoarthritis (OA) which is arthritis in the joints.  After researching this it can be caused from menapause which your body is put through like symtoms of menopause.  I believe this is from the Tamoxifen.  I am putting my health in the Lords hands.  I am now off the Tamoxifen and slowing coming off of the Effexor.  I have been off the Tamoxifen for a week and half and now have my life back.  My energy level has returned and leibdo back on track.  Plese do your research on this and talk to your physician. It really depends on the Stage you were diagnosed.  Several other ladies I have talk to that took Tamoxifen are also experiencing OA in the hands.  Research is the key.",1
"Been taking this drug for 6 months & don't notice the side effects others have talked about. I do get hot flashes but not very bad & I was already dealing with those anyway. As far as effectiveness, hard to say. Won't really know until after the 5 years & the cancer doesn't return. ",3
"I was diagnosed with DCI in Situ in Oct 11, had a lumpectomy in Nov 11 and started my radiation treatments the first week of January. I too have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years. Before reading anything about Tamoxifen, I had no ill feelings about taking the hormone pill to prevent the cancer from recurring. I was given a list of 'possible' side effects from my Oncologist and after reading some of the reviews on here, I am really fearing taking the pill. I've suffered from migraines in the past and that would be the one deal-breaker for me over all other side-effects. (They were really extreme and I don't want to experience that level of pain again.) I know everyone is different and normally won't experience the same side-effects, but after reading the comments on here - I'm seeing a lot of the same problems/issues.  Really apprehensive about starting Tamoxifen now.  ",1
"Been on T for about a year, no side effects, so far. Worried about them, but none to date. Periods out of whack, but dr says it was time anyway.",5
"2 Lumpectomy (right breast), radiation, started Tamoxifen in Jul, nausea passed after 30 days, hot flashes, night drenches, severe insomnia, joint pain (hands/legs), weight gain (20), fatigue, mild vision issues. Started super antibiotics in Dec for infected cyst in breast, 10 days later intense spells lasting 20-25 mins with the following symptoms began, happened 2-4 times a day mostly in the evening (heart palpitations, loss of balance, dizziness, blurred vision, chg in distance vision, extreme pressure behind face/eyes, cognitive disruption (speech/processing data), headaches, elevated blood pressure. Drs ruled out everything else, oncologist determined it was the Tamoxifen and stopped it, 3 weeks later the symptoms are lessening but still present. Have read a great deal more ref this drug during the past several weeks and do not wish to restart. Oncologist told me Thurs he will not put me back on this drug, we will try something else in a month when I am better. I am 51 and have never had any drug sensitivities before this ever, very strong system. ",3
"I have been on tamoxifen for almost 2yrs and have experienced weight gain which I hate because I have never been this heavy in my life. Also, some joint pain,hot flashes. Can't wait for this to be over!",4
"Depression that I've not felt for years.  I take Effexor, Trazadone and Depakote.  ",3
Since I started taking this drug in May 2011 my triglicerides have gone through the roof...so much that my oncoligist wants me to switch to arimidex ,5
"I will finish 5 yrs of T. at the end of Dec! Was already a 3x cancer survivor (all different), so very scared of reoccurrence. Experienced most of what everyone else has had. Worst for me is joint pain, especially in my hands! It hurts to write my name. And no sleep: it is 2:15 AM and I still have not gone to bed!!! December can not get here fast enough for me! ",3
good and  troublefree,4
"In December 2011, I was diagnosed with Stage 1 estrogen positive. I had a double masectomy in January with the removal of 5 lymph nodes.  I was fortunate enough where I did not have to have chemo or radiation.  So, tamoxifen has been it for me.  I've been on tamxifen for 6 months now and am experiencing every side effect - mood swings, hot flashes, swollen ankles/feet, anxiety, weight gain, change in eye sight, etc.  I'm just now coming to the conclusion its the medication. We'll have to see where this journey takes me....",4
"Hi everyone! I am 35 yrs old and last year end of march I have diagnosed with stage 1 node negative hormone positive breast cancer. I had my tumor removed from my breast(left)and I had 4 cycle of chemo and 21 session of radiation. I am taking tamoxifen since 2011 October, my doctor put me on for 3 yrs because we want to have a baby before I turn 40. we have 12 embryos frozen waiting for the time to get approval from my doctor about pregnancy. I have not experienced any hot flushes or night sweats and weight gain (yet). however I am experiencing fatigue and bone pain especially my feet, my heels, my ankles and my lower legs.. and noticing some spider veins on my upper legs as well.. I am also experiencing some memory issues here and there too. I am still having my period but not as much as I used to be.I think the positive side effect I am experiencing is it's slowing&thinning down my bodily hair growth which I am not complaining at all lol. and I don't think it is affecting my hair growth looks like it's growing normally. I am just hoping  that all those aches and pains will eventually go away. because sometimes it affecting my quality of life.                    ",4
"I had a lumpectomy, radiation, and chemo then started the tamoxifen for what was supposed to have been 5 yrs.  It was like being in menopause for years, night sweats, extreem mood swings, poor memory, and all the physical aches.  After 3 years I told my dr. some things are worse than death & that was living on this drug for 2 more years.  I believe tamoxifen has no merit.  I believe the help is chemo & radiation.  I am 21 years chancer free.  DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG.",1
except for the hot flashes,5
"I haven't read all the reviews of this medicine but about 20 most recent ones, think I'm the youngest.  I was diagnoised in Aug 2011, did chemo, lumpsectomy with 27 lyphnodes removed, just completed radiation June 1, I was prescribe Tamox in march but didn't actually start taking til April, I was a lil skeptical about taking this med so still not taking it as should I take it on MWF instead of everyday but I still experience the leg joint pains, hot flashes (not as severe as when I was on chemo), headaches (didn't realize they were from the med til I read reviews), tiredness (thought that was from radiation).  I feel like older lady, because of the pain i feel of getting up or sitting down notice it alot in knees & heel of my foot. I also suppose to be on this pill for 5 yrs...gotta be a better alternative, why does every medicine you take have side effects....",3
"I took this medication 2009 - 2011 for dcis. I had 2 mini strokes and took myself off this medicatiion and changed doctors, who told me I did the right thing by quitting the tamoxifen especially after having a mini stroke and possibly should never have been put on it. Went through 33 radiation treatments prior to taking this which made my white blood cell count low, which was another reason I should not have been put on it. He said what I had been thru was overkill treatment for DCIS.  I think it affects your mental outlook permanently. ",3
tired and fatigue,3
"I am a six year survivor, just finished up my 5 years on tamoxifen. The side effects were tolerable considering the alternative. I found taking it at night was better, also, take the Effexor - it's amazing how much it helps. I am now on Femara for another 5 years and will stay on Effexor throughout these 5 years. I hate being on medication but I want to see my adult sons succeed in their lives. Stay as active as you can, the more exercise you can get the better you will feel. ",5
"I was also saddened to read that so many of us are struggling with the side effects of taking this medication. I have 3 1/2 more yrs to take it & am wondering how I am going to get through it... The side effects were gradual but now they are full blown...fatigue, depression, hot flashes, joint pain. I too have lost my pep in my step. My onco gave me Effexor but I am afraid to take another med. I am trying to exercise more to counter the depression.",5
"I had minor side effects--leg cramps which subsided with time.  But then I started feeling lousy--no appetite, weight loss, nausea, no energy, fatigued.  My liver enzymes were sky high--AST 696, ALT 808.  They have taken me off tamoxifen.  I have been off of it for one month and both values are in the 200's.  They are continuing to monitier me every other week.  Oncologist has decided not to put me back on it even when the liver returns to normal, and I agree!",1
"I be having headache at time, feeling sick, and know having hot flashes.",5
"I am so saddened to read that other women are experiencing similar symptoms as myself - lethargy, mild depressive mood, night sweats, weight gain - I have lost the pep in my step.  Unsure if chemo treatment 2 years ago caused these changes, or the ongoing tomaxifen.  I don't want breast cancer again so I take it every morning, it is real, but worry about what impact it has on my life and relationships for 5 years ???",5
"Am a survivor, 1 year and 7 months now. I had a lumpectomy, lymph node disection which tested negative-cancer hasn't spread, then radiation. No chemo though dr said if the cancer comes back then chemo will definitely be done, which I dread. Am taking tamoxifen for 1yr 5mos and will do so for 5 years. There's night sweats, insomnia, leg cramps-this really painful, fits of depression, vaginal discharge everyday, always feeling tired...lost 20lbs on the first 2 months 'cause I was terrified that anything I eat would kill me, so I quit the sodas, canned and preserved foods, sweets, rice, breads ... losing weight was maybe good at first, but my taste buds were so sad and I was miserable. Since then I gained back 10 lbs, started eating more, though the occasional cheating on the sweets not good as this feeds the cancer...so far so good ... take care of yourselves, especially watch the diet.",4
"I am experiencing serious hot flashes that last for hours. If I am active, even walking around the mall I begin sweating and it takes me until I can sit,and get in a very cool place before the sweating will stop. I don't know if there is something I can do to  help this problem or not but it is very annoying.",4
"I have been taking tamoxifen 2.5 years and I just don't know when enough is enough?  I have suffered severe insomnia, extreme fatigue, been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, I can't eat, I am completely nonfunctioning.  I think about suicide everyday.  I work with my doctors and am on a high dose of effexor.  They have tried everything they can think of and nothing is helping me.  I'm just giving up hope and I have no quality of life.  Is it time to quit tamoxifen?",1
I get up wih a headache everyday. What ca I take that will make it go away,5
"Wrote a review in 08/2011; It's been almost a year on T & so far so good.  The weight gain has not happened; the pain in the legs have subsided; sex drive & exhaustion I believe is just an ordinary part of life; the hot flashes are still there, but seem to only happen right after I take the T.  I take it in the evening around supper and have hot flashes on and off all night; I will report however, that my lining of my uterus has thicken and had a DNC last month; would really like have all that removed so that isn't a concern but have to follow protocol before surgery can happen.  Again, it's a simple solution to prevent breast cancer so I will continue another four years!",3
"Small benign breat tumor; lumpectomy & sentinel node procedure (all negative-Thank you Lord!); 30 radiation trtmnts (then we went to Disney World :-) I was hesitant to go on as concern of weight gain, and I'm already battling weight. But finally decided to try based on Dr saying I could go off immediately if desired. WELL, the only bad side effect I experienced was I noticed hair thinning (but unnoticeable to others). AND, a ""good"" side effect - I LOST weight! And I was not experiencing anything other adverse that would be of concern toward that. HOWEVER, after about 7-8 mths the Dr who prescribed me Wellbutrin (Bupropion 300mg/day) said that a study indicated the Wellbutrin would negate any affect of the Tamoxifen (NOT harmful just negate) so I went off it. My hair improved but unfortunately my weight went up (not drastically but there was a difference when on or off Tamoxifen). So as far as the Effectiveness rating, I couldn't really tell as not on long enough but I had to pick a rating so went 'middle-of-the-road'?",3
I don't like taking this medication. My body has never been the same. My joints ache and my bones feel sore.I have bad hot flushes. Although I have a choice I will continue to take this medication.It has been 2yrs have 3 to go which I will continue. I have heard in the USA research has been done stating that Tamoxafen should be taken for 7yrs not 5yrs I'll consider that when the time comes. ,5
"Lethargy, loss of appetite",4
i feel that this drug is working very well for me although the hardest thing for me are the hot flashes that comes along with taking this drug. also i do experience a little eye pain/blurred vision which could be side effects from other medications/illnesses. so far so good. i have one year &four months left on this drug. i am beating this disease!,4
im tuinol am i feel like it hasnt help me!is there any other treatment to prolong my life,2
I am on tamoxifen for 5 months now.Diagnosed July 2010.Had removal of 6 limphs and there after chemo x 16.The removal and construction at once after that..The results was most satisfactory.Did not loose my breast and it looks quite normal.I am very gratefull for that.Radiation for 7 weeks every day followed.Started Tamoxifin in Sept 2011.I am gaining weight and struggles with fatigue and energy levels low.Hot flashes severe.,3
"I have been on Tamoxifen for almost 1yr. I take it for prevention. I have had hot flashes, a little bit of nausea and have recently been experiencing joint pain. These are symtoms I will deal with as I had an MRI and MAMMO that finally came out ok. I am pre-menopausal and I guess there aren't alot of us out there on this med. I wish everyone luck in what seems to be a long journey.",4
"Left masectomy in March 2010 with lymph node removal on the left side; side effects of tamoxifan are weight gain; hot flashes, my oncologist put me on gapapenten to stop the side effects and it works like a dream. I can sleep at night, I have NEVER gained weight in my life, but have gained 10 pds since being on tamoxifican.  I do not believe it does not cause weight gain as everyone else has the same side effects. I wish there was an alternative for peri menopause women, and hope it is effective, will see.",3
"I just read about 50 of the reviews and I'm so scared to take this medication.  It's been over one month since my radiation, I just went to see the doctor yesterday who is trying to talk me into taking Tamoxifen.  I already take Celexa and read in the reviews it does not help Hot Flashes, I'm 52 so weight is already getting to be a problem, I have not gone through menopause but feel like I'm about to start, ugh...I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm as brave as a lot of you to try it, I feel like this medication is so wrong. ",1
"The pill is very simple to take however the hot flashes, mood swings, pains, irritability, and memory loss gets me down. You gain weight and at that time you start to feel depressed.",5
Depressed and a lot of nausea,3
Started taking after a great deal of thought 3 months post lumpectomies. No problems other than hot flashes for year #1. Beginning year #2 have bursitis and severe shoulder pain for 10 months. Decided to stop taking as the shoulder pain was interferring with my work as a P.T. and trainer.,3
"In the beginning I didnt want to take Tamoxifen, I had read many horror stories and it kind of put you off. Anyway I have now been taking this medication for 3 years, side effects are weight gain and joint pain and hot flushes, but I truly believe its a small price to pay if these tablets stop the cancer coming back. I am losing weight after joining a slimming class, I take pain killers for the joint pain.......all in all after my initial kicking and screaming about taking Tamoxifen...I wouldnt be upset if I had to take them the rest of my life!",4
"June 2005 at age 41 Stage 2A 4 rounds of chemo. 6 weeks radiation. I took Tamoxifen for the standard 5 years. Dr. let my stop taking this drug April 2011 and, now in Oct. my mamo showed 2 tumors. I am back on Tamoxifen for another 5 years! Can't live without it, can't live with it! What can you do? HATE the weight gain, the indigestion, and just feeling like a 70+ woman when, I am 47. Want to feel good enough to get all I can out of life! Because life is way to short!",4
"Age 42 Breast cancer multi focal, Stage IIA two lympnodes positive, Mastectomy Nov 2010, AC+Taxol Jan 2011-June2011. I chose to wait 3 months before starting Tamoxifen on Oct 24, 2011. So far so good. I cannot identify the side effects directly related to tamoxifen because small side effects from Chemo still there a little bit. Hot flashes and joint pain from CHemo subsided and do not return with Tamoxifen. No bone pains or headaches. I have some sleeplessness but dealing with it by taking Tamoxifen in the morning, only one coffee in the morning, and dringking Camomile warm tea before bedtime. This is helping so far. Every other couple days, I will take 1-2 capsules of valarian roots to help get a good night sleep. You are not supposed to take this every day. Noticed slight weight gain but control with healthy eating and less portion of carbs at dinner time. No fried food. Big breafast and lunch with increase in vegetables and fresh fruits. I do not exercise! In fact,I notice a light weight loss this morning! I read a lot of reviews about this drug and took some preperation prior to starting Tamoxifen. I am now taking 1 Omega-3 in the morning, 1 multivitamin (1 a day woman) at lunch time and 1 calcium with D3/Mag/Zinc & 1 Omega-3 at Dinner time. I think this keeps me from having bone and joint pain and also keep blood clots which cause leg pains away. For those who have a lot of side effects, you might want to consult your doctor to see if these vitamins will help you. Good luck everyone! I hope my information helps!",5

"The side effects of Tamoxifen are terrible, especially the weight gain--10 pounds a week the first five weeks! The headaches were also migraine-level but did not respond to treatment.  I was removed from treatment on this medication because of these and other side effects after 5 weeks, so its effectiveness cannot be really examined accurately.",1
"Diagnosed at age 41,DCIS Stage IIA, 2 lymps positive, 4 AC 12 Taxols went well, no problem, done at the end of June 2011. Joint stiffness, hot flashes and numbness from Taxol. Got better after Chemo. Start Tamoxifen Sept 26th, 2011. So far so good. I just don't know when the side effects supposed to hit me. Joint stiffness still here, hot flashes has somewhat disappeared. Still easily tired. Sex drive gone before dignosed anyway. I don't feel as sharp as I used to be. A small weight gain I guess but I think it's also related to getting older and after 2 kids. I wonder if I don't have side effects now, does that mean I won't? Praying.",5
"Hot flashes Side effect of this medicine. So bad I can't  sleep,rest. Hope they will soon get better.",3
HAVE BEEN TAKING TAMOXIFEN FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AFTER A TOTAL MASTECTOMY FOR BREAST CANCER. MINIMAL SIDE EFFECTS OTHER THAN HAIR TEXTURE CHANGES,4
Have been on this med since April 2008 after lumpectomy and 6 weeks radiation. Experienced weight gain. Hot flashes are getting less but bone and joint pain getting worse!  May ask doctor if I should discontinue at next appointment.  Don't want to risk the positive reasons for taking this med though,3
"Started T; took it for a year; the pain in the leg was so severe the dr stopped it; ran test; started it again in May, 2011; the pain has returned but not as bad; hot flashes have increased; this time it seems to make me more tired than usual, but not sure if the medication has caused this; loss of sex drive, but the side effects don't mention women in this area just men; so going to watch and document and compare; im hoping this medication is like other medications that is taken for a long period of time--either the side effects subside or one grows accustom to them....overall, I would rather prevent the breast cancer and sweat a little.  I was fortunate that my tumor was found in the early stage and most of it was removed when the biospy was taken; 6 wks of radiation and then 5 years of this...pretty simple   will make the effort to take this medication to make my life better/before breast cancer, hodgkins visited and had a stem cell transplant to rid myself of it; so Tamixofen doesn't seem to be a big deal to help prevent breast cancer!",3
"Stage 1 invasive BC. 2 Lumptectomies and 33 radiation treatments. I have taken Tamoxifen since February and feel awful. Bone/Joint pain; couldn't think clearly so Dr. put me on Clonidine. Not many hot flashes, but I don't sleep well; I now have age spots; I just feel old and rundown. I walk everyday so I do stay active, but the bone pain makes it difficult.Have had some depression but I am peri-menopausal so that could contribute. Not sure I will stay with Tamoxifen for 5 years. Afraid I will age another 20 years in 4 1/2. If my cancer wasn't caught so early and my chances of reoccurance were greater, it might be worth it. ",5
"I am 34 years old and was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast Cancer on June 03, 2011.  I started taking Tamoxofin on June 04, 2011. My body immediatly responded to the medication. I noticed the nodes in my breast were shrinking. The only side effect I had was the hot flashes. After about three weeks, the hot flashes stopped. I am very satisfied with this medicine. Im very hopeful for my future and recovery.",5
"Have taken this for a year; problems occurred; did some testing; re-prescribed; was off this for approximately 8 months; since returing to this the side effects appear a little worse than the 1st time; I get up almost nightly with horrible leg pain; the weight gain has been significant and I have even had the lap-band procedure; hot flashes has increased; and just tired beyond believe; however, i'm hoping after a six-month run it will all even out.  Willing to accept what is being offered so that breast cancer doesn't find it's way back to me.",4
 after four weeks experienced extreme fatigue to the point of having to use a walker.  It went on for  three weeks until I stopped taking the medication and it stopped.  Dr said he had never known anyone with these results. I am very sensitive to all medications so it probably was me and my system.,1
"Diagnosed with DCIS in July 2009.  Two lumpectomies then 6 weeks radiation.  Been on Tamoxifen for 1 1/2 years.  Weight gain, hot flashes, early menopause, leg/foot cramps.  Not fun but at least I'm alive.",3

"I've taken Tamoxifen from 2005 until now. I've had 5 years of clean tests. The only problem was a few more leg cramps. I did gain about 10 pounds, but only because I was not active.  Stay active and I don't think you will gain weight. Ask your Dr. about taking an Aspirin, if it will ease the worry of blood clots. I had DCIS in left breast, had an lumpectomy, MammoSite.",5
"Diagnosed with stage II at age 36 but I didn't panick. Went through 3 lumpactomies, then a mastectomy. Chemo for 5 months, then 7 weeks of radiation- I didn't panick. Then I was told I had to take Tamoxifen for 5 years - I panicked. I had all these horrible side effects envisioned... Finally I broke down and started taking them - and nothing happened! No side effects to talk about - a couple of days of being extremely thirsty. Weeks later - 2 depressed days. 6 months later - achy fingers which I don't even know if it's related to Tamoxifen... it's been 9 months and I haven't had a single hotflash. Just wanted to let people know that even though many get horrible sideeffects, it doesn't have to happen. You have to try it and see if it works for YOU.  ",4

"My Story: Stage III Breast Cancer in one breast, opted for Bi-lateral mast, 6 treatments chemo (TAC), 5 years of Tamoxifen (which I discontinued after the first month).  I was really stressing about whether or not to even start the drug but finally did so because ""Doctor knows best"".  Well, they don't.  They do the best they can and I'm grateful for them. But Doctors often recommend standard treatment for everyone (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc.), followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen.  Whether you take Tamoxifen or not your cancer could come back.  If they could tell me by taking Tamoxifen and dealing with the side effects that I would never get cancer again, I'd be the first one in line. But the truth is, there's no guarantee, so I'd like to make the choice about whether it's right for me rather than let a Doctor scare me into taking it.  Do your research about this drug before you make your decision ....I'm glad I did!         ",3
"Diagnosed with Stage IIIA Invasive Ductal Carc in right breast, elected Bi-lateral mast., Dr. said ""He got it All"", followed by 6 rounds chemo.  Pet scan showed no spread, no cancer anywhere else. Went on Tamox at oncologist urging, stopped after 3 weeks.  Too many hot flashes, ankle swelling, insomnia, plus anxiety over risk of serious side effects.  Not worth it. No guarantee cancer will not recur with this drug so not putting myself through it.",3
I have alot of hot flashes sometimes to the point of sweating.  I also have trouble sleeping.  I had bone a\pain in the beginning but that has vastly improved.,4
"Have been on T for 3 years and 2 months after lumpectomy and radiation with mammosite for early stage DCIS. Went into immediate menopause. Have always had some hot flashes, but the last 6 months they have increased to being almost unbearable. Started being nauseated all the time; swollen throat, muscle aches and being more fatigued. Don't know if these symptoms are from drug since I have been on it for awhile. Need something to help with the nausea and sore throat. Feel like I need to stay on it for at least 2 more years. Tired of feeling so bad lately.",3
"I taken Tamoxifen for (5) years after having stage (2) breast cancer 10 years ago.I underwent chemo & radiation at the time.Today,my breast cancer came back in my other breast.Thank God,It's a stage 0 & all that is reguire for me is ""radiation"".My concern today is after radiation I must ""orally"" take another Hormone Treatment for the next (5) years.I had terrible side effects in the past from taking Tamoxifen,mainly hot flashes,dryness with itching.I want to continue taking  some type of harmone treatment but I sure don't want any more increase of side effects.I'm now age 63 years of age & still occasionaly  sexually active.That was another side effect I didn't like.This happen 10 years ago,are their any new Harmone Replacements that I now can take besides Tamoxifen?Or will I have more increased side effects? I'm well past the menopause stage",2

My sister took the same dosage after her surgery and never had any problem.  I have been on the drug for one year.  I have had weight gain, and terrible hot flashes, many every day.

"I had Stage 0 DCIS, radiation treatments 8 weeks.  I've taken Tamoxifen for 16 months, and recently noticed weight gain (hips, stomach). I'm not sure if it is the drug.

"I was diagnosed with bilateral cancer in Jan. 2009 & was 46 at that time.  It was caught early; stages 0 and 1 (non-invasive LC & DC stage 1). I opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction & saline implants that followed half a year after my mastectomies.  When I first went on the tam., I was miserable with hot flashes, joint pain, a terribly broken out face, and I could not sleep at night.  My nephew had just committed suicide which did not help my emotional state... I went off the tam. until I saw my oncologist, who strongly encouraged me to go back on it.  He said side effects generally subside after a few months.  I have now been on tam. for 1 1/2 years.  For the past 6 months, I've had terrible pain in my calves & easily pull my calf muscles when doing any kind of exercise.  This has been hard for me because I like to be active (tennis, aerobics, biking)& I've put on weight since being on the med.  I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism after being on tam. for one year.  I was constantly cold & very fatigued - I attributed this to having 3 surgeries in 11 months.  I've now been on synthroid (75 mcg.) for 4 months & am feeling less tired & cold, but continue with the cramps/pulled muscles.  I struggle with staying on tam. - I feel as though my skin, face, & body have aged considerably in this short time.  I wonder how much of a risk there is for recurrence when there is little breast tissue left.  I feel my doctors are quite competent, & yet I wonder about their motives for pushing women to take tamoxifen.  If the muslce pain con't. & I can't figure out a way to treat it w/out more drugs, I am considering going off tam. altogether. ",3

Removed a few lymph nodes, found cancer in all, but did radiation on all of them as well vs removal of remainder. Completed treatment 2004, tamoxifen completed August 2009. I also had hot flashes, but I went thru immediate menopause so understandable. Also had severe leg cramps, weight gain and nails would not grow. They were rock solid before and were brittle and broke easily. Now that I am off, they grow normally. Also had memory loss and forgetfullness that has not gone away. Chemo related and tamoxifen enhanced. But I'm still here, so it's all worth it!",5

Terrible hot flashes, do not sleep thru the night, rash on face, hip pain, rib pain.  Oncologist took me off of it for six weeks to see if symptoms subside.  I feel vulnerable without it (the tamoxifen), hoping for an alternative drug.  I am peri-menopausal, so I understand some drugs will not work.  Wondering if removal of ovaries only option?",3
"I have experienced terrible hot flashes, memory loss, blurry vision, depression, and recently terrible legs cramp.  1-1/2 years down but 3-1/2 years to go.  Hope me and my family can make it.",4
"LCIS found with surgical biopsy in Aug 08. No residual. Went on Tamoxifen in Nov. 08. Had bad night sweats,aching hip joints, dryness. Stopped having periods. Had a kidney stone in Nov. 09 (no history previously) and catscan showed ovarian cyst (again, no history.) Went off T. and cyst resolved. Staying off this drug as it seems to do more harm than good for me.",2
"ER/PR stage 1 invasive treated with lumpectomy, chemo, short term radiation in 2008.  I was post-menopausal when diagnosed through my annual mammo. Following rads, I tried 2 separate aromatase inhibitors which caused depression, fatigue and severe body pain. Gave each a 3 month trial - gave up on each. Decided to do Tamoxifen. After 8 months, lots of hot flashes, severe depression and fatigue, I quit the tamoxifen with my oncologist's blessings. Because my oncoDX score was low medium and my cancer was caught so early, the tamoxifen would statistically only afford me an 2% improvement in absolute (not relative) risk of recurrence. (Did that make sense?) Anyhow, I hope I'm doing the right thing. I began feeling better the next day after quitting.   used to be positive, funny, a generally happy person. I had not been myself for 2 years with treatment and these hormone therapies! I am grateful to be alive and regaining my health, mental and physical.  ",1
The continuing hot flashes have been miserable-- up to 20 a day or more at times. They wear me out! ,3
"I had stage 0 DCIS diagnosed in Sep 09, after two lumpectomies had to have a mastsectomy to get get clear results. Luckily no radiation or chemo was needed. Now taking tamoxifen and thought there were no side effects. However, I do have bad leg/foot cramps and occassional memory lapse. Not sure if this is a side effect as I had the leg cramps before. ",5
diagnosed with stage 0 DCIS chose to have double masectomy taking tamoxifen 20mg,4
"After bilateral mastectomies I took Arimidex, but felt as if I had the flu all the time with severe muscle and joint pain. The onc. changed me to tamoxifen and I thought all was going well, but after several months I developed a blood clot in a deep vein. Now I'm on Aromasin and it's much harsher on my body. I wish I could take tamoxifen again, but can't take the chance of DVT again. ",3
i had DCIS and i am on tamoxifen and i am scared of all the side effects can you please help me.,2
"For the first time using this medication I had ache and pain all over my body, just like when I was on chemo. Now, I guess my system gets use to it, I am fine now. No complain.  ",4

"I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer Stage 1 On November 1, 2009. Lymphnodes negative---Estrogen Positive--Oncodyte Test was good---I scored 12 out of 100. this gives me a 9% Re-occurrnece. I had Lumpectomy surgery and 33 treatments of Radiation---The Radiation was great---I felt like I was in a tanning bed. Since I have been on Tamoxifen-20mg. I have had side effects such as night sweats, headaches, dizziness and blurred vision. I am losing weight instead of gaining weight--which is great! I saw my doctor for other options-he said I can have my ovaries removed which would give me options of Femera, Aromasin or Arimidex. I checked on the reviews and the side effects tend to be simular. My other option would be to take 10mg in the am and 10mg in the PM to help reduce the side effects during the day when I am working. The other option would be to reduce to 10mg per day or not to take it at all---If I don't take it all all I will go from a 9% reoccurence to 13.5% re-occurrence. My doctor stated that I am youung and still producing Estrogen in my body---I  have decided that if I want to live a long life, I need to take this medication and just deal with the side effects. I know this will effect my quality of life for 5 years---I pray every day this does not come back---if taking this medication and possibly not even working for the next five years---I will do just that---because my health is that important to me.

"I'm 48 was diagnosed with breast cancer. The side effects of Tamoxifin for me were weight gain, joints are painful and my face breaks out. Taking Effexor now and my hot flashes are completely gone. ",3
"I could not take Femara or Arimidex due to side effects. Severe joint pain, nausea, and dizziness.  On Tax for one yr. I took myself off a month ago. I have tired of feeling irritable, hair loss, weight loss (35 lbs.), joint pain, and insomnia.  I feel like I'm gradually returning to normal.  Haven't found an oncologist that I like or trust.  I am a trained medical scientist.  I do not feel the oncologists are truthful about side effects!",2

"I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in June, 2006.  I had mammosite radiation and 4 sesssions of chemo.  I've started Tamoxifen in October 2006 and switched to Arimidex in March 2008 but the side effects of Arimidex were terrible and switched back to Tamoxifen.  Overall the positives outweigh the negatives until I reach my 5 year in October 2011.  I've been able to deal with the hot flashes but the weight gain has been terrible and no matter what I do to lose nothing seems to work - it is very depressing.  However I keep telling myself that it is now only 1 1/2 years more and then i'm done.  Has any been successful with any diet to counteract T?",5
"Was diagnosed with DCIS 3/09, no chemo, no radiation (stage 0). Tamoxifen caused hot flashes & restlessness at night. Dr. prescribed 200 mg Neurontin (anti-seizure med) & I sleep like a baby,but am counting down another 4 years when I can stop it.  Also caused hair thinning, but no weight gain, joint pain, etc as described by some.",5

"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Sept 2007. I had a lumpectomy and 6 months of chemo and 6 weeks or radiation. I have been on Tamoxifen since May 2008. I have not had the hot flashes (I take a vitamin E tablet in the morning and at night to combat this), but have experienced leg and foot cramps. Overall, my experience has been good!",4
Before I started taking Tamoxifen I had read comments about how bad the side affects were.  I have been on the drug since 1/6/10 and have had NO side affects at all.,5
"Have not had many side effects from the medication, but I do have the start of a cataract (don't know if this is related to the tamoxifen), hot flashes that have caused a sleeping problem and problems with low back pain and joint pain.",4
"2 years ago I was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer with 1 postive lumph node on the left.  I had bilateral lumpectomies and then received 6 wks of radiation, no chemo.  I was initally perscribed Arimadex and took it for about 6 months.  I had to stop because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. My expercience with Tamoxifen has been leg/foot cramping mostly at night, joint pain, short term memory problems, depression and hot flashes.    Last month my oncologist suggested taking SAMe 400mg 2-4 times daily for depression and joint pain. I have also changed my diet to an antifungal diet recommended by Doug Kaufmann from knowthecause.com.  So far my joint pain is about 80% better and my energy and motivation has noticably improved.  Still having ocassional leg cramps at night but the hot flashes have decreased...not sure if it's due to the diet change or the SAMe.  Hope this helps someone! God Bless!!! ",4
I finished 6 1/2 weeks of radiation in October.  Started taking Tamoxifen in October and have not had monthly cycles. I've experienced extreme mucle spasms in my feet and legs. Considering removing my ovaries to get off of this drug. My concentration is off.,4

Gained 25 lbs. even while going to aerobics 3 times a week, weight lifting and walking 10 miles per week. Had to stop all this exercise due to pain. Been of T 7 days and symptoms are improving. I was told by my oncologist that effexor will interfere in the effectiveness of T. T is a miracle drug for some but at some point I had to make a choice between recurrence of cancer and quality of life and I only made the decision after much prayer and careful consideration and have left the rest up to my Lord Jesus. Each of you need to make a decision based on your individual results and I encourage you to stay with T if you can bear the side effects. ",1
terrible hot flashes and weight gain,3
"LCIS with 1mm invasive found with surgical biopsy. Lumpectomy showed no more invasive in the breast but lots of LCIS. Doctor was shocked to find 4 lymph nodes positive. Chemo followed. Then double mastectomies. Wanted to avoid the DIEP flap reconstruction so expanders were put in the same day. 5 weeks radiation. Have been on Tamoxifen for 3 months. First side effect noticed was my eyelashes were almost gone. Was scared to lose my hair again. Stopped T for 3 weeks but husband begged me to go back on it. Eyelashes are fully back. Main side effects since have been flushing, small headaches of short duration mainly around one eye, trouble sleeping, dizziness when suddenly sitting up or standing, no noticeable weight gain yet. I've read others comment on joint pain. I had achiness in my arms and legs after chemo. Had been drinking tons of water with Crystal Light as flavoring. It occured to my doc husband an uncommon side effect of the sweetener Aspartame is joint pain. Switched to Propel and the joint achiness immediately went away. Thought others would like to know this. Stay positive!!    ",4
49yr old diagnoised with stage2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Had 2 lumpectomies-no lymph nodes spread.

"Had mastectomy on one side with no node involvement. No radiation or chemo. I've been taking Tamoxifen for 5 years and am cancer free. The only side effect has been hot flashes.

"Well, no third Candid Glibrata infection. I took a 45 day break and went back on T on October 15th. Blood work excellent and bilateral mammo perfect after a Stage 1 , lumpectomy and radiaiton last spring. Now, I have cystites in my uterous which were picked up by a tansvaginal ultra sound. Will have a biopsy done in the office on December 23rd. This is supposed to be a common side effect of T. Who knows? The probitic acidopholous really, really works. I also take lots of Vitamin D as per my oncologist. Dexascan slightly better this year than last. Still have osteoporosous so when I switch to Arimidex in 2 years, I will go on Actonel or Boniva. T works on building up the bones differently. Too risky to take another bone med. now. ",5

I have really bad leg, muscle and joint pains since I have been on Tamoxifen for 3 years.  Also have lots of yeast infections and horrible itching quite often and hair thinning.  I'm glad to see that I wasn't prematurely aging!!!  A neighbor of mine was also on Tamox for 5 years and experienced the same things.  I was so relieved to hear that from her. My question to anyone is:  Do any of you have to be on pain medication for your pain?  My oncologist thinks that there is something else wrong because I have to have the pain medication to treat the pain.  He says that there isn't anyone else that has to take pain medication because of Tamox.  Sure would like to hear from any of you that have had to have pain meds.  Thanks again for each and everyone for your comments.",4
"It's amazing how this medication affects some people and not others.  I was one of the unlucky ones.  I took Tamoxifen for 6 weeks, and of the 20 plus side effects they list I saw about 15 of them along with a couple not listed.  Huge blood spots broke out under the skin on both legs, I lost about 20 lbs, and have never felt so bad in my life.  Words do not describe how this medicine made me feel. Cramping toes, unbelievable hot flashes, no appetite, extreme tiredness, fuzzy brained....I could go on.

"First of all want to let you all know that I am a 9 yr breast cancer survivor. Mastectomy and 5 months of chemo. I had terrible hot flashes and night sweats.  I did Tamoxifen for 4 years at which time my memory was so bad I was leaving the elctric burners on, on the kitchen range. I also lost a very good job because of my memory problems. (My doctor said no one could prove that it caused memory loss at that time anyway.)  I then went off of Tamoxifen on my own. (My husband insisted.) My B.C. was Estrogen positive and had already had a complete hysterectomy 2 years before; but now cannot take hormone drugs ever again. My memory improved a lot after discontinuing the Tamoxifen.  Originally I was told that my memory would improve about a year after chemo; but it did not.  Still have memory problems; drawing blanks on words and transposing words; ie: hot for cold, etc.  But yes, I am a survivor and thank God every day for the extra time I have been given!! God Bless you all as you go through this journey....",5
"Well, got over the Candida Glibata and am now on Acidopholis which desolves in the large intestine, supposed to work better. Back on the Tamoxifen October 115th.

"Just finished the first 6 months of the 5 year stint.  Hot flashes has been the worse sympton I have experienced.  Have had some weight gain, but uncertain if this is due to the medication or just knowing it could happen; Also, have had some cramping in my legs, but again, this also occurred before I began the Tamoxifen.  I have decided to see what the next 6 months bring and compare.  ",3
the worst thing ever.was on for 7 weeks sweating so bad then could not walk.if a drug can make yu not walk iys not going in my body..,1
"Have been on Tamoxifen for 8 mos. My BC was small enough that the dr. felt radiation was not necessary. My main side effect has been intolerable hot flashes. Tried Effexor generic and it made me sick. My dr. prescribed Megace. I was afraid to take it at first because it is mainly used for weight gain in HIV patients. However, their dose is 400-800mg. daily and I am taking 20mg. After two weeks, my flashes have completely stopped during the day. Do have a couple upon waking up so dr. said to take 20mg. at night. Side effects say possible sleeplessness so am holding off for the time being.  Overall, Tamoxifen is doing its job and I only have 4 yrs. and 4 mos. to go.....",5

"My doctor wanted me to take this medication because I had calcifications in my breast and he felt I had several other risk factors. I have been on taxoifen for almost 3 months.  I have had some depression which is very unusual for me.  Also I have had two urinary tract infections, a bacterial infection and vaginal soreness and flushing for the last 6 weeks.I had not had any of these problem before.  I have decided to stop taking Tamoxifen and see if this all clears up.  ",1
"After being on this drug for almost 9 months, I am in the midst of my second yeast infection in as many months. Of course it is Canndida Gibata and must be treated with Terconazole. What to do? My recurrance rate was 15% by doing nothing and 9 % with rad and Tam. I did 34 of radiation. I see the oncologist next Thursday. Everyone thinks I am bonkers but I googled Tamofifen + yeast infection and there it was! Anyone else have this problem?",5
"the first day i took thhis medication, i was got very sleepy, laid down for about an hour, and i woke up vomitingfor a long period of time , and was scared to take it agian until i consulted my docter. i then tried it agian a week later, and i have not had much sight effects except for the hot flashes.",4
vagina flushing,3
I've been on the drug for about two months. I've started to experience massive hailoss which has yet to stop. I'm pretty sure it's from the tamoxifen- has anyone else experienced this?,3
"I am suffering so much with joint pain. None of my doctors can tell me what is wrong. My hands look as if I am getting RA.Diagnosis was negative. My question is, Can Tamoxifen cause severe joint pain and deformity?",5
Taking Tamoxifen if this the same as taking Chemo?,3
Have been using this for many years but now appears to be affecting breathing.,4
I was put on Tamoxifen 7/2008 after a mastectomy. Leg & foot cramps/sleep sometimes good sometimes not.Dizzy about 2pm & cold flashes about 8 pm. Just started with ache in bones & muscles. I also found summer heat & outside activities bother me. Test coming back great .I feel some of the symptoms that others complain about is from forcing your body into menopause before it is ready.,4
"After taking Arimedex for 8 mos., I ask for a change in medication due to the side effects.(Muscle weakness, deep bone pain, fatigue etc.) I have not had these side effects with Tamoxifen, however, I have had some weight gain.  Is this normal?",3
"I have ADD. The symptoms increased dramatically when I started using tamoxifen.Had to stop taking it after 2.5 years. It felt like having fibro-myalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome at the same time. I was severely depressed and even contemplated suicide. Was crippled by arthritis, couldn't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes, became disoriented, emotionally unstable. I'm a clinical psychologist, Ph.D., but had to stop working because of symptoms. None of my doctors could tell what was wrong with me. Stopped taking it 3 years ago, and much of my cognitive functioning hasn't returned. I know many doctors who admit they won't treat a patient who won't take tam. This is unconscionable, as is the behavior of doctors who withhold discussing possible side effects for fear patient will refuse it. As far as I could find out, there has been practically no research on the cognitive side-effects. I think it is absolutely essential that these cognitive symptoms receive attention and research. Patients with ADHD MUST BE WARNED of possible side effects. This drug can ruin your life.",1
"I do have leg pain which is quite significant.I have to take pain meds for it. I also get hot flashes that are different from usual, it is a feeling of hot and cold all over my body. Hate it.",2
"Just started second month of Tamoxifen therapy. I learned to take it at bedtime due to nausea and slight dizziness if taken during the day. I do wake up sometimes after being asleep for about an hour,I get up and walk around the house until I feel I can try to lie down again. This doesnt help with being up at 6 am to go to work. Within past 2 wks I have developed left leg pain. Not sure what is causing this. Will report this to onocologist though. I am not a pill taker so I really don't like taking this med but it is said to cut my risk of developing breast cancer in half, I guess it is worth the risks.",2
"I am 52 yr old who had 1 lumpectomy in Oct 08 which showed LCIS,sent to oncologist who wanted me to have Breast MRI prior to starting Tamoxifen. Had that done in Jan 09, got called back for MR-guided core needle biospies x2 areas of concern. 1 came back DCIS,another lumpectomy in Feb 09 then 28 radiation treatments followed. Now into second month of Tamoxifen. I discovered early on to take at bedtime, however I do wake up and wander around the house at times. Not so good when I need to be up at 6 am to go to work. Occasional night and day sweats, (I am post-menopausal, so I thought that I had the night sweat thing behind me but they are back.) Become more easily fatigued, not sure whether to blame Tamoxifen, radiation, the stress of the surgery, the diagnosis or all of it! Most recently developed left hip pain with radiation down back of left leg. Not sure if this is something to worry about or not. Unilateral leg pain often symptom of deep vein thrombosis so I am going to call oncologist to report this to him. I do worry about taking the med then I worry if I don't take it there may be recurrence of cancer. It is a very confusing time in my life and I am a nurse of 33 yrs! One would think that I would have all the answers. I am trying to put faith and trust in my team of doctors,I know they are following the ""standard of care"". God bless all of you who are dealing with the same issue.This diagnosis has given my new insight as a nurse.",2
"I had invasive, Stage 1. I underwent 2 lumpectomies and 6 weeks of radiation before starting Tamoxifen. After taking this drug for 12 months I was exhausted and had nausea every morning that lasted through the entire day at times. Luckily my oncologist suspected liver damage and sent me to a liver specialist. Turns out my AST and ALT levels were steadily climbing. Four months later these levels were 10 times what they should be and I had developed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). I immediately stopped taking Tamoxifen but it took 6 months for my liver readings to return to normal. After consulting with my oncologist and radiologist we decided the risk to my liver was far greater than the risk of reoccurance. It's been almost a year now and I feel great!",2
"Had Breast Cancer July 07. Went through 2 surgerys and radiation. I started Tam in Jan 08 and have very little side effects. I do get fatigued, but I train horses so I am very physical. My night sweats are kept in control with 1000 IU's of vitamine E daily.",5
"Tam. on 3 yrs.  Side effects, overheating, weight gain, loss of breath, tired, can't exercise, face stays red for hours after exercise or being in sun.  Talking wiith doctor to be removed.  Sister and I both have had breast cancer.  High risk for her type XXXneg. I am DCIS. Sister was 39 yr. 1st time and has returned third time. I was 43 and 46 now.",4
"when I first start taking it I had a allergic reaction, swelling of the tongue,hard time swallowing, trouble breathing and ended up in the emergency room, but since then i haven't had any problems with it.",4
"I am greatful that there is such a drug out that can stop or slow down the estrogen in the breast to keep the cancer at bay, I am not pleased with the mood swings, irability and the not sleeping and feeling agitated all the time...then again I am not convienced that it is the medication that is causing this but rather the fact is that cancer causes deppression and to find out now that I was just prescriped an anti deppressent from my family doctor with hopes of getting back to my happy go lucky self I see that the two do not mix...so I will not be starting celexa 'what I was prscribed' but instead I will be calling back my family doctor and directing her to the site I found and see where we go from here! I have only been on tamoxifen for three months now, I had to have the surgery then Radiation and after that I was rather weak and had to rebuild my strenght so that they could remove my thyroid 'had multi gouiters on both sides 172 grams removed on the right side and 133 from the left, so large that the surgeon I decided on stated that mine was the largest he had yet to see and remove in the USA and he is very notable for his work, an artist of sort if I say so my self 'I have such a small scare that is hardly noticable that surprised me to high heaven!   So just back to working on this dang depresent state of mind in finding something that can be used with my tamoxfien!",5
"38 yr old had  Bi Lateral Mas Sept 08. This drug has made my life miserable. I am a mother of 2 young girl and wife to a very supportive man. I am the only 1 of 7 girls (2nd to youngest)to have breast cancer. All sisters checked yearly was my first mammo. I starting taking this farce 2 months after initial surgery (no more breast tissue). Have been active and healty all my life. I can relate to the side effects. Starting 1 month after starting to take each of the following popped in at a rate of 2 each week. Depression, Blood pressure high even w/pills to lower, outer vaginal rash/itching all over, joint pain I limp after sitting at my desk at work, or driving, isomni, Sweating during the day just going to the bathroom or moving around, tired/ lack of motivation, gained 10 pounds immediately and then kept gaining and swelling everywhere could tell if I had any salt the day before. After I quit taking last month I want to get busy in the bedroom, exercise, don't have to keep buying clothes every week, take my girls to have fun and the sweats and cramping in legs and feet have decreased to a dull roar. I felt I was pushed into taking this pill and I see no benefit to my quality of life. Am encouraged to see other woman say no........ I will not take multiple other drugs to keep this other cancer causing pill under control. I enjoy keeping my wits about me to take care of my family,make choices to improve mental and physical health. I know there are other choices but for me I am looking forward to running and getting in snuggle time with my family.",1
I Have Been on Tamoxifen now since   7/06 so far so good but i am al ways  have the fear that it might come back,5
"Diagnosed with Stage I estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in July 2006. Started Tamoxifen in Oct. '06. Only side effects I've experienced are heightened PMS symptoms, including mood swings, night sweats, and extreme irritability. Overall I feel the benefits of taking the drug outweigh the negatives at this point.",3
I've been stable for 3 years.  I've been on tamoxifen for 3 years.  I have awful sweats.  It does not matter if it's night or day.  Know I'm having really bad joint pain.  Don't sleep any more.  Sometimes breathing become difficult.  I continue because I'm afraid to stop.  The experience has been torture but it's better than cancer.,4
"""Get ready for the ride""...as a doctor described candidly what he has seen with this drug.  I will be as simplistic as possible.  Benefits seem to outweigh the negatives.  Treatment should include a slower introduction to the drug and move the dosage up to avoid the side effects.  I grind my pill up and put it in yogurt.  This lessened the side effects for me.  My breast tissue changed very quickly on this drug. They wanted me on 20 mg but the side effects were severe and I went on 10mg.  My mother survived breast cancer and was given 5 mg.  I think this is a miracle drug from what we have seen in my family.  Caution should be used  to adjust your body to this drug.  ",3
I have been taking tamoxifen for 6 months...had a lumpectomy and mammosite for stage 1 and 1 cmn......I was on 2 other drugs..I had morning sickness everyday...I have had no problem with tamoxifen until 2 weeks ago.....I have extreme vaginal dryness and yeast infection....does this go away?.. ,3
"After 6 months of chemo, and when Femara failed after two years, my oncologist prescribed Tamoxifen.  That was 3 years ago. It's so easy - like taking a vitimin everyday.  Hot flashes?  Occasionally - but definitely bearable - and they have lessened over time. ",5
"this medication cause me a lot of other problems. I was having panic attach, high blood pressure, could not sleep well and could not  concentrate. To deal with the side effect I was taking lexapro to deal with the panic attach, xanax, and a high blood pressure medication. I did stop taking tamoxifen and everything went back to normal. I am not sure if the cancer will be back, but I really needed my life back to normal. I prefer to live well that little I have left then try to stay alive and die for the side effect just to prevent recurrence of the cancer. I was diagnosed in 2006.",1
"My dr prescribed Evista rather than tamoxifen, haven't started yet.  Terrified. Breast biopsy came back neg but High risk.  Heard Evista worse side effects... but, could cut my risk in half. Very confused and scared!",1
"After 3 months of constant nauseau from this drug, I asked my Oncologist what was the percentage that it decreased my chances of a recurrence.  When he told me only 3% and yet refused to change me to another drug, I quit taking it myself.  I am now about to go back for another lump found in my breast (in the scar tissue) and will find out the results soon.  Even so, I am glad I did not continue this drug. ",3
hot flashes and being tired alot,5
"Having tried two other drugs, aromitase inhibitors, before going to this one, the biggest problem I have with this one is the leg and foot cramps.  Can't seem to do anything to get rid of them.  Other than that, I prefer it to the last two.",5
breast cancer but I developed blood clots in my lungs and have been taken off of it,1
"I am 46 and I have been taking Tamoxifen for 10 months. The ""hot flashes"" are not too terrible. They have increased over the months but not a big deal at all. I do get sad but never suicidal or deeply depressed. Giving up watching the news and crime shows daily cured my blues. Gained some weight and ran to see Jenny Craig! I have had some increased amounts of hair falling out however completely unnoticeable. And finally, I have had only one period since my double mastectomy last June which was two and a half months before I started taking Tamoxifen. What a nice bonus! I have also had three reconstructive surgeries while taking Tamoxifen with no problems. Attitude is 90% of the cure. I am happy, I am alive! Don't sweat the little side affects, things could always be worse. Good luck to you all. :)",5
"I am back again after 3 months and 1 week on T. Got my first blood work and have fibrin strands in my blood sample. Never knew that my 2 calf cramps were due to T, I thought it was from my Physical Therapy for my bad back. Need to talk to my oncologist on Monday. Eye exam in Sept and Gyno exam in October. I worry about getting a blood clot. May go off this drug if symptoms progress and go on Arimidex and a shot for my bones once a year. Don't know how my bone density is since last October. My oncaDX said I had a 15% recurrance rate and 9% with the 34 radiation treatments I had and taking T for 3 years and Arimidex for 2 years. I am kind of concerned now.",3
"I have been taking tamoxifen for 6 months now, day and night sweats get worse every day and night ",3
"After lumpectomy, radiation, chemo + herceptin,have taken Tamoxifen for 6 months with only change so far being cessation of periods-a good thing for me! ",3
"This was possibly the worst medication I ever attempted to take.  Found a list of 35 side effects and I had 32.  Couldn't sleep, weight gain, hair loss, deep depression, among other side effects.  Quit taking it and was changed to femara.  It was even worse in it's side effects.  Depression  Was so bad that I was threatened with termination from work. Was told ""Having cancer was not as bad as getting a divorce"".  A lot they would know.  These 2 ladies who told me that should walk a mile in my shoes.  Finally,  I sought a 2nd opinion from another oncolgist.  He reviewed my history and since I had less than 1 cm lump that had not spread, he decided that I could go off both of the medicines I had tried at one time or another.  My depression was so bad that I am now on Cymbalta, thank goodness it has helped.  I am still having side effects after almost a year but they are slowly disappearing. ",1
" shortness of breath,leg pain",1
"DCIS, stage 0, intermediate grade, lumpectomy, 6 wks radiation. Started on tam Nov '05. Constant hot flashes, b6 helps a little, efexxor made me feel weird. Hard time sleeping, sleep aids make me feel groggy. Weight gain, was always thin before, now it's hard to lose. Leg cramps, magnesium helps greatly. Vaginal dryness for the last year, ouch! I feel like I've aged a lot physically. I do like that I stopped having periods after 6 mos, hope they stay away after I'm done. I'm happy to be alive and plan to keep taking it for the full 5 years even though it's been rough, the Dr said it means it's working, which also helps me to keep on going. I will be having a huge celebration in Nov '10! Good luck to all of you, keep on keepin' on! ",5
"I have chosen NOT to take Tamoxifen. Too many side effects for me. I was diagnosed with DCIS Breast Cancer. Found during routine mammogram. Had lumpectomy and am starting radiation next week. My doctor explained to me that Tamoxifen is separate from radiation, it does not go hand in hand. Radiation will decrease the chance of the cancer from coming back in the one breast. Tamoxifen decreases the chance 50% from cancer appearing any where. so the way i look at it is it is a 50/50 chance either way. Not enough for me to take Tamoxifen. This to me is a very scary drug. Everyone of course needs to make their own decisions. But before taking it i would research and not take it unless you feel comfortable with your decision. I hope this helps people trying to make this decision. talk to your doctor, surgeon, oncologist, and radiation doctor before making your decision. ",1
"I am frustrated that I have not been able to find statistics that would help me make an educated decision on whether or not to continue the tamoxifen as I am very concerned about all the possible side effects.  Almost all info states that the risks are worth the benefits.  I am not convinced.  If my risk before the chemo and radiation was 10% of recurring, how much does taking this drug decrease my risk of getting breast cancer again.  I had a lumpectomy for stage 1, 1 cm ER positive tumor which had not spread to the lymph nodes, with good boundaries. What is the chance that I will develop another cancer due to taking the tamoxifen which is a known carcinogen.  How wise it to give women who have had breast cancer a drug that is a carcinogen?  My fear is that if I stop taking it, my luck it would return & then I would kick myself for not staying on it. IF I continue to take it, any one of many possible horrible side effects could occur. I wish I could have some peace of mind!  I am also concerned about what the lack of estrogen is doing to my aging process.  I feel that I have aged considerably since taking this medication.  Not to mention that if I have a stroke at my age, or vision problems, I may have 30 years to live with those side effects.  What are the odds of getting these side effects?  I haven't been able to find this information. If anyone can help answer these questions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.",3
It has been recommended to me to take this drug because my mother is a breast cancer survivor and I am at high risk of development.Trying to weigh the benefits against the risks here. Has a hysterectomy 10 years ago but no breast cancer or lumps to date.  Don't like the sounds of the horrible side effects of Tamoxifin. Just have gotten the hot flashes/night sweats somewhat under control after the hysterectomy.  Any suggestions/recommendations from anyone else in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.,1
I'VE BEEN TAKING THIS MEDICINE FOR TWO MONTHS AND SO FAR I GUESS I'TS ALRIGHT.THE WHOLE OVER ALL EXPERIENCE FOR ME IS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMING BUT I'M ADJUSTING,4
Have not started the pill yet. Trying to get reviews from others.,1
I had stage 2 breast cancer in Aug. 2006-had mastectomy-started tamox. Jan 07-had hot flashes and night sweats for at least 1 year-no other side effects other than fatigue,4
"this medication has been very effective for me. It's use is very easy to take, and it's satisfaction of my experience was no side effects for the years taken.",5
"So far so good. Learned after my second upset stomach to take with food. People , please look up the interactions and anything else on T. Be sure to tell your doctor all meds,  herbs and vitamins you are taking. They have now found out that depression meds can make T not work. Black Co hash is estrogen. Do NOT take Omega-3 Fatty Acids or any antioxidants. They interact with T. Now I am going to be tested for the CDY4D6 genotype. 7-10% of women will not benefit from T with this out of whack. Also, if have a variant of e-cadhern protein, T will cause a different kind of aggressive cancer. I have been on T for about a month and no side effects except my nails have become brittle even though I take gelatin caps. Small price to pay. I am Stage 1, oncaDX 15, had a lumpectomy and second surgery for clear margin. I have 12 more radiation treatments and have some redness since didn't really spread the aloe gel around. No chemo thank God!",5
"Lumpectomy no nodes involved  Started on tamoxifen after having lumpectomy, chemo(5 treatments of 8) and radiation.Stopped chemo due to allergic reaction to taxol. radiation was a breeze(33 treatments). After 1 week of tamoxifen i got horrible hand pain. Drs said it was carpel tunnel and arthritis. to young and it came on suddenly so i didn't beleive this.Couple weeks later and no releif from tylenol, ibuprofen and tramadol. I realized that the pain started after taking tomoxifen and i stopped taking it. Contacted Dr.and he put me on gabapentin and to hold tamoxifen for a week. Hand pain is slowly getting better but i really know it if i am late at taking the gabapentin.Hoping to quit tamoxifen all together.",1
"I had stage 4 BC w/16 of 19 pos nodes in 1984. Had mast, 13 mo extensive chemo, 6 wk rad & cobalt. In 2/08 BC on other side. Had mast, now on Tam and I feel great! No weight gain (I walk a lot) and only have flashes very seldom and still have great sex drive, no dryness like others have and no joint pain except my lower back has bothered off and on for several yrs) I just don't have any complaints and so Blessed to be alive. After my 1st go around/ this one was a snap!! Praise God!!",5
"DCIS stage 0 grade 3, no metasteses, e+. Started T. on 1/2/09.  Lumpectomy no clear margin then unilateral mastectomy 12/8/08.  Being perimenopausal and on Effexor XR anyway, can't attribute any side effects to meds. Lost a lot of weight, but started exercising with a personal trainer.  1 period since starting, I think it was my last. Doctor said my system cleaning itself out.  Grateful for a preventive measure for my other breast.",5
This medication has caused indigestion and stomach ulcer symptoms as well as weight gain. Weight gain is another risk factor!,3
"I personally have found Tamoxifen to affect my life in two ways - tiredness and my eyesight has been affected tremendously.  I never used to wear glasses, now I have to have glasses w/bi-focals and cannot read a book or magazine without my glasses.  I am researching further in hopes to find some answers.",5
iam having alot of pain all over my body especially my legs.,2

thank all who reviewed it really helped me to see how blessed I am. Started T 3 months ago and so  far so good not one side effect. dx dics stage l w/lumpteccmy and 32 radiation treatments. I was worried because of the possibility of side effects,5
"Age 49 premenopausal on T 3 mos. Brain fog and couldn't sleep at first, caused hyper anxious feelings. Slight weight loss and diarreah. Oddly, breast resumed skin color and texture issues from radiation that previously healed and now broke out in seriously itchy allergic rash over body. Wonder if it is T? No other meds. Dr. said stop 2 weeks to see. Other than this issue, the side effects were lessening but some malaise persists. ",2
"out of 20 side effects, i had 18 of them",1
This was my third day. Slight upset stomach after just lining stomach with a banana first. Took toast and queasiness went away. Lots of of bottled water. I am 61 years old with Stage 1 breast cancer. Two surgeries since didn't get clear margin in the past 2 months . So far I am very happy since I haven't had any side effects. I start radiation in 3 days so I will let you all know. ,3
"I have been on tamoxifen for 4 1/2 years.although I have very thin hair,some vaginal dryness, and have trouble staying asleep at night, I am grateful to have come this far. I was DX with stage 3 Adenocarcinoma in July 2004, ""my hubby did a little squeeze"". He found my lump. it turned out to be not one, but five lumps in three diferrent positions on my right breast.  Thankfully they all grew independently,  and it was determind to not have been metastasized. I had a double mastectomy and hysterectomy beacuse I was estrogen receptor positive. thank god for the ""BUDDY CHECK""!!I am looking forward to the rest of my life .....",5
"I've been on T for one year. Side effects include weight gain,hair became dry & brittle, yeast infections, leg cramps, urine odor, and night sweats/hot flashes. Changing to KY gel for sex helped alot with the yeast infections and irritation. I will stay on it to keep the cancer away.",5
When I first started this I was very depressed my dr. put me on antideppresent and I feel great now.I have a few hot flashes but have been told would be worse as I also had ovarian tumors and had a htysterectomy,5

I've been taking tamoxifen for 3 months now.  I had regular periods for the first two months, no period this month.  Night sweats (bearable), some fuzzy-headedness, dry mouth (especially during winter).  Minute weight gain, but my side hurts where the lump was removed.  I read another lady had the same problem.  I find that when I use that side (stretching, lifting, sometimes even holding the leash in that hand when I walk the dogs) causes that side to hurt.  I try to favor the left and use heat when the right bothers me.   Not having a period is weird, don't know yet whether I like it or not.  Sex life is fine.  All in all I've had a pretty positive experience thus far.",4
"caused some forgetfulness, feeling hot inside my body, sleep irregularity, change in mensrual cycle",3

"I started Tamoxifen in August 2008 after lumpectomy and mammosite radiation.  No chemo required due to excellent results from OncoDX testing.  I have experienced occasional night sweats and weight gain.  However, I am also experiencing a lot of pain in both armpits.  I have swelling at times.  Body is achy (flu-like symptoms).  Oncologist and internist not very concerned.  They both feel these are side effects of tamoxifen.  Is anyone else experiencing pain and swelling in the armpits?",4

I know I should be grateful that my cancer has not returned, but the weight gain really has gotten me down.",5
"I did have difficulty with mood swings and a general depressive feeling for much of the 5 years I took daily doses of tamoxifen.  My weight steadily increased and after 5 years on the drug, losing even a portion of that weight is difficult.

I have had some kind of infection in the outer vagina since the beginning and none of my doctors can figure out what it is - anyone else with this proble? Also a constant yeast infection. Also a very dry vagina making sex impossible due to pain. I have told my doctor that after 1 year we will look at alternatives. He will test my hormones to see if I am post menopausal yet, is so, we will switch to an AI. If not, he tells me my only other alternative is steroids. I WILL NOT take them. If necessary I will simply stop taking! The side effects are killing my sex life and my marriage. I have zero sex drive.",2
"Just started in Aug. After mastectomy I am Post menopausal, started having horrible hotflashes very emotional, can't sleep. I am very thankful for no other treatment.

"I initially posted in March 2008 when I first started Tamoxifen. Now, six months later, I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced chronic diarrhea? I've been having issues with it, and can almost pinpoint the onset to about a month after I started taking this drug. None of the posts have made mention of it. Anyone?",4
I've been taking this tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years.  I'm 39 years old and have had heavy or irregular bleeding with discharge every month.  Been checked out and not Uterus cancer or vaginal.    Will stick out for the 5 year mark. ,4

No weight gain but, I've cut back on the sugars and grains. I take Vitamin E, D3, Multivitamin, Calcium with D, Glucosamine, Magnesium to give back what the Tamoxifen and my high blood pressure pill take away and Lots of water daily.    Joined a Yoga class and walk and try to do something each day to keep the weight off.  I was told to watch my intake of Soy as that can act as an estrogen when taking Tamoxifen. I get headaches...low back pain, and now have a bacterial infection and discharge.  Have an inflamed ovary now also...ultrasound next week...no periods since Jan. 08 when I started chemo..simple/radical mastectomy ...17 nodes taken all clear...invasive ductal carcinoma.

"Other than hot flashes, it has worked for me",5
"I took this drug for five years in 1989,I am here today because of it.If you want to complain about the side-effects of this drug,you just do not understand the importance for life.",5
Started on Tamoxifen on August 1 after lumpectomy and mammosite radiation.  OncoDX test resulted in low recurrance level. Oncologist recommended tamoxifen instead of chemo.  I have experienced weight gain and made an appt. with a weight mgmt/nutrionist doctor to address this issue.  Hopefully she can put me on a helathy diet that will result in weight loss.  ,4
"I have been on tamoxifen for about 10 months.  I have had slight weight gain and experienced hot flashes - some minor, some more intense.  Nothing I can't deal with.  My dr was going to put me on Efexor for the hot flashes, but after looking on WebMD and reading reviews of others on this drug, I decided it wasn't worth it.  99% of the reviews for Efexor were frightening.  I am so glad I checked it out on here before going on that drug.  As for the tamoxifen, so far so good.  I guess we won't know until later in life if it was successful, but I'm sticking with it.",4
"I wrote the post on August 6th stating that I was discontinuing the drug.  It's been 13 days and while I don't see immediate results, I'm staying off of it.  I gained 16 pounds since January and now find it really hard to lose.  The hot flashes seemed to have subsided, now let's see about the sex drive. The vaginal discharge was horrible for about 3 months but seemed to have gotten better.  If I hadn't read the comments on this site, I never would have stopped taking it.  I think while it may be great for some, it was horrible for me.  Thanks again everyone.",1
"I began Tamoxifen on 7/1/08.  I have gained 7 pounds (all in my belly) and have had tons of hot flashes.  I also have crampiness in my belly and have to use the bathroom frequently.  I discontinued use because I felt it was interfering with my quality of life.  The more I exercised, the more weight I gained.  I'm disappointed.  Did anyone else experience this?",3
"I, like many women on this site, was diagnosed with early breast cancer a year ago.  I had the Mammosite Radiation procedure and a lumpectomy.   The Oncologist put me on Tamoxofen for 5 years.  In the 9 months that I have been taking this horrible drug, I have had the following side effects:  Loss of sexual desire, vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge, hot flashes, weight gain, fatigue (no matter how much I sleep), and a feeling of being mentally foggy. As of today, I am going to stop taking it.  After reading everyone's comments, I feel I would be better off seeing if I get my energy back, lose the weight I put on and regain my sex drive. The negatives far outweigh the positives for me. Thanks to everyone who took the time to input their comments.",3
Just started tamox July 1. First week had the fog over my brain.. slight nausea. not too bad. night sweats came instantly. I take it at night. I haven't been taking with a lot of water like it says and i feel real nausea the pass few days. I will take it and put up with it. I like life!!,3
"I have been on Tamoxifen for 6 months now. I am 47 yrs.old. I was Stage 1. I had a Lumpectomy and Radiation. From the start of taking the med. I have been having Hot Flashes/Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Hair Loss, Irregular or Heavy Bleeding,Constant Thirst,Mood Swings/Depression,Trouble Sleeping,Yeast Infections.{ WOW! } Way too many side effects for me to continue using the Tamoxifen.And I worry about long term side effects. I think exercising, eating a good diet, and( praying) is better than taking a pill that could cause other problems.",3
pain at the top and bottom of long bones in the legsand arms and also the feet I feel it relates to possible dietary interaction.  once the pain starts it takes several weeks to go away,3
"I refuse to take this drug.  i have done extensive research and for me, I do not beleive this will help my 'Quality "" of life.  Way tooo mnay side effects.  i have had a double mastectomy due to satge 2 invasive lobular carcinoma. No radiation was required. My oncologist wants me to take this in case the cancer has spread. They have no way of knowing if it has spread due to the fact that i had a rare undetectable cancer. never showed on the two mamo's i had or the ultrasound. Only a soft tissue MRI showed any growth. I did have chemo and that wiped me out.  The pathology report showed all cancer gone.  I do not want to spend the rest of my life taking drugs to ward off any 'chance' of a reoccurrance elsewhere in the body. Especially, when the drug can give one cancer, and many other health risks.   I would rather live healthy in mind about my decision than second guess a maybe.  Hope this helps some of you.",1
"I just finished taking tamoxifen after 5 years!!Its been 2 months and my period still hasn't returned. I had stage one breast cancer @ the age of 30. I just had radiation not chemo. I haven't had a period in 3 years, low sex drive & mood swings. The mood swings were the worst side effect for me.",4
I have been on tamixfen for six months for breast cancer prevention due to abnormal biopsy. I am forty five and have only had two periods in six months which is nice. I do however have horrible hot flashes and night sweats . I am not sleeping well. My doctor suggested effexor to help wwith these seffects. Iplan to start this Anyone else taking this?,5
"i'm 47 and have been diagnosed with breast cancer in '99, '06, & '07.  I had 2 lumpectomies, radiation, and bilateral mastectomies.  i've been taking tamoxifen for about a year and a half i think.  i had no peri-menopausal symptoms prior to taking it.  i still don't have hot flashes, night sweats, or anything like that, but my period trickled off and now i've only had 1 period in the past year.  my gynocologist said i have plenty of hormones and am not peri or menopausal.  i never thought i'd miss my period ... i think i've been somewhat depressed since i started taking it.  i've had some very squishy weight gain.  i've had all kinds of gynecological issues that i never use to have.  i've been diagnosed with lichen sclerosis.  i have an ongoing yeast infection and i don't have a history of them.  at least i had a good sex life til i was diagnosed with those, now it hurts to have sex.  i wish i knew more pre-menopausal women on tamoxifen to talk to.  i hate this med but my oncologist doesn't seem to want to talk about anything else.   i don't know if the medicine is ""effective"" for me until i live the rest of my life without getting breast cancer again so i rated that a ""1"".  sure, the medication is ""easy"" to use, i swallow a pill every day.  i'm not sure if tamoxifen is causing my gynecological problems, depression, weight gain, and tiredness, but in case it is, i'll rate ""ease of use"" a ""1"", too.  damn.  i didn't realize how much i sounded like eeyore.  ",1
"While treating for early stage breast cancer after lumpectomy and radiation, had to take this drug. Worst side effects ever. Uncontrollable hot flashes, horrible weight gain, pains and aches. Hot flashes were not controllable even after effexor. Doctor switched me to Evista and although the weight gain is bad, the effects of evista are hardly anything. Am happy i am off the tamoxifen.  Evista has been approved for early stage breast cancer and i am feeling MUCH better, heavier, but better!!",1
I use Tamoxifen 10Mg every12 hours with  Prednisone 30Mg a day for the condition of Sclerosing Mesenteritis for three months or to reduce the chronic fibrosing inflammation,3
"I am now 48. Five years ago I started taking Tamoxifen. 3 days ago I got done with my 5 years. During the 5 years I have had joint pain I have not felt like I had energy to do much, I had really bad hot flashes. Would I take it again and go though 5 years of this.... YES!!! 3 days ago I stopped taking Tamoxifen and I am already starting to feel better. I was told that I should feel like a new woman within 2 weeks. I am counting down the days. Right now I do fine for a while and then all of a sudden I can't keep my eyes open. My doctor said that I will be that way for a little while and then one day I will wake up and be totaly awake and have my energy back. I am just so glad they now have RX like Tamoxifen to give us a fighting chance.",5
I am 51 and had lumpectomy in June 07 and had 7 weeks of radiation.  Have been on Tamoxifen for 7 months.  Had slight hot flashes for a few months but have since subsided.  No other symptoms at the moment.,4
I had a mastectomy and tram flap reconstruction as a result of infiltrating lobular cancer July2007. Began tamoxifen 9 months ago To date have experienced minor foot cramps and mild flushes. I was however waking every 2 hoursthoughout the night as the diuretic effects of the drug took effect. I changed from night time medicating to morning and have since experienced much better sleeping patterns.,3
Diagnosed 2/07 with DCIS stg 1.  Her2/neu positive receptor posit. Recurrance test 70% it would return. Lump/chemo/Radiation.  Been on Tamox 6 months. Pins/needles type hot flashes went away after 90 days what a relief. Feet/Leg cramps severe.  Started exercising 4weeks into radiation.  Now training for a marathon but have noticed belly weight gain the more I exercise. Will talk with Dr at next visit about this.  Anyone have the same?  ,3
"I was diagnosed at age 44 with early stage breast cancer..had lumpectomy and radiation..I was on Tamoxifen for 5 years 2003-2008 and went through hot flashes and some vagingal discharge, but the worst side effect for me was joint pain...mostly in my hands, but sometimes wrists, elbows and shoulders...since my last pill, I have had no significant joint pain. I am pre-menupausal (sp?) whether that is significant or not..what bothered most was that no doctors admit that joint pain is a side effect of the drug...I suppose if the cancer does not come back, it was worth the agony for the five years. Thank the Lord, I am cancer free at this time!",5
"I have been using 20mg of Tamoxifen 1x per day for the past 9 months for stage 1 IDC.  I haven't noticed any side-effects at all.  I might as well be taking a sugar pill.  I started on Tamoxifen after lumpectomy, abdominal exploratory surgery and 34 rounds of radiation and feel fine.  I'm 42 yrs. old",5
Tamoxifen side effects were worse than the chemotherapy and radiation treatments. I was not able to sleep. I was extremely depressed. The hot flashes were uncontrollable.,1
"I had been taking estrogen injections for 24 years until my breast cancer diagnosis. Off the HRT, I began having severe, frequent hot flashes. After mastectomy and 2 doses of chemo(I felt like more would kill me it was so horrible), I've been on Tam for a month. The hot flashes are even worse despite using  Vit E, Black Cohash, & now trying Clonidine and Gabapentin: mood swings and depression plus worsened (long term) insomnia.  I must decide if living this way is worthwhile. I may opt to go off Tam and back on estrogen.",4
"I have been on this drug for approximately 6 weeks after initially trying Arimidex and not being able to tolerate it. I am post-menopausal so am not experiencing many of the harsher side effects as many of you, though that's not to say they won't pop up in the future. After my negative experience with Arimidex, this drug has been been relatively easy for me to tolerate. Main ""symptoms"" have been: sluggish, little energy and mentally fuzzy at times, difficulty sleeping some nights, mini hot flashes that come on about an hour after taking the drug then subside after a short time, and occasional charley horse cramps in my feet. If this is the extent of the side effects, I'll be delighted. After my Arimidex experience, I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to tolerate any of the follow-up hormone treatments, but so far so good. ",4
"When I get hot I feel like a hundred bees are sting me.  Had hot flashes and up the effexor xr to 75mg and much better.  I have stop taking it for the last three weeks and I feel alot better, mind has cleared up but i still have the stinging.  Doctor doesn't know what is causing this think maybe reaction to one of the drugs that I take (herceptin, tamoxifen and effexor xr75mg.  Any suggestions? ",3
"Diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in November 2007, my doctors are amazed at the miraculous recovery they have seen and the way my body has responded to tamoxifen.  Tamoxifen not only treats the cancer of the breasts and the metastasis to my liver as well but in three months od taking the drug it has continued to control the cancer in my bone and since sarting the treatment in Feb 07, my liver enzymes have gone down from over 800 to 267 and the high normal is 111.  The doctors no longer consider my condition terminal and the best part of the whole thing is that I have the confidence o knowing I get to be a mother to my five month old daughter.  I was diagnosed in my seventh month of pregnancy and I was 32 years old at the time of my diagnosis.",5
"Most of the complaints that are listed here I already have as a part of perimenopause - hot flashes, brian fog, leg crampss, irregular or heavy bleeding.  So I guess I won't be able to tell the difference when I go on Tam.  My Doc recommended Remefemin,  Black Cohosh, Soy, Vitamin E, Multi + B Complex vitamins and if needed my Effexor increased, since I am already on it.",1
"sWITCHEWD BACK TO TAMOXIFEN after gtrying Arimidex, to counter the aching muscles.  Now concerned about constant thirst. Anyone esle have that side effect?  ",4
i have two more years to take tomoxifin.so far so good.i hope afterwards it continues to work.i have not had any complications with it so far.,3
"I was diagnosed with Stage 2 Grade 3 Ductal Carcinoma at age 39. Had chemotherapy first, then lumpectomy, then radiation, then tamoxifen. Been on and off Tamoxifen since July 2007. Finally reached the point where I can't take it anymore. I have foot cramps and sometimes leg cramps. My menstrual flows are inconsistent with heavy bleeding. I have experienced terrible hot flashes and nausea. I was given effexor which adds to my fatigue and too much increases nausea. The worse symptom is the extreme fatigue. It makes me feel like I am becoming ill, and it happens at various times of the day, sometimes only one time per week, sometimes multiple times. The doctor has tested my thyroid and blood sugar, but can't help me. I want to give up even though the doctor tells me it is dangerous for me not to take the pill.",1
Almost 3 years after treating stage 2 cx with chemo and radiation and then Tam. I have been told of yet another side effect. I now have a heart condition called cardiomyopathy. I am only 41 and too young to feel this old! I am grateful that I will soon be off Tam (by the way also probably was a major contributor to extreme heavy bleeding which lead to a partial hyst.) and on to an AI. All you who are younger watch your heart! Get a baseline EKG ASAP.,3
"I had stage 2 breast cancer, had bi-lateral mastectomy, chemo.  Started taking Tamoxifen 3 months ago.  Hot flashes for first month then no side effects at all.  My periods stopped during my chemo and came back this past week.  I'm am concerned why they have come back and now considering hystorectomy.  Going to the doctor soon to have questions answered.  ",4
"I am taking this drug after 5 of my doctors said I should take this drug for prevention of Breast Cancer. I am a 14 yr survior of Hodgkins. I am taking this drug because of all the radiation I received in my treatment. I have pretty much taken all the radiation I can receive to my upper chest area. At the time I also took 4 chemo drugs for 6 months. I am now 41 yrs old. I am having tons of side effects. Hot Flashes   ( worst then the ones from chemo) and many sleepless nights. I have also had some emotional days( which are not pleasant because I work with young children). Leg cramps and severe foot craps. I am trying to combat sleepless nights by exercising. Have not had any weight gain. But I have added miles to my runs and even added an extra ""run"" day. On days when I run I can get several hours of sleep. Wish I didn't have to take the tamoxifen. But when 5 out of 5 doctors encourage you to take something then you take it. Got to go having a flash now! Stay well everyone!",3
"I've been on Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years for Stage 3 Breast Cancer following bi-lateral mastectomy, chemo and radiation. The hot flashes are tough and I've gained about 10 pounds but that is probably due to lack of exercise and poor eating habits. I have terrible back pain and nerve pain (not sure if it is attributable to Tamoxifen). Some vaginal discharge but most of my symptoms of leg cramps and muscle pain have subsided with time. I have had emotional issues but those too seem to have gotten better with time. My Dr. told me hot flashes are a good thing because they mean the Tamoxifen is working - that makes them bearable. I'll take the side effects if it means I get to see my kids grow up!",4
"Dxd with IDCIS Stage I RT. Treated with lumpectomy. Lymph nodes negative. Margins not clear. Needed mastectomy.  Four weeks later did bilateral mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction. When I started Tamoxifen I had terrible headaches which went away after 1 month then the bone/joint pain started.  It was terribly severe. Because of postoperative anemia I could not take NSAIDs.  My period stopped after 2 months on tamoxifen.  On month 3 I began heavy menstrual bleeding which lasted 4 months and was stopped after a hysterectomy.  The pathology report from the hysterectomy was negative and it is likely that Tamoxifen caused the adenomyosis symptoms and the bleeding.  I am happy to get ""anything that could get cancerous"" out of my body and do not regret the total hysterectomy.  Upon resuming Tamoxifen again the headaches are not as bad but the joint pain makes it impossible for me to do my job (clerical) I'm going to try physical therapy and possibly a TENS unit but if it does not work I am not sure I will continue the Tamoxifen.  I cannot afford to be unemployed.  I am doing healthy dieting-limiting sugars (cancer's favorite food) and will start exercise program after physical therapy to educate me on new movements because of my abdominal (TRAM flap) reconstruction.",3
"I've been on the tamoxifen for almost 2yrs. The hot flashes/night sweats are unbearable.  I can't sleep sweating all night.  I actually sleep with Ice packs, fans, etc.  I have put on so much weight and I don't eat more than I used too.  I am so miserable.  I don't have the major mood swings of menopause because I take effexor, which helps.  I can't believe they can't find a ""cure"" for the hot flashes/night sweats.  The doctors just shrug, ""Oh, well""...  This is no life, I spend the summer inside and very rarely leave the house and I'm only 43...  It's so embarrassing having a hot flash at the grocery store, they look at me like I'm nuts...  I'd rather go through Chemo again than live like this...",3
Three years since my lumpectomy and radiation. Was supposed to take Tamox. I am not trusting of pharm. companies and feel I am not going to harm my body with more chemicals. I am still having clear mammograms and feel great. Eating whole foods and exercise are a much better alternative than a pill.,1
My biggest side effect is vaginal discharge/yeast type issues.  Has anyone else had this problem?,5
"my life has been miserable since I started taking this drug in august.  I am trying to get through this but I am at my wits end.  Started walking and dieting and still weight gain. I can live with that but the hot flashes are unbearable.  I can put up with most side effects from my medications, this is the first to throw me a loop. Havent had a good sleep since starting tamoxifen{two fans in bedroom, window open in winter  zero temperatures] wearing shorts and halters in daytime.  I just want to cry.I was always an easy going,happy  person, now I am tired ,hot and cranky. seeing doctor next week to see if some medication help or change will work. considering going off the drug as I cant live like this.",1
Having hot flashes and leg cramps. Have developed rosacia. Wonder if caused by med. Better than getting cancer. Time will tell if effective.,3
"Been on Tamoxifen since September 07. So far I have had weight gain/Loss, very mild hot flashes,cramping(as if getting my period) and just today for the first time light bleeding, its freaking me out, but have checkup next week, hoping it's  nothing serious.Will get estrogen levels checked next month, so we'll see.",3
Have been on tamoxifen for 3wks and am premenopausual.Severe mood swings and teariness were my only obstacles so far...,3
The first 60 days I experienced severe joint pain and heavy feeling in muscles-aching and mental foggines. I thought you gotta be kidding me.  All those symptoms disappeared after 60 days. I hung in there to give it enough time for my body to synthesize to the medication. The only remarkable issue I am having is a burning sensation around the vulva which I have never experienced prior to using this drug.  Can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone if it is related to the drug.  I will say this-I quit smoking recently using Chantix and I do think it has had a positive effect on mood enhancement due to the way it works with the dopamine receptors in the brain.  The mental fog has cleared that I was experiencing after treatment and early use of tamoxifen and I feel much more like I use to before cancer! ,5
"Has anyone else experienced stomach cramps as a side effect? I've taken tamoxifen for almost 5 years and have experienced some minor hot flashes and leg cramps, and just recently have been having stomach cramps regularly after taking the med.  All mammograms are clear so guess it must have done it's job.",4
"I have taken tamoxifen for little over a year,but there are changes in the lining of my uterus,also my firoids are geting bigger and moe bothersome.Usually duing menopause the fibroids will shrink.So the reason for the changes are being investigated.And i take zoloft for the hot flashes but i worry about the long term affect with my female organs.",4
"I have been on this med for 4 plus years and will soon be changing to Femara....I have lost 30 pounds by changing my eating habits and reducing stress in my life...Minor hot flashes on occasion, with no prob because I already handled that when I went thru menopause. As I change meds and check this site, I find NEGATIVE remarks prevail and I wanted to assure someone to trust the med and stay positive..it could save your life.",5
"Taking for 5 months, unable to lose weight I gained despite strict diet and 5-6 days/wk of exercise.  Have not slept since I've been on it, sleep 20 mins up 45.  Leg cramps, night sweats and hot flashes keep me company while I'm not sleeping.  My cancer was caught early, slow growing and non-invasive.  I'm going to take my chances without tamoxifen - the quality of my life means more to me than the fear of a reoccurrence.  If my cancer had been more aggressive, or if my treatment had been more intense, I might reconsider.",3
In the past 7 months I have taken oral Tamoxifen my feet have developed both plantar facsitus and extreme nerve sensitivity.  Could the med be causing this discomfort?,2
"I have been on the Tamoxifen since April 2007. I am having stiffness in my joints, very mild hot flashes and trouble sleeping. Not an issue if this prevents the cancer from returning",3
"I took the drug for 2 years.I started bleeding very bad(thank God my uterus was not cancerous)I had hot flashes so bad to where they kept me from a restful sleep,charley horses were painful and I felt I was depressed.Been off the med for a year now,few mild hot flashes,no charley horses,not depressed,no bleeding ,feel better.",1
Terrible night sweats and hot flashes but worth it if it does the job.  You learn to deal with it.,3
"Hate Tamoxifen with a passion - severe side effects - hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, cramps, memory loss, forgetfulness, loss of motivation.  How come it prevents breast cancer when it is possible to cause three other types of cancer???? Shouldn't it prevent ALL cancers???? If I am on it to stop estrogen dominance, why can't I use natural progesterone cream instead which would do the same job WITHOUT the side effects.????? Am seeing Specialist tomorrow and WILL NOT USE IT ANY MORE.",1
"I have been taking Tamoxofin for 2 months.  I have not experienced hot flashes, but have experienced stiffness in my joints and just recently leg cramps.  The nausea I felt at the beginning when taking the drug has subsided. ",3

MY LEGs and veins have  gotten swallen and  i am having trouble walking.is this one of the effects of the tomoxifin.the arimedix made me very sick.,1
"I have been taking Tamoxifen for 6 months following lumpectomy, chemo and radiation for Grade 1 Stage 2 Lobular Carcinoma. Have hot flashes day and night (reduced by using Black Cohosh). Weight gain as well, but dealing with that. Otherwise, no significant negative side effects. Positive - no more menstrual cycles.",4
Experienced all the symptoms of meno-pause plus severe headaches. Never had headaches prior to taking the RX. They are so severe at times  that I have decided to stop treatment.( for the second time) ,1
"I am very happy that I was able to take it for five years,really no side effects,the pros outweigh the cons.",5
"I have taken this drug for 2 wks and seem to have every horrible side effect.  vision problems, nausea, vomiting, bone pain, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, clumsy, etc.  I can only stand to take it every other day.  I have an appt with my doctor tomorrow and hope to get some help.  This is much worse than the blistering and burning from radiation, which was pretty bad due to having very fair skin.",1
i have been on this med since august and have had no side effects,5
"Been on Tamox. 3 years. I have had very few unbearable symptoms.  Hot flashes (but nothing like the chemo flashes), weight gain, vaginal dryness and odor.  I have the foot and leg cramps occasionally and have just started having some joint pain.  Reading the other reviews helped me realize that it was probably the Tamoxifen causing this.  ",4
"Used for 11 months. Fatigue, foot cramps, weight gain, malaise, depression, hot flashes...chose quality of life over quantity. been off the meds for 5 months, feel much better. Praying for no recurrence.",1
"Have used for 3+1/2 years. Hot flashes, joint aches and fatigue from beginning. Dry skin, vaginal discharge and horrible ankle and foot cramps later. Interfered with sexual function (helped by Estring). Overall, well worth it,--no recurrence of stage 2 cancer.",5
"Seven months into taking this, all of my joints started aching unbearably.  Symptoms disappeared when I stopped.  Symptoms reappear after just a few doses.",1
"I was diagnosed with early ductal cancer and had no chemo or radiation . . . only a lumpectomy and tamoxiphen.  Now after 4 years and 60 pounds of weight gain, my doctor isn't sure the medicine is working.  I had to have a special blood test and now he may change me to something else.  ",4
this is my 4th years on the drug but i did not know leg cramps were a side effect and i now am having break thru bleeding in the vagina,4

"Have taken this drug for 3 and 1/2 years. Hot flashes are horrible. Sometimes they seem constant. Weight gain initially, but am now losing slowly. Also had headaches at begining, daily. Now about a few times a month.",4
I had an allergic reaction tamoxifen which sent my body into thinking I was in the middle of radation again. It's been 3 weeks since I've been off tamoxifen and breast still isn't back to were it was before I started the tamoxifen. The doctors said they have never encountered anything like this during their time in practice.,1
"I have been taking this for the past 2 years and have done well on it. I have hot flashes sporatically, but that's all. I have also gained 15-20 lbs but don't think it's due to the drug.",5
" I wish I never took this drug. I took it for 3 years, and was one of the causes of my stoke.",1
"i have been taking tamoxifen for 12 weeks, i do get hot flushes now but everything else is ok and am hoping long term effects are good.",5
"I have just started to take this drug, tamoxifen, after having a mastectomy on August 10th.  So far, I haven't had any side effects.",4
"Tamoxifen has been so easy to take. Every six months I have my blood work done and a few times my blood calcium level was a tad high. I have always wondered if I have that infrequent side effect from Tamoxifen. Luckily, the elevated level has not shown up every time and my thyroid and parathyroid check out fine.",5
i have been very lucky with tamoxifen a few  leg cramps and thats it.,5
Saved my life.,5

Problems with dierria ,2
"I was diagnosed with NSCLC in 11/13.  Lobectomy 12/13 followed by 16-weeks of chemo (Cisplatin/Navelbine). Recurrence discovered 12/16 (2 lymph nodes in chest, 2 lesions in brain and ground glass in upper left lung). Started Tarceva 1/17 along with Doxycycline to help with skin problems, but got serious rash anyway.  Dermatologist prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1% which started helping within 24-hours. In 4/17 CT/MRI showed significant shrinkage of all four tumors and ground glass followed for CT/MRI 6/17 showing even more shrinkage. Late July started Proton Radiation Therapy on chest at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Gamma Knife on brain to follow.  Not using Tarceva during radiation treatment. Will start again after completed. It is hoped the Tarceva will keep the ground glass from growing which is fine with me. I can live with fatigue (naps!), avoiding the sun or slathering on sun screen and the rash BUT it appears that I cannot live without the Tarceva. I do understand that eventually the Tarceva may cease being effective and I’ll deal with it (as guided by my oncologist) at that time. A non-smoker, I jogged for 35-years, have lifted weights for nearly 25-years, continue to do cardio and have a strong determination to do whatever it takes to live.

reduction in the tumors and size of tumors.,5
"My husband had been on it for 2 months and he has had the rash pretty bad, no pain very itchy. He has stage 4 lung cancer with bone mets. His breathing has improved he has no pain anywhere, even thoguh the cancer is in several areas. He has lost weight about 30 lbs since his diagnosis, loss of appetite is one of the sigsn of the cancer I don't blame it on the Tarceva. I think over all he is doing better, he has had chemotherapy and radiation, so right now this Tarceva is I consdier a maintence drug, there is no other drug that can be used at this stage. There has been no scans done as yet we are having that done next month which will be 1 year on 11/11/15 that he has been diagnosed. So we will see if this drug did its job or not. I can say it has improved his over all condition. He sometimes gets the diahrrea and that is not often, over all the side effects can be handled if you work at it and find the creams that work to help the itchinee, I have tried over 12 different types, creams, sprays and ointiments, so far Radioplex jel, Binefine creame and silverdene cream are what we are using and seem to help. But don't give up because of the side effects keep using the medication and wait and see your results that is what we are doing, if for some reason it has not helped then I think he will stop the drug, if it has improved on anything then we will continue it, so next month will give us either a new out look  to continue or not, we shall see.

"In 2013 I was diagnosed with NSCLC in right upper lobe. Cancer was discoveredp in 2 stages of the lymp nodes. Had 25 treatments of radiation and 5 treatments of chemo. Neither treatments showed shrinkage but tumor did not grow. Had surgery of removal of right upper lobe after treatments. Had CT scan 3 months after surgery and found many small spots of cancer cells in both lungs. Started 150 mg of Tarceva. Had 2 CT since I started Tarceva with great improvement. It is so important to have a positive attitude, stay strong and eat healthy. I go to the YMCA 3 times a week and walk almost every day. Yoga has been a terrific help with improving my breathing and a mind and body balance.  I do get a rash on my face when sitting in the sun or when I eat or drink certain foods. Eyelash get very long and need trimming to avoid dragging against the eyeglass lenses. Facial peach fuzz hair gone but do have some dark hair pop up. I found taking Tarceva in the morning on an empty stomach works best. I was devastated in knowing, as most people are, that I had lung cancer but after seeing so many young people with similar and worse cancer issue I got out of my pity pity me and decided to enjoy ever day that I am given. Stay strong for you are not alone in fighting this terrible disease.    ",5
"Before treatment with Tarceva, I had NO appetite, lost weight rapidly.  Since starting treatment, after about 6 wks, my PET scans showed clearing of tumors, & size reduction.  Side effects are : eyelash thick growth, Eyebrow thick growth, Lines around mouth extending into surrounding skin, Whiteheads around mouth, diarrhea, nail deformity, and splitting.  I have also lost most of my hair. My nose hair growth has increased, very thick & brittle.  However, I feel great, except for increased back pain.  Despite side effects, I feel blessed to have access to this miracle drug, & every month of survival I have because of it.  I am very lucky to not have any serious side effects so far.",5
"3 1/2 weeks on Tarceva my mother died from Tarceva side effects not the lung cancer.  Her skin peeled, bad rash, high fever, food tasted like acid, kidneys shut down.",1
"I have been taking Tarceva 150 mg for almost 5 years now and still on remission the only side effects I have is skin rash that can be painful and diarrhea,otherwise my hair gets thicker ang grow eyelashes",5
The time before taking it and the wait after are most important but are also somewhat an inconvenience. OK if it works.,3
"I have been taking Tarceva for over 4 years now with very good results...Several items to consider- along with early detection, genetic tissue typing of tumor can help identify if this drug could be a benefit to reducing tumor size and growth.  To maintain consistency to take on empty stomach- I keep it by my bedside and take it in the middle of the night when I go to the restroom.  I have had some issues with the rash- 10-25 spots DR prescribed ""clindamycin phosphate topical lotion"" which has helped.  I've had occasional(bad) diarrhea which seems to be triggered by certain foods, especially milk. I've reduce frequency and amount and when really needed- take Imodium! I still eat my ice cream!  I am currently being tested for osteoporosis, and wonder if the medicine leaches calcium out of the bones? And I seem to be slower to heal /recover after strenuous activity- but am still able to jog and ride a bike. So overall I'm pleased with my results.",5
"my wife started on 150 mg tarceva in march 2014. Got extremely tired and couldn't eat. Dr. reduced it to 100 mg in may.mass in rt lung has been reduced some and left lung is stable. still fatigued and gets some facial hair which we use nair for, and rashes on her feet and face we use hydrocortisone cream that takes care of the rashes in a few days.",5

"In April 2014 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 NSCLC.  It had mediatized to my lump nodes and pleural membranes around my lungs; I was functioning with only 1 and a quarter lung capacity. The only symptom I had was a persistent cough for about 3 months, then things changed quickly,  I had trouble breathing and could hardly talk. I am 61 years of age, a nonsmoker, fair sensitive skinned and 124 pounds.  A targeted drug was my best option and Tarceva at 150 mg was prescribed.  On day 8 through to day 21 the side effects started to present and escalated;  a nasty sore  rash all over my head, neck, back and chest -  even  in my ears and nose, diarrhea,  my eyes were burning red, weeping, sore and sensitive to light, FATIQUED, sensitive mouth, hair started to thin out, skin peeled from head to toes. After a 20 day rest, I restarted Tarceva at 75 mg.  As of this writing the side effects are greatly reduced and the liquid surrounding my lung has reduced.  I can breathe and talk normally. ",5
rash gets very bad,4
"My husband was on Tarceva for 2 1/2 months. It made him sick every day. He had stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. He went from two masses on his lung to full lung masses. He was very sick since he started taking it.  He passed away on May 6, 2014.  He went through hell!. I would not recomend Tarceva to anyone. ",1
"On Tarceva for 5 months now. Reduced tumor by over 60% plus took cancer out of the bones and lymph nodes. Side effects are diarrhea, dry skin, and floaters. Upset stomach which I control by eating six small meals per day. Nature's Way Primadophilus Optima (probiotic) eased my stomach and intestine discomfort and should be standard issue with this medication.",4

"Was diagnosed with Stage 4 nsclc in November 2003 and given 2-3 years to live.  Did year and a half of chemo, six months of radiation and six months on Iressa.  Been on Tarceva 150mg for the past 7 years with great success.  No further growth in my plura and no new cancer growth anywhere else.  Life is good!",5
"I have been taking Tarceva 150 for just over 3 months.  After 2 1/2 months, a CT scan showed that the mail tumor in my lung had shrunken considerably, and the small metastases were no longer visible.  Side effects include minor diarrhea, fatigue, dry skin and scalp, hair loss on head and hair growth around the lips. ",5

Lot of facial rash rolblems,3
"On March 27, 2013, my 37th birthday, I was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma. I had a 4 cm tumor on the right top lobe, cancer cells on my plura and in the fluid, as well as active cancer cells in one of my ribs. My amazing doctor, Dr. Richard Gorman, immediately tested me to see if I could take it. On April 19, 2013 as I was getting a port placed, Dr. Gorman called my mom with the great news being able to start Tarceva. So on April 22, 2013 instead of starting chemo I started 150mg of Tarceva. Within 3 weeks my whole face and my scalp was covered  in the rash. My face seriously looked like a pepperoni pizza lol. He took me off, then started me at 100mg to move me up to 125mg. I do have the most irritating rash in my scalp that sometimes goes down my back but other than that it's been smooth sailing. Just did a PET scan August 19, 2013 and it has helped tremendously. My cancer in my rib, gone, 2 spots on my plura gone, and tumor has shrank half a cm. Praise you Jesus! In April I was told 2 to 5 months w/o treatment, and maybe 18 months w/treatment, but w/this success and prayer I am positive I have many years left. Anyone reading this just remember a few things: 1)try to always be positive 2)set goals for your self 3)make future plans and 4)have faith. Bless each and everyone of you reading this no matter who you do or don't pray to.",5
I get severe liquid filled pimples on my scalp. Then they turn into scabs and when the scabs fall off I have large bald spots.. ,1
"I’ve had non small cell lung cancer since early 2012.  I’ve been taking 100 mg of tarceva daily since October, and this arrested the growth of the tumour some months ago.  It remains static and predictions are impossible but I feel well and can live normally.  The regime is three weeks on tarceva, with Imodium to control the diarrhoea and skin sensitivity, and a week off to catch up and take a breather.  It took a bit of experimenting to get this balance.  I’m also taking 2 mg of the steroid dexamethasone and this keeps spirits up, and movement and energy at reasonable levels. So I’d like you to hear the message that the terrifying diagnosis last year was not the end for me, and yours doesn’t need to be for you.  Nobody knows long I will last.  For now – and now might be quite a long time – I’m still here and every day is a joy, with pleasures to seek out.   I feel this is a real choice: is my glass pleasantly half full or miserably half empty?  The evidence is the same for both, so the difference is inside my head, where I can control it if I choose.  Montaigne observed that learning how to live really means learning how to die.  We all must, and learning how to die well must also mean living well until we go.  The choice is between actively facing this conundrum and discovering how to manage it and what to do to deal with the questions, or pretending it won’t happen if you don’t think about it.  Take charge of what you can, or let it sneak up and happen to you, unprepared and denying.    I’m learning a lot about what helps in this situation, and what doesn’t, and I’d really like to share the messages with you who are facing similar situations and working out what to do about them.  I may be a bit further along the journey than you, and able to share useful tips.  Or maybe you’re ahead of me, and can teach me things I’ll need to know. I’ve started a blog on this, and you can find it at http://blog.careersolutions.co.uk. I’d really like ",5
Many minor side affects.  All treatable. Has been 3 1/2 years!,5
"I started 150 MG Tarceva on Jan 10 2005 ATER A LAPOROSCOPY. HAD 1 LOBE REMOVED BECAUSE OF TUMOR GROWTH, HOWEVER ALL OTHER TUMORS (ALL PRIMARY) HAD REMAINED STABLE...TO THIS DAY THE REMAINING TUMORS HAVE NOT GROWN AND I CONTINUE TO TAKE TARCEVA 7 YRS LATER...IS THIS UNUSUAL? OR AM I JUST LUCKY? A LUCKY LADY....Karen Kaufman",5
"My 81 yr old mother was diagnosed with inoperable/couldn't have radiation NSCLC July 2010 and given 6mos - 1yr.  She was in a study Pointbreak and had Alimta and carboplatin for over a yr. In the beginning there was slight shrinkage of tumors.  Due to severe fatigue and loss of appetite and weight loss, mom skipped a chemo and was changed to every 4wks instead of every 3 for the last year and didn't qualify for the study any more. Mom was given Tarceva 100mg in December 2012 taken daily.  She had none of the itchiness/rash or any of the other symptons described in these posts.  Mom was given Tarceva as a last ditch.  On the 27th day, she had an awful diarreah attack (1-8-13) and quit eating and drinking the next day and couldn't drink out of a straw she was so weak. Onc. took her off of Tarceva immed.  She developed an awful raw lesion on one side of her rump and her lungs became diminished ea day. She also had the sticky eyes. She went into a coma like state on 1-10-13 with her mouth wide open and died like that at 10:30 on 1-15-13. Since last CT in Oct showed growth of one of the tumors and tumor markers shot up we encouraged our mother to try this drug.  She always had her wits throughout so she took it fully aware. I think the Tarceva worsened her quality of life and made it MORE difficult for her to breathe. I and my siblings are so regretful we encouraged her to take this drug.",1
"3.5 months on 150mg and stable with a slight reduction in tumor size and less pain in bone meds. Lymph node change unknown just yet. Side effects are manageable. My oncologist had a 1 hour teaching session with me regarding Tarceva, side effects, lotions, hygiene, scheduling, food, etc. I armed myself with all of the lotions and potions before I started and attack each side effect as soon as it emerges. Mostly skin, nail, scalp, diarrhea and fatigue which I can manage and appreciate because of the positive results so far. Good luck to all.",5
"My Mom has been taking Tarceva since November 2011, just came back from getting her results tumor is gone from her right lung. She does have some itching but has been able to control it and had a some bout with rashes.  My Mom was given 10% chance of survival and beating lung cancer. 2011 was an awful year but 2012 has given given hope that she will completely beat this.  Tarceva has her cancer free now. She did have chemo and radiation but after all that she still had the tumor in her right lung.",5
"I've been on Tarceva for 6 months now, have had many side effects, such as diarrhea, pimples on the face and neck, rash on neck,back, under breasts, and legs. Nausea, heart burn, acid reflex, food lacks taste.  No at night with the heart burn, my check and stomach hurt.  Nothing I can't deal with at this time.  Had a CT scan after 3 months, slight improvement.  Will have another at 8 months.",3
"Stage 3 throat Cancer. Three large doses of chemo and 34 radiation treatments. Three weeks of Tarceva, got bad chest and facial rash, and an inflammation of the stomach/intestine area called duadinitis. Lost 20 lbs in a week had severe cramps. Now after 7 weeks of treatment I am cancer free for 10 months. ",4
"I have taken Tarceva for nine months and my CT's show very good results. The side effects are my problem. In addition to the expected advertised side effects, I am on my third severe scalp  problem. The doctor has given me a 10 day and 5day period off the medication and reduced my dosage from 7 days to 5 days a week. My scalp is the only area being effected by this breakout. Do other patients have this problem and is there a solution? ",5
I was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer in Dec. 2010 and took cemotherapy and then was put on Tarceva 100 mg.  The tumor in my right lung has shrunk and is described as scar tissue now. I have back pain because the cancer had spread to my back originally before being diagnosed. I feel that Tarceva has helped me survive as originally I wasn't given much chance.  I have to stop Tarceva occasionally because of the rash and the way it affects my toes.  Sometimes I stay off it 2 weeks at a time and sometimes only a week.  I currently take the pill every other day as I seem to be able to tolerate it better that way.  It seems to build up toxicity in my system--I would have terrible facial rash and diarrhea with bleeding toe nails.  I am grateful for the drug as I feel it has saved my life!! My doctor says that this is the top line treatment for my cancer. 5/16/12,5
"My Hubby was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage IV in 2004. He was 28 years old at the time. His Dr. prescribed him Tarceva as first line treatment due to my husbands refusal to do anything else. After being told he had up to one year to live, I am happy to say he is still alive. Whenever the tumors disappear, he stops taking it because of the side affects. The Dr. did recommend, lower dosage, for maintenance therapy, but my hubby is stubborn and refuses, so the tumors always come back. ( I recommend doing what your Dr. Says to do, keeping in mind you are your number one advocate.) He is currently taking Tarceva for the 4th time in 8 years. So far, everything is looking good. We received his blood work back yesterday and everything is in normal range. ",5
"Diagnosed with Stage 4 NSCLC June 2007.  Six treatments of Taxal/carboplatin and then took Tarceva for 18mos before it stopped working.  Dry skin, cracked cuticles hands/feet.  Have been on Alimta, Taxotere and Gemzar since and have just started Tarceva again.  Original diagnosis was 6-12mos.  My tumor has not grown and no lymph nodes affected.  No growth or changes and am hoping that the Tarceva will carry me along until something new comes on the market. (Age 66, female, non-smoker)",5
Tarceva has given me a new quality of life.  I have battled non-small lung cancer since Oct. 2008. Tarceva is a miracle drug for me.,4
"I'm 37, never smoked a cigarette in my life, diagnosed with metastatic NSCL in Feb 2011 after a series of respiratory infections, pneumonia and a chronic cough. I received chemo for 5 months, my cycles ran 2 weeks on, 1 week off. I initially started Tarceva in July, 150 mgs daily. I didn't do so well as I had the awful facial rash, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite and rapid weight loss.  My oncologist switched to every other day for a few weeks. Currently my dosage is 100 mgs daily.  I am still dealing with the rash (facial, chest, shoulders, and now on below the knees to my ankles). Hydrocortisone cream has helped. My skin is extremely dry and painful. Vanicream gives me some relief. I have neuropathy in my fingers on both hands and fatigue (this has gotten better). I have not had any issues with diarrhea, shortness of breath, eyesight, nose/mouth sores. My last CTs showed that Tarceva is indeed working for me. The tumor in my lung shrunk from 4 cm to 2.5 cm. The lesions in my left and right lungs have become scar tissue or continue to shrink, and the lesions on my brain have turned to scar tissue as well. Even though I do not like the side effects from Tarceva, it is working and has given me a second chance at life. ",4

I was found to have adenocarcinnoma lung cancer in may of 2008. Had surgery to remove top lob on  right side and third rib. I was on tarceva as a second round of chemo. Had to be taken off because of side effects. Put on Alitma now after 1year my pt/cat scan showed two marks on the 4th and 5th rib.This could be residual and showing up now that my body is getting immune to the Alitma or they can be new tumors. I started the Tarceva Nov6th. Now I just wait to see which side effects I get and if the Tarceva will work in getting rid of the tumors. I am told that I am beating the odds now by surviving 2 years. I hope that I can keep it up and survive as long as some of you have. I will update as things happen. ,3
In 2003 I was not expected to live 8 months. I took the chemo for a year until the Tarceva became available in 2004. I have been taking 100 mg for over 5 years. The tumors have been in remission in my lung for 5 years. All check ups satisfactory. As you are aware we are all different. I have the common side effects. I have fatigue and diarrhea side effects along with rash. Heat will aggravate the rash. Hot weather will not be your friend. You may also experience dry skin and nail splitting. For the diarrhea I keep 1 ammonium AD pill in my pocket for those time it becomes a problem.  The longer you use the Tarceva the better you are able to handle the side effects.  This has been a God send for me and my family. I thank God everyday for this medication.,5

I am now on 75mg for a month and have no side effects. Cancer tumors have turned to scar tissue. I thank God everyday for blessing me that I am still alive and feel healthy. I pray that it continues to work. I am interested to know how long one can take this medication without it harming other parts of the body.",5
"non-small cell lung cancer, surgery; metastatic to ribs, surgery; spine, radiation & surgery. I have been on tarceva for 1 year so far it seems to be working. No complications except at the begin with the pimples were terrible. However last month the Dr. said looking at the CT the tumors in the lungs might be growing a little bit. Will now also be on zometa.",5
Been on Tarceva for about 6 months now and could not be happier with the results. Tarceva has killed a spot of carcinoma that was on my right ear. Have learned how beat the rash and fatigue. You can contact me and I'd be more then happy to help you to get over the rash too. [email protected],5
"My 89 mother is taking Tarceva for the last 5 1/2 months.  Her biggest problem is the skin on her legs, back of neck and scalp is breaking down.  She has large opened sores.  Has anyone else experienced this?  The tumors in her lungs are slowly shrinking.  She started on 150MG but her eyes and nose became infected, so she is now on 100MG.  It's an effective drug if you can tolerate it.   If anyone needs help financially with  Tarceva, contact Genentech- the manufacturer.  My mom doesn't pay anything for this drug.  God Bless!",5
"My mom, 48 yrs old nonsmoker, was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC met to the brain in 5/2009. She stated Tarceva 150mg 1/23/10 and had an extreme allergic reaction from the 1st pill. She broke out in hives within 45 mins and then half an hour after that she got dizzy, fell, violently vomited, both arms went numb, and had seizure like shakes. We took her to the ER. She had an allergic reaction and now cannot take the drug. Has anyone else had this allergic reaction?",1
"After a week and a half with no problems, and high hopes, my eyes began to itch and were very swollen, esp. in the morning.  My face felt like it was on fire.  Ice packs helped.  I went in to see the nurse and she said my ""rash"" was not at all typical, discontinue the drug for now.  I had very high hopes and am still hoping my oncologist will find a way to make this work.  The itchy, sandpaper eyes and the darkened skin around the eyes were very  uncomfortable.  Benedryl helped, too.",2
"my husband was on Tarceva and Gemzar for Stage IV pancreatic cancer. He developed a very bad rash, which should indicate that the drugs were working -- NOT! The side effects were pretty tolerably; he was on pain meds so that balanced out the diarrhea. Pancreatic cancer is just a horrible disease; my husband passed away last week, 6 months after diagnosis. ",1
"My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic cancer.  After 4 session of Gemzar chemo with no reduction in tumor size and increasing 19-9 counts, the oncologist recommeded the usage of Tarceva in conjunction with the Gemzar. Reading the information in the package was scary enough for my my mom - indicated that pancreatic cancer patients taking this medication in conjuction with standard chemo lived, on average, 2 weeks longer.  But, trying to maintain positive and beat the odds of her terrible disease, my mom began the medication.  Within days she experienced a severe rash all over her face.  All self esteem she had was destroyed.  Until that point, she did not look like a sick person and was able to continue with her job as normal. She immediately discontinued usage, and her rash was gone a month later.  Though she remained alive for another 12 weeks, I am sure the Tarceva was the turning point for her with her disease; it dimished the positive attitude required to combat this condition. Pancreatic cancer patients -please speak frankly with your oncologist about the pros and cons of this drug.",1
"this medication is noted to create a rash if its working,which of coarse we (my husband and I)were hoping for, but in our case we developed a very serious infection from it so we had to stop it.",2
"This Medication was prescribed for stage IV NSCLC after failure of chemo and radiation when diagnosed in stage 3b.  The side of effects of this med are tough, facial rash, dry skin, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  This med was unafective in this case.  I was told that the drug works best on never before smokers, or with the genetic markers that are characteristic of Asian females.  Please use caution with this drug.  If it works for you - God Bless.  If it does'nt show results, then don't punish yourself.  I think this med is overated, and certainly overpriced.  My advise is to discuss this fully with your oncologist.  Best of Luck to those with this terrible disease.",1

So far the diarrhea is somewhat manageable with Immodium.  I do not have much of an appetite and cannot sleep very well due to the burning of my face, eyes, scalp, etc.  I will have a follow-up ct scan in 3 weeks.  I don't know if I can live with this terrible rash.  I have been told to use hydro-cortisone cream with an equal part of vaseline, but it burns even more.

MY HUSBAND WHO IS 80 YEARS OLD WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH NSCLC. HE HAS BEEN ON THIS MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTHS AND IT IS WORKING WELL SO FAR. HIS ONLY SIDE EFFECT SEEMS TO BE EXCESSIVE DROOLING. I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE ELSE HAD THAT SIDE EFFECT? HE HAS NO RASH NO DIARRHEA JUST THE DROOLING ISSUE.,5
"I have been on Tarceva for 7 months. At first, I had a manageable rash and diarrhea. Now my rash is severe, but the diarrhea is almost gone. My dosage has been cut to try to solve the rash problem. However, my tumor counts are almost at zero, so I'm encouraged. ",5
"I was diagnosed stage IV in May 08, 3 cycles of chemotherapy.  Went on Tarceva in September 08.  Bone tumors appear to be gone, lung tumor is 1/2 size.  Very few side effects.  At first this drug worked very fast in reducing my tumors, now is steady.  I hope this continues and have confidence in the drug. ",5
Working very slow but helping,4
"I had 1/2 lung removed and went thru chemo and radiation and then in Dec 07 went on 150 mg of Tarceva, in Dec 08 changed to 100 mg due to rash, cracked finger tips.  I have been cancer free since the surgery, still have diarear problems, but I can handle it.  Very grateful and blessed to have this med. Have had 3 PET scans since starting and still cancer free.",5
"I've been on Tarceva just over 9 months.  for NSCLC.  Started with 3 tumors.  One is  gone, one is now scar tissue and one is reduced to 5mm.  Used Elidel for rash and put up with other side effects.  I just stopped for 2 months to give me body and chance to recoup.  Next CT scan 6/11, if  tuor is still 5mm I'll wait to go back, please pray for me.  So far this has been a miracle.",5
"I began Tarceva once daily. At the end of the 7th day of dosage, severe rash on face, neck and upper chest region. Diarreha (sp.) decrease in taste, mouth sores, very dry skin, skin on feet would peel off in small sheets like paper, irritation in swallowing (small sips of drink and small bits of food for comfortability in eating). Pain and dryness in eyes, with minor neuropathy, banging in ears, nervousness. Doctor rescheduled my dosage every third day.  This seem was easier on body, but side effects did not disappear, continued side effects in smaller proportion.  Time on Tarceva, 6 months.  I am currently off Tarceva, until June which a CT Scan will be taken to see how cancer is ""stewing"". I am also having ""withdrawal"" symptoms from Tarceva, eyes are not so painful, nerves and fatigue are issues now.  Pace myself daily with daily chores, walks, does help. Naps are a necessity in afternoon due to these effects.  I have been challenged with cancer now for ll years,  I'm still breathing and still here on God's great earth.  My cancer was finally given a name at Dana Farber in Boston called Thymoma Cancer (from the Thymus Gland in center of chest)  It surely has been a ""ride"" all these years, but i have been fortunate that my cancer has not spread.  It has made its home in my left chest region as well as my center chest region with several lesions.  Hang in there guys! God loves you and so do I !",2

"I have a sister who was diagnosed with lung cancer back in May 2008 and doctors recommended Tarceva 150 mg daily. The medication did nothing except drain our pocket of US4250, yes this what we used to pay every month in Lebanon hoping it will help her or at least reduce  the pain or prevent the cancer from spreading . She passed away on January 27 2009. I hope all other patient with lung cancer will survive and live long.  In memory of my sister Fawzieh ",1
"Had severe rash and accompanied with itch/burn on face with 150mg; reduced to 100mg. Presently, face and body skin very dry but controlled by prescriptions, ulcers in mouth and eye, also controlled by prescription.  Just started to notice face hair after approx. 2 months of use.",3
"i just started tarceva, about two weeks ago.i would rather do this then chemo.the only down fall is the rash and mouth sores.the mouth sores were the worst.i didnt eat for two days. stoped taking it for a few days. now back on it. ",4
"I am non smoker diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in the spring of 2007.  My tumor could only be treated by chemo.  After first treatment the cancer was quiet for about 10 months.  I couldn't tolerate the 2nd round of chemo.  My oncologist started me on 150mg of Tarceva.  I had a severe skin rash, mouth & nose sores, etc. after 5 days on the drug.  He immediately stopped treatment, I recovered in 5 days.  He lowered the dose to 100mg, I take it for 5 days and off 2 each week. I have been able to tolerate it quite well after 6 mos. When started cancer was agressive and had spread to other lung and in my chest.  After starting Tarceva, the first CAT scan showed all cancer cleared up except for the original tumor, which has been progressively decreasing since.  I do have a fatigue that comes and goes with other slight side effects.  So far this drug is truly saving my life.  I thank God for it.",5
Have been taking this medication less than a month and would like any help anyone can offer on helping to subside the side effects of the skin rash.,4
It has gotten rid of small tumors on my liver.,4
How blessed I am.  Have been on Tarceva for6 months.  No side effects at all.  My CT scans are great.  I feel good and am very lucky.,5
Convenient to use.  Temor  has been stable for two years now.  Side effects can be managed. The most inconvenient side effect has been diahrehia but managed with Immodium.,5
"major problem is the diarare and skin rash, my biggest problem is I don't like to drink water, and my finger tips crack and bleed.",5
I have only been using this drug for a few months I have experienced the side effects of the rash.   I have used  creme to help the rash go away or at least not very noticable and diarrhoea which I have been able to control with Loperamide.  I only wish that this drug is available on the NHS as my insurance company will only pay for the drug until December (another 3 months) and I feel that this drug is working exceptionally well for me - its keeping me alive,4
"I have been diagnosed with displasia of the lining of the mouth. I started the drug sept 9 2008, it took 4 days for any symptoms of the drug to appear. Unfortunally hurricane IKE was hitting shore on the 5th day. By the 8th day of taking the drug symptoms were severe Rash bleeding on face and checst, diareaha after eating, 101 fever. ended up with cellulitis, kidneys near failure, ICU for 5 days 8 days total stay after 3 week still have rash 2000 white heads on my face alone. Be VERY CAREFULL with this drug. report any symptoms to your doctor immedately as they can turn severe with in 24 hrs. This drug helps many people it just will not work with my body. If you have to take this drug remain in close contact with your doctor and have a plan fi you cannot get intouch with your doctor. Notify your emergency room and have them keep a file on this drug as many doctors know nothing about this drug. Good luck to you",1
I started taking Tarceva in Sept 2005.  At first I was taking 150 mg but my doctor reduced it to 75 mg because of the extreme diarrhea and terrible rash on my face.  I am still taking it (September 2008) and although I still have problems with diarrhea I am alive and still working.  I will be 68 in October and have been able to enjoy my life and see my grandchildren grow.  I am married to a wonderful man and we enjoy life and each other.  I do not know how long this will all last but I know that without the Tarceva I probably would not be alive.  I have a PET scan every six months and will be due again in November.  I will try to write you again and tell you how I am doing.,4
"My father had mesothelioma.He had been taking other chemo and improving.When the improvement slowed and then stopped,he was switched to Tarceva.In three weeks,he was dead.He lost several pounds a week,had explosive diarrhia,and suffered from dehydration,even while taking in a normal amount of water.The drug was stopped,but the problems continued.The first two weeks he had no strong reaction other than weight loss,but the last week devastated him,the onset of severe adverse reactions taking place in less than a day,and continuing even after the drug was stopped.Remember,Tarceva is a drug of last resort,but if the doctor prescribing it isn't very attentive to the reaction of the patient,it can be very deadly,very quickly.This occurred in southeast Virginia,so if you are using an oncologist in this area,remember that some of them aren't very up to date on the side effects and aren't too attentive to patients using this drug,sometimes not even returning calls.Use extreme caution in taking this drug,and make sure the doctor will be available to the patient immediately if adverse reactions occur,as time is short between onset and fatal adverse reaction to the drug.",1
"My mom, who is 85 years old, has been on Tarceva for l year now and is doing great. This has been the only treatment she has had.  She is only on 100mg, and her latest catscan has shown, slow growing....Wonderful for my mom as well as her family....",5
"My wife was diagnosed with NSCL on May 2, 2006 stage IV. She had the standatd chemotherapy for about 2 months, then after a break, she had 15 Radiation treatments on her lower spine (5th Lumbar). then she was place on a study using Avastin IV and Tarceva oral (150mg). She has been on this combo for over 1 year. overall, it has stopped the growth of the tumor in her lung-the radiated tumor never came back. However, the neuropathy she experiences is sometimes overwhelming- coughing, sneezing hurt her, her hands and feet have always tingled and hurt-sometimes quite a lot. Nothing has been effective to reduce this problem. Her Dr.receintly stopped the Tarceva after she ecperienced so many of the side effects all at once. Weight loss, rash(s), mouth sores, split lip/ finger tips. after being off of the drug for 5 days, she returned to normal. After two weeks the Dr. put her back on the drug at a lower dose 100 mg vs 150mg. She experienced rectal bleeding two weeks ago so the Dr stopped the every three week dose of Avastin-a Colonoscopy has been scheduled... the latest problem is Foot-drop. But the real important thing is that the combination of the two drugs do work. She had CT scans about every 6 weeks and they always show that the tumor is stable-no growth. and there is no growth anywhere else!",5

not working well,4
Used a q tip to put on and it worked very well and very quickly I have mycosis fungoides so I am very happy that it works so well in combination with UVB phototherapy.,5

Diagnosed in 1988. Autologous bone marrow transplant 2001. Have taken many drugs from Hydrea to Interferon. I was on Gleevec and responded well but I had very bad side effects. I was switched to Tasigna 400 mg 2x a day and its worked for the past 8 Years! The side effects for me have been itching over the entire body and loss of body hair that breaks as it comes out of the skin and forms bumps that look like a rash. Lotions only bring temporary relief for itching but nothing stops the hair loss. I've been extremely fortunate with minimal side effects when compared to any other treatments. Its been my miracle.  ,5
"I have had CML for five years. Was on Gleevec first six months and could not tolerate the nausea. Oncologist started me on Tasigna. The twice a day regimen requires planning, for me taking the first dose when I wake up helps. I started with 400 twice a day and had extreme fatigue, weakness, depression, anemia, and insomnia. I'm also hot all of the time and have developed psoriasis. I have been able to reduce my dosage over the past 3.5 years and the side effects have improved. Make sure you have an oncologist that you trust and who listens. Switching to a blood cancer specialist really helped. ",5
"First side effect:, my nipples started itching,then they got very stiff and started hurting if I touch them.Six weeks later I started feeling tired and my erection started to get weak.I visited a uroligist and had my testosterone level checked -it was low.I have started hormone treatment but once every two weeks but the level keep dropping.At this point I am on an increased dosage once a week.",5
"I've been taking this drug for over 5 yrs.,  after gleevec didn't work & with my very good Drs. adustments, I thank God I'm still living with CML after 32 years.",4
"CURRENTLY AM VERY SATISFIED WITH tasigna, HOWEVER, WHAT ARE THE LONGTERM SIDE EFFECTS?",5
"I have been on this medication as part of a research protocol for almost 4 years. The side effects are minimal so far, compared to Gleevec that I was first on for about a month when first diagnosed. The main problem is taking on an empty stomach 12 hours apart. Also the site states to take 1 hour after or 2 hours before food, however it should state 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.",5
"this pill was hard to work out to keep 12 hours apart on an empty stomach. 29 days from starting this drug I became very short of breath, oxygen dropped and was in the hospital for a week with pneumonia which the doctors beleive was caused by the drug.",1
Was on Gleevac for 8 years. Started seeing signs of it not working. No side effects with Tasigna and am in complete remission.,5
"Thankful for this medication, especially after experiencing difficulties with gleevec.  The only side effects I notice that are dismissed by my doctor is a loss of SENSE of SMELL.  The doctor refuses to believe this is a side efect- but that is the tasigna is the only thing I began taking when the loss of sense of smell occurred.  They need to address this-- I would still use the tasigna regardless of this loss of sense!",5
I find the eating regimen difficult.,4
"I have been on this for 3 months and I have noticed increased irregular heartbeats, moreso when lying down.  This has been very scary since heart disease runs in my family.  I was told by an oncology counselor to take this med 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating but now I am reading the opposite.  That may be why going to sleep is so frightening!  I'm taking this med the wrong way!  No vomiting or dizziness.  And fatigue is not too bad.  So overall, this medicine is truly lifesaving for me.",5
"48yo African American Female who experience the following side effects with 2 days of taking Tasigna:  1.  Constant Headache 2.  Severe Abdominal pain 3.

Severe cramps in hands, mostly right hand, and feet. 3.  Weight gain 4.  Lack of energy  Will return to Gleevec 200mg instead of 400mg and pray for better results.

"In 2006 I had a Near Death Experience with a 60% Blast Crisis at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after Gleevec failed. I was on it since 2002.  I got on Tasigna immediately after the NDE and it was Heaven! I never looked back.  Gleevec caused brain damage to my pain receptors, so I'm on Morphine three times daily. That's a tough one to manage!  But for Tasigna I can't say enough good about it and MD Anderson. If you have Cancer get to them immediately. They are the World leader in Cancer for 7 years!",5
"I am in remission, because of the tasigna,but i need to keep taking tasigna. I'm experimenting side effects that my drs say not because of tasigna. What Da...

"I began taking Tasigna about 1 month after it was approved. It has been so much better than the 2 I had taken before. I recently began having many health issues which I only just learned are due to the side effects listed on this site. I probably have about 90% of them. I jsut wished someone would have told me about the side effects, as I have recently thought that my time was drawong near. That was very scary.",5

My husband died 15 days after receiving this toxic stuff. Started deteriorating about ten days after treatment; had to be taken to the hospital as could not breathe. Lived for four more days in ICU. Came to the hospital with extremely low blood pressure and not one white blood cell. This stuff should be outlawed.,1
"I went through 18 weeks of Taxol, with carboplatin added every 3rd treatment. Chemo ended Feb 2016 and the neuropathy keeps getting worse. I fell right before my last treatment because of the lack of feeling in my feet and broke both my ulna and radius which required surgery. My neuropathy is not improving, it's getting worse. My feet and hands are always tingling with needles poking into them. I must walk with a cane to avoid falling not to mention the pain that messes with my days and disrupts my sleep. This medication should be removed from the approved list.",1
"10 minutes into the first treatment my mother had a serious allergic reaction.  IT Stopped her heart and she was basically dead and was revived thankfully. She spent 4 days in the hospital. she is very active and seems to be in normal health,  but she vowed to never try chemo again because of this! IT WAS a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!",1
"I was being treated for invasive ductile breast cancer in 1 breast. I had a double mastectomy as my other breast had a mass that came back as atypical, but not cancer. I had cancer in one of my lymph nodes. I can't comment on effectiveness as this treatment had to be stopped after 2 of 4 infusions due to severe nerve damage. I had four (4) infusions of AC (every 14 days) with no major problems. After first taxol I had a rash on my face and head within half an hour after treatment. Within a week I had shingles. After the second treatment my blood counts were low and the 3rd treatment was delayed for one week. However, when I went for the 3rd treatment my oncologist stopped the chemo because by that time I had trouble walking from the nerve damage in my toes and feet. Also severe tingling/numbness in my hands and fingers and on the left side of my lips and tongue. I had dizziness and vertigo. I fell twice (not from dizziness but my legs just gave out). I had muscle aches in my legs so that I could hardly walk. I lost my appetite, and I was extremely constipated. It is now about 6 weeks from when chemo was stopped (and that was 3 weeks after my second infusion) and I can now hold a pen and write, but my fingers and hands are still tingly. My feet and toes are still numb and tingly and I still have no appetite. I walk 30 minutes a day as per suggestion of my oncologist, but I do so with my husband as I lose my balance and am unsteady at times. I am still constipated and take miralax at least once or twice a week. Though not as severe, my tongue and lips are still tingly and I can only taste certain foods. My oncologist told me that if I had had more taxol, I might not be able to walk.",1
"I had DCIS Stage IIA breast cancer.  I first received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, four infusions every other week via a port.  After those infusions, I started what was supposed to be four infusions of paclitaxel every other week.  Immediately after the first infusion I had, and reported to my oncologist, numbness in my hands and feet.  The same thing happened after the second and then the third infusions.  The numbness increased with each infusion.  The numbness was so profound by the time I had received the third infusion that I went to my oncology visit ready to refuse the fourth (scheduled) infusion.  The oncologist decided to stop the infusions, but it was too late.  I am now ten months past my last infusion, and the CIPN has not resolved in the slightest.  I am very resentful that my oncologist did not adjust the protocol in any way during my treatment with this drug.  I stopped seeing her and am now seeing a different oncologist.",3
"My husband started Taxol 5 days ago.  Earlier chemo has not hit him like this one. He said he feels like he has been hit by a truck...every bone & muscle in his body hurts. He is so weak and fatigued from it that he sleeps a lot, and even that is hard for him to do with the pain.  He was advised not to take any pain meds. like tylenol, aspirin, aleve, etc., because they counteract the chemo, but I am going to ask assistance from ""palative care"" for opioids if necessary to help him with the pain. My heart aches for him.  I so hope the CANCER is being killed in the process...if so, I guess it will be worth it.  ???",2
"After 1st treatment, I had severe, mind-numbing bone pain for 5 days.  Ten minutes into the 2nd infusion (today), I had an alarming allergic reaction, which brought nurses and my oncologist running.  They stabilized me with more IV steroids and oxygen.  They didn't continue the taxol Tomorrow morning they will give me ALL the stuff that reduces allergic reactions, then give me taxol slowly with oxygen and steroids at the ready.  I hope it works- I don't want to change my treatment and lose ground because I only have 2 out of 8 chemos left. (4 AC and 4 T) Breast cancer- grade 2A/ IDC/ ER+, PR+",2

"The first couple days I feel fine after treatment. My first treatment my legs ached bad, tired, and just felt bad after my second treatment I started having sever tingling and itching (neuropathy) in my hands, feet and vaginal area. Had to skip my 4th treatment for body to heal. ",4
"This is the most toxic drug i have ever have had put in my body. I had such a severe reaction my hair blew away literally the day after my 1st infusion, that's getting ahead of myself! I broke out in massive hives from top of head to tip of toes i had to go on heavy steroids, then scratch my skin off for 2 wks. To top it all off, my legs started to feel painful and numb, then my hands and feet then up my legs! Well guess what I developed NEUROPATHY AFTER THE ONE DOSE OF THIS CHERNOBYL COCTAIL!!! Then on to doxirubicin, it's now 2 yrs later and I'm a 2 time survivor, with double mastectomy. Neuropathy, from Taxol, and heart problems from doxyrubicin. Make sure u know what you are having put in ur body! Weigh pros and cons. Be an advocate for ur own health, ask ???. Write everything down, or bring somebody with you to visits and have them take notes. Read all about meds before you take them. Tell ur doc u want full disclosure of everything!!! Good luck.God bless. Hope for a cure.",1
I just started it on yesterday it was my first day.,5
"Orig. dx with mets to spine.Did A&C when first diagnosed and made it through okay, but was very happy when it was over and had a complete response. Took aromatase inhibitors for 1 year, then PET showed mets in chest wall and liver.  Took Taxol with minimal S/E; annoying neuropathy in feet was the worst part but tolerable.  PET after 6 months showed NED! But the very next month an MRI showed tumors in my chest wall again and now, just 3 months later, a new spot on my liver.  So Taxol worked well for me and I tolerated it well, but it worked only briefly. Now I start Xeloda. Hope it works and lasts a lot longer than Taxol. ",3

when i was on taxol the tumors stayed the same size after switching to a different drug they have enlarged,3
"Tumor es getting small. is my 5th. doses and don't feel bad. I loss hair, a feel sometime tired. But so far no bad I hope is work for me.",3
Was using Abraxane but became very ill. My oncologist changed my treatment to Taxol. So far I am a lot less ill.  Just have had flushing of the face on the second day only. Oherwise not much trouble.,5
"hurting in feet cannot walk,neurothy, have stop for awhile start back with lower dose,cancer has shrunk with taxol, a swelling of legs and hands have occured",1
"I found this drug very challenging. I developed terrible burning pain all over my body which worsened with any amount of touch.Neurontin helped somewhat but I suffered quite a bit until the treatments were finished. I am still on Neurontin four months after finishing 4 Taxol treatments over 8 weeks. After two courses I asked my oncologist if I could switch to weekly treatments to complete the course, but I did not choose to do that fearing that it would compromise the efeectiveness of the overall chemo regimen. If I had this to do over, I don't think I could tolerate this drug again because of the hyperesthesia.",4
"This is my first Taxol treatment. I have been diagonosed with stage IV spinL nd lymph node cancer.   The first treatment seems to be fine; no nausia, no weakness. But, I have had the need to take a bowl movement medication. This worked so well that I feel better and am able to do the normal things a women and loving wife should do - -  no sex however.  My husband has been my best friend, is very supportive and very attentive to my needs.   Sometimes he just does things that I thought he would never do - he is a great husand!  Shirley A. Rexin",4
"I was given 12 weekly infusions of Taxol through a port, after having been through 4 AC infusions given every other week.  I first had a mastectomy and axillary node dissection with 2 nodes testing positive for breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma.  The AC portion of chemotherapy was pretty horrible, leaving me nauseous for several days each time and resulting in complete hair loss and lowered blood counts.  The Taxol was so much better by comparison!  No nausea, only some neuropathy in my feet that I can handle, especially considering the benefits of Taxol for those of us who are triple-negative.  It has been 3 1/2 weeks since my last treatment and I feel very good, only a bit of remaining neuropathy.  I think a big part of minimizing side effects is remaining active.  I walk vigorously 6 days a week, 3 miles a day, at a local mall and was strength-training 5-6 days a week before chemo, which I hope to resume soon.  I was at my goal weight when diagnosed and was in good health, which I'm sure helped.  I kept walking throughout my 20 weeks of chemo treatments, except for the days of overwhelming nausea.  I also saw my blood counts rebound in a big way when I resumed taking multi-vitamin supplements plus extra magnesium and calcium every day during treatment.  I had been forgetting them, but making sure to take them daily helped so much.",4
"42 yo Mother of 3 girls.  Diagnosed with St. 2 breast ca at 29weeks pregnancy.  Held off on chemo 'til after elective delivery at 35 weeks.  Started Taxol weekly x 12 the next day.  Get chemo on Thursday afternoons.  Little foggy on Fridays and quite fatigued 11am for few hours every day of weekend.  Then back to work as usual Monday-Thursday.  Peripheral neuropathy of both feet started suddenly on treatment #6 when I went had treatment while a little dehydrated.  Felt like frostbite for a week.  Got better next week with decreased dosing, then returned to normal dose and now some mild tingling of all toes all the time.  Fatigue was worse with last few treatments.  Mild nausea toward end, never needed meds for it.  Lost hair throughout and finally shaved head after 9 weeks.  Treatments went just as oncologist had expected--overall some fatigue, but with 3 little ones, hard to take naps.  Was not a bad experience or anything to fear!  Going on to A/C and nervous about  possible increased nausea and low white counts.  This reverse order of chemo allowed me to be a healthier Mommy for a while and gave me a little time to recover after my third daughter's birth!  Just finished the 12 weeks 3 days ago.  Went to museums all day with my sister-in-law today in NYC.  Chin up!  You'll get through this!",5
"Once a week treatment following four biweekly treatments of AC.  Taken with steroids that interrupt my sleep the night after chemo.  Neuropathy in my hands and feet has improved from the AC, although my fingernails have continued to deteriorate. Nails and hands are much less painful. I am really tired the third day out and tired (but less so) day four and five. I have flu like symptoms (aches, sweats, chills) most days on Taxol/Herceptin. Tylenol relieves these symptoms.  I also get a slight allergic type reaction. My eyes burn and water, runny nose with an unproductive irritated kind of cough. Benadryl and Claritin help. None of it is too awful. Better than rotting from the inside out with cancer.    ",3
"I have been receiving weekly Taxol, which has helped prevent neuropathy. My main side effects are fatigue and anemia.",5
"After my ac chemo, I was started on Taxol. My first treatment left me in pain. The reduced it to half dose every week with same effects. I am a year out and have horrible nerve damage, eye sight problems and constant pain in my entire body. My short term memory was also affected. Was told by my oncologist, these are all permanent and have to live with them for the rest of my life. I too am in pain management.",1
mostly the numbness in my hands and feet. i found out that this may go away or it may not.,4
i got 4 treatments of taxol after 4 rounds of ac taxol was easier then the ac no nausea,5
I cannot rate the effectiveness since I am only through 1/2 of the treatment.,2
"this is my treatment after 8 weeks every other week of a/c. I will have 12 wks every other week of taxol.next day was great. after that its been awful the tingling and can harly walk, I hope it gets better and goes away",4
"I have triple negative BC that returned in my lympnodes. I was told not much time left for me, but if I used taxol it may help extend it.I pretty much knew what to expect because of the first time. What I didn't expect was the side effects from the steroids and other drugs that they have to give you with it, like insomnia, the whole next day and night being wired out and then the fatigue and complete weariness that goes with it, all by the third day thru to the next chemo, but the worse was the depression it was making me fall into because of lack of sleep and how extremely tired I was. It got worse with each chemo, which is once a week for three weeks and one week off. I had no real quality of life for my family and I work everyday. Luckily for me I told my doctor what was going on and she started me on the Taxol with Abraxene instead of the steroids and things have gotten alittle better. I am now starting to sleep better (still have days I can't sleep and I take sleeping pills everyday), I am not wired out after chemo, I still get fatigue and I get tired out very easy but I don't have the depression anywhere near to what I had had. I still have my down days but at least now it is alot more tolerable and manageable than before. My biggest thing is that the doctor has added Avastin to my regiment of drugs and I am scared to death of it, especially after the FDA wanting to withdraw its approval. Any words on this or suggestions? ",4
i was told by my dr that this was the easier chemo after completing 2 hard ones i think he lied bad! i think it was as bad as the red devil ever thought about dread ive got 3 more to go,2
I was supposed to take this drug 4 times after I did a c . I made it through 2 treatments sicker than anyone should ever  have to be and ended up in ICU with a heart attack and low red blood count. I got 2 stents and 3 pints of blood. It felt like the worst flu I have ever had and I still have chemo brain from it. I took it in Jan 2010 and fianally had my modifed radical breast surgery 3 weeks ago. It is early June 2010 now. This drug will either kill you or cure you! All in all I would never take it again I dont think but it did do its job they have told me.,4
"Having Breast Cancer was bad enough but the Taxol was the worst part. I made it through the A&C part with no real issues other than not being able to stand the smell of food cooking and the hair loss was pretty traumatic. The taxol caused my hands and feet to burn it became intolerable after the 2nd treatment. I continued with the treament even though it was hard for me because my Dr wanted to put me on Taxitre which could have been worse for me, I was not going to start from the beginning with a new medication. This was the olnly time in my treatment that I had to take pain meds, Morphine to be exact. I now have all sorts of issues with pain and my hands. I'm a mess but I'm still alive. I was able to get Disability I was turned down twice and then I got an attorney and I got it; it took about 21/2 yrs. to get it but I have it now and that's one less thing for me to worry about. Joining a Breast Cancer group really did help. I suggest going to a group these women know what your going through it's very important to let all your fears and pain. I became a Reach to Recovery Volunteer.",3
"i have had 5 rounds of taxol (3 on 1 off ) it caused tolable heartburn, change of taste but the worse part was the leg and feet pain. numbness, aching, sharp shooting pain ,cold, unable to walk.pain not releived by narcotics.dicontinued it last week, still pain same, afraid it will last,wasn't told that side effect!",2
"I have terrible problems with peripheral neuropathy, horrible pain & pressure underneath my fingernails & toenails. The medication was successful in treating my cancer but the side effects are bad & will effect the quality of my life forever--but it beats the alternative!",5
My wife is only in the beginning of this drug.   she is in her 3rd week every week.  Only thing at this point is a drop in her blood count.  She was on AC for the last 12 weeks.  She has lost her hair. Otherwise doing great,5
"This medicine was nightmare.  I took only one treatment and was so sick they had to cancel my second treatment.  I had hives from head to toe, vomiting, diareah, tingling in my fingers, wide eyes zombie looking, lost all of hair, lost 20 pounds, prayed everytime I wanted to sip water, I still live on Immodium and it's been over 3 weeks since the treatment.  Most of these side effects lasted 12 to 17 days.  I refuse to take it again.  I had every allergic reaction possible.  When they were giving it to me I woke from a sound sleep all flush and couldn't breathe.  The put me on oxygen and pumped me full of benadryl and it took 2 hours to pull me out of the reaction and they still gave me the rest of it.  And still want to give me more...no way.",1
"I just celebrated My 1 year surgery, removal of Fallopian tube,with matastasis to exterior of Bladder. Post-op 3 weeks I began Taxol+Carbo IV. every Four weeks. Three days after each treatment, The Leg, Back and feet pain and spasms, unbearable. I had Percocet(2) q 4-6 hours.Plus meds for nausea. My Husband is disable and did not understand my feelings. I felt all alone. My Oncologist was very supportive. Six monhs after Chemo and 6 weeks of Radiation, I still have pain in feet and Back still extreamly tired. Thank God I can tell someone.",3
uncontrol  urine bladder holding power,3
"I have had 6 treatments. I get the infusions 3 weeks in a row and then a week ""off"". The original plan was to follow this for 4 rounds. I am also getting Avastine the 1st and 3rd infusion of each round. At this point, don't know if it is helping.  Initially I had terribly joint pain in my knees and very weak.  This occured 2 days after the infusion and generally lasted 2 days.  With the last 3 treatments, I have not had the joint pain so much, but have been VERY weak, tired, sleepy and short of breath.  Hoping it continues to just last 2 days.   Lost the hair about 2 weeks after the first treatment.  Now I am finding that my sense of taste is failing. No numbness. Heartburn is pretty much constant if I don't take Tagamet and intermittant diarehea that has been controlled with Immodium. I have not gotten a port but it is getting too hard to find a vein so, getting a port next week.  I had hoped to avoid that.  If this works, it is worth it....  I have been able to continue to work.",3
"Completed 12 treatments Apr 09.  Took treatment on Thurs. and was down thru Sunday. Worked Mon, Tues, Wed. Office Job, with very little energy and found myself forgetting things (very understanding boss).  Already had osteoarthritis in knees before treatment, so it made it worse. Nausea & bloating feeling the day of and day after treatment. Wiped out for 3 1/2 days.  Feet and Toes numb, but medication for neuropothy counteracted my reflux medication, so stopped neurontin.  Four months since last treatment, feet and toes still numb and have spells of feeling freezing cold.  Energy slowing returning. All in all, if cancer doesn't come back, worth it.",3
"My father started taking Taxol in April 2009 for small cell lung cancer that has spread to adrenal area.  Initially, the cancer responded to treatment.  However as time progressed, it stopped responding and my father experienced neurological problems similar to a stroke.  He cannot use the right side of his body.  It is totally weak.  He started experiencing the weakness in May 2009.  Though he did not lose his hair, he lost his functioning and mobility.  Please be mindful when the oncologist recommends this drug.   ",2
4 treatments of this med. Finished in 5/09.  Still having pain in bones and joints; memory issues. First time on the net for info-I feel somewhat better knowing the effects of the taxol are not all in my head.  Thank you all very much!,3
"I don't know if I'm the only person that is going through this but my legs,feet,and back hurt me tremendously now. I have to go to pain management now because the Taxol has gotten into my bones and there are days I can barely walk or function for that matter.I wonder if anyone else has had this effect on them from the use of taxol?",5
"2nd time on taxol had it in 2003 for first time the leg pain would last 4 days out of 7 of the duration of treatment, but at the time i was only 40 years old bounced back went back to very hard factory job and in 2008 breast cancer mastise to several areas of body, hip bones lower spine, should, liver, lungs. started taxol 05/26/2009 for another round 3 weeks on one off for 24 weeks with zyometo as bone helper. the cancer in my hip shattered my hip bone before i could start chemo i will try to keep an  update for others to decide if this is the way to go. first time side effects went away, i was given 6 months if this does not work, 2 years or more if it does, i want to live at least 10 more so i will try this or anything for a longer life ",3
MY sister used it to treat cancer. now shes been cancer free for 9 years!,5
"I have metastatic breast cancer. This is my 2nd time using taxol. 6 years ago, I had the pain in my hips, back & legs - not tht big of a deal. I'm in month 5 of my 6 month regiment and I've recently developed a terrible rash & swelling on my face and hands. The pain in my hands is terrible. Last week my tongue, throat & roof of my mouth swelled & ended up in ER. 3 more taxol treatments to go (hopefully)  Ouch - this stuff hurts...",4
"My husband took this form of chemotherapy for treatment of stage 4 malignant melanomma that has metasised to basically every area of his body. Previously he had been treated with interferon (the most horrible chemotherapy ever invented), DCIT, several radiation treatments and Temodar. He has had nonstop problems with the Taxol but has been told this is the last thing they can do for him. The oncologist is leaving it as my hubby's decision when to stop.He has lost the hair on his head, his beard and mustache and is beginning to lose his eyebrows. His face is swollen but not sure if this is from the Taxol or steroids. He is on major painkillers for the cancer pain.  He suffers from feeling overheated to freezing, severe leg pain (which is treated with short term steroid use)swelling of legs from the knees to the toes, so much pain he can't walk most of the time, pain throughout his entire body, and just feeling like his body is shutting down and dying. At this time he has just had his 4th treatment and the cancerous tumors are still growing.  The oncologist said sometimes it can take 5-6 treatments before the Taxol works.While the side effects may be horrible my husband is willing to try whatever is necessary to try to stay alive for as long as possible. He hates the treatments but knows he has to try. All cancer patients on this chemo you have our sympathies but never give up the fight! May God bless you all! ",1
"I am taking taxol/carbo for stage 4 lung cancer. My tumors are gone, and I have faith I will remain cancer free. I am 30 and did not experience mouth sores, pain, nausea, vomiting... just slight chemobrain at the beginning and some slight numbness in my fingertips & toetips. Not sure if this will have an effect on my ovaries yet.",5
It caused very painfull muscle pain in my legs. Was taken of of it but after a years time still have muscle pain in my legs. ,1
"I'm on my 8th treatment of Taxol, and it makes my bones ache to the point to where I have to go to Pain Management. My hair is falling out also. It keeps me down about four days out of the week. I take it via a port in my chest, I go once a week,and I only have four more treatments to go.",4
"I have invasive Ductal Breast Cancer in my left breast.  A 6cm tumor.  The cancer has not spread to other parts of my body.  I just had my 2nd round of Taxol.  My first round, they gave me Dexamethasone and Benadryl to combat to allergic reactions to the Taxol.  I reacted immediately to the Taxol within 1 minute.  I had a sudden flame/torch hot feeling in my head and neck and then my throat started to close up.  They gave me another super dose of Benadryl and the symptoms subsided immeditately.  My hair started to fall out the day before my next treatment.  I was quite a bit of hair and started it seems almost overnight.  My second treatment was yesterday.  I took 20mg of Dexamethasone pm before treatment and another 20mg the am of treatment.  They gave me Benadryl again but we waited 30 minutes for the Benadryl to kick in before starting the Taxol.  Seemed to work, but I started having labored breathing and a weird itch/tingle in my throat about 30 minutes into the treatment.  They stopped the treatment and my doctor prescribed 10mg more of Dexamethasone and more Benadryl.  Restarted the Taxol and I didn't have any further reactions.  Doctor said that once the Taxol is in your system, you will build up a tolerace for it.  So my hopes are that when I go back in 2 weeks, there will not be any reactions at all.",4
"I've only had one treatment so far. Due to have 11 more. Just finished Adriamycin/Cytoxan, which was brutal. On Taxol, I had commented that this is the first time I have felt ""Normal"" in 4 months. Went for my 2nd treatment today and it was cancelled because of elevated liver enzymes. Otherwise, this has been a very well tolerated treatment for me. I'll stop back with more comments halfway through. I hope I'm still feeling as well after my 6th treatment as I do now.",5
I just finished chemo treatment. I found this drug so difficult to tollerate. I have been off the chemo for a month and my hands and feet remain numb and burn. Also my legs hurt terrible. It was a bad experience. I do not see how anyone could take this and work. Good luck to all who take this drug.  ,4
"I have had no problems with this medication, my white cell count has been low but otherwise I have had a good excperience",4
Had this drug after surgery in combination with carbo.  Had a good knockdown of residual nodules and CA125 numbers.  Went to Doxil and Topetecan with dismal results so am back on Taxil alone.  After first dose experienced sleeplessness.  Hope further treatments with this will not cause the same effect.  ,4
because of the use of this drug my husband die too soon.this drug should not be use for  badder cancer.he had two years to lived but this drug shortly his life.,5
"Common side effects such as excessive tiredness, tingling in toes and fingers, achy joints, severe headache, fatigue.",4
No specific diagnosis but suspected lung cancer that has metasticized to colon. Experiencing severe breathing problems still after 2 1/2 weeks. Oncologist denies any possibility of a relationship to taxol; pulmonologist says delayed reactions have been documented.,1
Allof my joints and muscles became inflamed.,1
"Initially during chemotherapy the Taxol caused so much bone pain that I could barely walk and did indeed crawl for weeks.  I also developed numbness in the fingers and toes. Later on I developed pain in the joints - particularly the toes, ankles and wrists. Now 4 years later I continue to have severe pain in the ankles and wrists.  If I over work or exercise the serverity of the pain increases.  I have cramps in the arches of my feet and sometimes my hands and fingers.  I wonder if I am getting better or worse. I stopped taking Tamoxifen because I was unsure if the pain was a long term side effect of the Taxol or increasing because of the Tamoxifen. I have been off of the Tamoxifen for 6 months now and the pain has settled in at a non-changing degree which is still pretty high. The taxol caused me so much pain during chemotherapy I would have accepted amputations - no questions asked. Yep it was that painful. Praise and thanks to God that the pain became bearable after the treatments ended. Now if the cramps will just go away I might be able to tolerate the ongoing pain.  This month I am a 4 year survivor.  ",5
"I used this for breast ca. that had reoccurred after only 12 months. It made me horribly ill, anorexic, nausea, severe fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, severe Chemo Brain. No one told me about the last 2. Its been 2 years and I still suffer nightly with the peripheral neuropathy, and do still have some cognitive difficulties, including making simple decisions. I also could not work for over a year and unable to get any disability because this is not a recognised disability, (the chemo brain that is).If I had been warned I could have made a more informed decision and the answer probly would have been ""find another medication""",3
"I've been treated with Taxol/Carboplatin two times.  The first was frontline therapy after surgery when I was diagnosed with Stage IIIc ovarian cancer.  I went into complete remission which lasted almost 2 years.  When I recurred with a small tumor on the colon, I had another surgery and again received Taxol/Carbo and went into remission.  However this time the remission only lasted 3 months.  The side effects were nasty.  I did not have nausea, thanks to Ondansetron, but I had bad flu-like aching in my joints that lasted anywhere from 2 to 6 days after each treatment (which were once every three weeks).  And of course hair loss.  It was worth it though, to have that time in remission.  I've had two other types of chemo since then and neither has put me back in remission.",4

"I was given 3 treatments of Taxol and another cancer drug for Ovarian cancer.  After 3 treatments and 3 trips to the Emergency Room later that day/night and being admitted each time for severe pain in both legs starting above the knee to my toes. I was sent home with bags full of pain medications that ended up knocking me totally out, I said no more and went saw a different oncologist who referred me to a pain specialist and finished my treatment with a different medication.  I have been cancer free for quite awhile now but as a result of the Taxol I have to take a drug called Methadone for the pain so I can at least function enough to go to work part-time.  This pain will be with me for the rest of my life, I am now 57 years old, and do not know how much longer I will be able to work because the pain is getting worse and if I increase my medication I can no longer work.",1

I've had every available treatment since and now doing round 2.  So far, side effects are minimal this time - a little fatigue, beginning hair loss.  Four doses to go.  I expect issues with my nails, leg swelling, nausea as experienced first time.  This time I'm more active - daily walks, yard work, still riding my motorcycle.  I expect staying busy to help curb some side effects.  Positive attitude helps, too.",4
"Diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  Lost all my hair almost immediately, and am now (even 3 months after chemotherapy finished) losing my nails. Taxotere caused my nail beds to turn black and as that portion grows off, my nails are coming off.  Hair is slow to grow back and is coming back in different texture.  Overall, I tolerated this drug really well.  NO unexpected side effects.",5
I've only had 2 out of 6 infusions. Too early to tell if its effective. Will update after next PSA test. My tolerance is very good. The only negatives were an early swelling of hands (now OK) and fatigue. Bo th side affects have improved.,3

2003 is when I was treated with this drug. I had an allergic reaction in which my feet burned like I walked on hot coals. I could not walk and soon layers and layers of the skin peeled off and lost toenails and finger nails and all the skin on my hands. Ever since I have had severe nerve damage. I do not have active cancer however. They did switch me to Taxol to finish my treatments.,1
"I took Taxotere 20mgs once every 3 weeks as part of my chemotherapy for Stage 2 HER-2 positive invasive ductal carsinoma (breast cancer). During my second infusion I had a terrible reaction. A sharp pain ran from the nape of my neck down my spine and out to all my limbs. I was paralyzed by the pain and called out for help. Oncology nurses ran over and said that I had a reaction to the Taxotere and that my infusion rate needed to be slowed down etc. I was able to take Taxotere for the duration of my 5 chemo cycles but the infusions lasted 6 hours each visit. I was told that my name was added to ""a list"" but was not given any further information. In the months and now 2 years  that followed, I suffered from mild neuropathy in my feet and hands but what was worse was this gnawing pain in my back that has progressively gotten worse. I wasn't even able to take a shower because the water hurt my back as it came out of the shower head. I began to ask my oncologist what this pain was and he seemed baffled and didn't make any connection to the Taxotere incident whatsoever. Each time I mentioned it, he refuted that it was safe and not related. I had numerous MRIs and a PET scan, a full spinal x-ray series, CT scans and even a thorasic spinal epidural to try and relieve the pain and find the root of my pain. All came back that I was fine. With no further answers and help from my oncology team, I decided to seek help from other specialsist. I am now being seen by a Pain Management doctor who is treating my pain as nerve damage from the Taxotere. I am on heavy doses of pain meds and have drastically altered my quality of life. The pain is more manageable than it had been earlier, but it is ever present and masked by medication. I was NEVER informed that chronic nerve damage in my back could be a possible side effect. I have since connected online with others who have suffered with severe pain following Taxotere usage. I am cancer free, but in pain!",4
diahrriea nauseam chronic muscle and joint pain,5
I was given three treatments of taxotere and experienced shortness of breath to point where I have suffered an adverse event causing permanent lung damage.  I have just over 50% of my lung function left.  If you experience shortness of breath to point that you cannot do the things you normally do - insist on getting your lungs examined (via xray or ct scan).  Be sure that you are okay.  Do not take No for an answer.,3

Hands and feet quite numb, nails falling off, excessive fluid retention legs, stomach; difficulty breathing, watery eyes, again no taste, completely rung out so off again now for at least a month - maybe permanently.

I previously had peripheral nueropathy of hands and feet from my first round of chemotherapy so I do not know if taxotere has had any effect on this problem.",3
"Had 7 treatments with Taxotere-no one told me I could permanently lose my hair, but two years after finishing chemo, I have very sparse very thin hair on my scalp, and no body hair, no eyebrows or lashes.I just wish I had been given a choice.There is a sizeable contingent of women around the world who have had the same experience with hair loss and taxotere.Drug company denies it and says it is rare, but there are too many of us for it to be an anomaly. Be forewarned-you could lose your hair permanently and add the insult of alopecia to the injury of breast cancer. So far my cancer remains in remission (they don't say cured, they say remission), but I still continue to fight neuropathy, fatique, low blood counts and chemo brain. And again, it has been 2 years! I am grateful to be alive but if I had been given a choice of something that would not cause all these problems and still kill off the cancer cells, I would have certainly chosen something else. ",4

Then I went back for my 6th and last treatment and after approximately 1/3 of the bag had run in I got hives again.  They gave me Benadryl IV and I got over it but it was certainly scary at the time. Best advice I can give you which I didn't do.... because I was scared to pieces is ask questions, ask about side effects, ask about everything.  I found out that the other drug they gave me can cause heart problems so ask questions!!!! and keep asking until you get an answer you can understand.",1

Side effects were bad...hugh increase of hearing, sense of taste is diminished, neuropathy in legs and arms, sharp pains in joints and chest.  Oncologist says these SHOULD diminish within 12-18 months.  Says that vitamin B-6 and B-12 will help.  Aslo, vitamin D (1000mg dose) and 'statin' drugs have awesome anti-cancer properties as well.  Both my surgeon and oncologist said I came through radiation and surgery exceptionally well and I have 30-40% chance of recurrance BUT that also means I have 60-70% chance it (cancer) does NOT return...I am holding on to those odds!",4
"I have breast cancer that spread to my liver, so I then started Taxotere - after 6 treatments I had a PET scan and no sign of cancer so continued with additional 2 doses (8 treatments in all).  In remission for 2 1/2 months and tumor markers started going up, I had another PET scan that showed tumors had teturned.  Started 2nd round of Taxotere.  After 6 treatments I had  another PET scan that showed the  treatments were no longer working.  I didn't have any major side effects with this drug...the first 5 days after a treatment I just felt kind of yuky and I was tired.  I did not have any problem with vomiting or the other side affects mentioned. Today, (08-26-09) I will start a new chemo drug, Xeloda, taken in pill form.",3
Left with extreme metallic taste that was almost constant. Reduced appetite. Frequent UTI,4
"after beinging on taxotere for 5 month, i received my treatment yesterday and today i have diarrhea which is black and looks like coffee grounds. shoulf i be concerned and seek help for this problem?",5
"My first chemo, the week after, extreme weakness & fatigue, uncontrollable shaking due to sudden allover chills, feel ok one day then down for the next two...hoping the course of treatment doesn't worsen ",3

"Although very effective, I have had horrible side effects with this drug. My fingernails have started to come off, severe swelling of hands and feet, swollen watery eyes, flu like symptoms, dry mouth. Seems like I get a new side effect every few days. It's working but its been very hard to get through. I am very strong and refuse to give in to many ailments but this kicked my butt!",5
"I was involved with the clinical trials for stage 3 breast cancer 12 years ago.  I had wonderful response to the drug (94% shrinkage in my tumor)and relatively few side effects.  I truly believe that I am alive today because of this drug. It was used a second time when I had the disease in the other breast.(Insurance company said it was not ""medically warranted"" to prophalatically remove the other breast when I had my first diagnosis).  I was only able to tolerate 3 cycles due to reactions to the drug.  But again, remarkable response the the drug.",5
"LOW DOSAGE AS PART OF GTX PROTOCOL...HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING MY INOPERABLE STAGE IV PANCREATIC CANCER.  METS IN LIVER AND LYMPHNODES CAN NOT BE IDENTIFIED WITH CONFIDENCE, NOR THE PRIMARY TUMOR IN THE HEAD OF THE PANCREAS.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'M HAPPY! JUST HAD MY 22ND TREATMENT.",5

In 2005 I was treated for breast cancer I received 4 tx.'s of adriamyacin and was to receive 4 tx.'s of taxotere but tx.#1 caused hand & foot syndrome severly lost all my nails on my hands and feet. Also  nerve damage in hands and legs from knees down. Since then it seems to be getting progressly worse. I have been on neurontin 400 mg.'s 3x's daily. If there is any other treatment out there I would greatly appreciate the info.           ,1
This Drug Almost Killed Me.,1
horrible neuropathy starting 2 months after tx,1
I have been on this treatment for 21 Treatments with no noticeable side effects. Has worked very well for me.,5
"I was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma about 18 months ago. I had 6 weeks of radiation, then started on Temodar. I take 300 mg for 5 days every 4 weeks. I have one cycle to go. My last 2 MRIs have been clear. So far I would say this medication is working very well. As long as I take my anti-nausea medication about 30 minutes before the Temodar, but the brand one is really very expensive. I must change to online generic one from bonhoa.com, a famous generic online drug store. It works as the same as brand one. Now I am fine. I take it at night right before I go to bed. God bless all of you.",4
"Combined with radiotherapy so not 100% certain how much the drug contributed to fatigue, but gut disruption was not pleasant. ",4
"Diagonosed 11/2001. Unresectable neuroendocrine tumor. 7 years on Sandostatin, 5 years on Afinitor. Temodar 9 months so far. I feel very blessed to have benefited from all of my treatments. Temodar has been by far the easiest treatment to take. 300 mg per day 5 days per month. Biggest side effect is severe constipation and fatigue. First two series of MRIs showed shrinkage and no spread. Will be doing my 3rd next week.   ",5
"i have taken temodar in conjunction with capecitabine for pancreatic cancer.  the capecitabine has made me severely nauseaus and once i added the temodar, i was really in trouble.  i was unable to eat or drink, (even water) for days, despite trying the anti-nausea drugs zofran, compazine, reglan and ativan.  my advice to you is to go to your oncology clinic and get rehydrated with an iv.  dehydration makes the nausea worse, and you will never get ahead of it if you don't get some iv fluids.    the last time i went, i was given 4 mg of the steroid decadron which eases nausea, encouranges appetite and gives a feeling of well being.      for me, it worked like a charm!  don't suffer it you don't have to !  if you have gone two days without food and if you are drinking only the bare minimum, you WILL be dehydrated.  you can live for weeks without food but you can die within days if your need fluids !  i hope this helps someone.      i don't know if these drugs are working for me as this is the first course. keep your chins up !!!!!!!!!",3
"My husband had surgery in August 2013 and had 90% of the tumor removed. Because of other unrelated medical issues, he didn't start the treatment until 6 weeks after surgery. He had 37 radiation treatments, 5 days/week and during that same period he took 160 mg of temodar 7 days/week. Towards the end of the treatment he became more and more confused, disoriented, restless, anxious and has insomnia. He also hallucinates. Because of these symptoms, they have delayed the second round of Temodar, which will be a 5 day regimen per month.  He has, at this moment, no quality of life. We cannot leave him alone at all because he panics and can't take care of any of his needs, such as dressing, showering, etc. Our family is awaiting an MRI on Jan 2nd to determine whether or not to continue treatment.  At this point quality of life is our utmost concern.  We want to give him every chance to extend his life, but at what cost? He is just existing right now.",1
"Diagnosed with GBM grade 4 in 1/13, had immediate surgery with full excision of tumor. Completed 6 weeks of radiation concurrent with 42 days straight of temodar. Now on monthly cycles as described by others in this post, taking the highest dose for my height and weight. So far, so good. MRIs show no recurrent tumor, only side effects have been fatigue and constipation. I will gladly put up with these as long as this continues to work. So very grateful to have this drug. God Bless all of my fellow GBM colleagues! Keep fighting, we can do it!!!",4
"i was diagnosed sept 2011 with stage 4 glioblastoma and they treated me immediately with radiation and chemo. i was told 4-12 months for my survival rate.  however, the tumour has just reappeared so now back on the treatments again. hopefully it will give me another couple of years.",4
"Tumor found last weekend of January 2013, operated he following Tuesday, 7cm x 5cm x 3.5cm. Pathology determined it was GBM4. Have completed Phase I after surgery, 42 days on,with radiation for 34 days at the same time. Lost about 2/3rds of my hair in beaming areas of scalp. Had 1 month off. Am now on Phase II, 5 days on 23 days off, every month. No real problems experienced other than occasional passing nausea and tiredness. Zofram has handled any stomach upset taken 1 hour before the temodar. MRIs and CTs so far good. CBCs good except for a .1 variation in liver enzymes, within norms. Have returned to work. Things so far are good.",4
"Diagnosed with GBM4 on 12/15/2008 surgery on 1/13/2009 to remove 7.5cm tumor.I also had 6 gliodel wafers at time of surgery.

Last 3 MRI's have came back with no sign of the cancer!!Biggest problem is fatigue, I consider myself at about 95%. I can do most everything I did before surgery, now I just take more short naps.",5
"I've had no problems with this drug, although I thought the benefit would last longer than 1 year.  I have new growth after finishing 1 year of Temodar and being off 1 year.  I'm back on the Temodar doing a 21 day on, 7 off.  My first round was 5 days on and 23 off.  I hope it works again!",4
"I was prescribed temodar when I was 12 after my brain tumor (which I got when I was 6) came back. I did 1 year and it was horrible for me. It didnt shrink the tumor but it stopped it from growing. I was always vomitting and nausea medicine didnt work. After my year my tumor started growing again. I was put on temodar again this time with lower doses for 18 months. It has been 6 years and my tumor is still stable (last use: 2006). I guess I'm satisfied, would of been great though if it got rid of my tumor. ",4

I have not had any lost work for norisa, do have the fatuigue in week one and week two of cycle. Have been able to work full time since six weeks after surgery exam.",5
"I have just started treatment, 5 days once a month. 2 weeks off so far. I completed a series of radiation first. Extreme fatigue a lot of non listed symptoms. My hair is increaded in loss from when it did from radiation. Has anyone experienced hair loss from Temodar? I was told it would not happen.",3
"Diagnosis on 12/24/09 with surgery on 1/4/10.  6 weeks of radiation with 180 mg of Temador.  Continued Temador for another 8 months.  MRI every two months.  From the beginning I saw a naturalpath that specialized in Glioblastomas. Took ~100 supplements a day, down to 50 now.  Recurrence in 10/11 as expected.  I was told that there is an expectation that 90% will have a recurrence within two years.  I am unable to work due to the memory issues.  A 15 min nap at lunch solved the tiredness issue.  I feel great and am living an otherwise normal life.  ",4
"About 80% of my tumor was removed surgically, however it started growing back 3 months later.  My doctor opted for Temodar.  So far, my ""aggressive"" tumor has not grown anymore.  The only side effect I have experienced is a little fatigue after the 5 day cycles each month.  I have been on Temodar for a year and my doctor checks my blood count each month and it has been great.  He is taking me off of the treatment to see what happens but is still going to monitor me closely every three months.",5
"They found my brothers gbm4 in 2007 he had surgery, with a 80% reduction ,temodar,radiation,for 6 months .he has been in remission for four years now and just last month the tumor started to grow again,he is good health so we are givin it a try again,here's to 4 more years. the combination of all three has giving us a priceless gift?",5
"In June of 2011, my Dad was diagnosed with Stage iv glioblastoma.  Treatment? - Temodar.  Other than he lost a lot of weight and yet bloated up, no real side effects UNTIL August 23rd, 2011.  He was admitted to the hospital because he was having difficulty breathing.Very short yet long story made short, the following Monday, he died.  This ""miracle"" drug which was supposed to give us at least another year on the 6 months he would have had without it, KILLED him in two months.  It cost them $5,000.00 for this medication - and it killed him. Make sure you read EVERYTHING before taking this drug.  MY Dad was 80.  Apparently they had not really tested it on over 70.  You might say, ""he lived a long life"", but he had so much more to do and live.  His parents lived 10 years beyond his life.  Just think about it, 10 years is a long time.  ",1
"Brain melanoma, taken temodar 4per day for 5 days,off for 23 days. Fatigued after taken was only side effect while using it. Taken ffor about 2 yrs and it no longer was effective for me. Now I find myself having pain in my stomach, on right side by ribs and back area, disorientated at times, unbalanced,insommnia,hungry all the time, feel very very weak..Dr. started me on Decradron for swelling in brain area because of Radiation Necrosis of the tissue surrounding brain tumor that Radiation reduced to 1/2 in size, then Dr, said tumor was not there but Necrosis was, so tit for tot, change one for the other??? I do feel the Temodar was beneficial for me with very little side effects( not unless Temodar side effects are associated with what I have now but just took time to show up)..",3
I am on a 23/5 cyle. I'm starting my 18th cycle today.  I had two small metasticized tumore in my brain when I began taking the chemotherapy. The tumors had disappeared by the 3rd cycle.,5

He hasn't taken the drug in about 6 months.  He is now experience severe and almost constant stomach pain... I'm just wondering if this has anything to do with the drug because none of his doctors can figure out why he is having this pain. ",4

This is my second trip on temodar I have been on 100mg every day for the last 18 months fatigue can get bad they put me on adderall for fatigue have been off steroids for1 year which has caused most of my side effects my tumor is brain stem which means they can't do surgery.haven't seen much  change on MRI but brain tumor symptoms are better. I was diagnosed in 1989 before chemotherapy was available for braintumors.  I had 6 wkd of radiation,5
"Been on Temodar for the past 10 months for treatment of anaplastic ependymoma.  Began 7 days on, 7 off of 220 mg after radiation did not work.  220 reduced to 120 after having problems with low platelets. Last MRI said tumor is no longer visible!  Staying on another few months for safety.  Side effects: awful fatigue! with no apparent pattern, some days good followed by some miserable days where I sleep all day. Also, constipation, loss of appetite, bruising, possible slight memory loss(?), slight changes in math and language ability (could be surgery/radiation remnants).  All bearable if it makes my tumor go away :-)",4
"I was given 6 months with tumors all over my body. That was in January. My cancer is gone now, after 3 treatments of this drug. So far, so good. I will live to see my daughters wedding day. ",5
My husband has taken Temodar for 6 months (5days per month) and his major side effect if a rash that develops 1 - 3 days after he stops taking it.  I am also noticing significant fatigue and some impairment in his ability to follow complex directions or plotlines.  His brain tumor has continued to shrink as evidenced by MRIs taken every 3 months. What are the longterm effects?,5
"Surgery 10/09 (tumor removed), then 34 radiation + 140mg temodar treatments, 30 day rest period, then began clinical trial of 220mg temodar, 7 days a week, every other week, plus 800mg of Celebrex every day. Chemo week began as not too bad, non-chemo week was great but not I do get tired if I don't control my activities. I am on my 6th month of temodar and so far no signs of another tumor. I don't know if it is too soon to rate temodar but I have nothing bad to say about it.  ",5

My husband has been on this for 5 mos. with 1 treatment to go. Dr. cannot find research studies to prove it lasts any longer. So far tumor has shrunk. Only side effect is tiredness during 5-day period. Takes with anti-nausea pill. ,5
"This drug is killing my mother.  She took it for 20 or so days with no side effects.  Then we noticed significant bruising.  Blood test showed dangerously low platelets and almost no white blood cells.  She has been hospitalized for 19 days now with pneumonia and is on her death bed.  The tumor is not killing her, the chemo is.",1
"Tumor was non-responsive to treatment after 6 weeks of daily dosage followed by 2 months of monthly follow-up dosing. This was combined with 6 weeks of radiation following surgery. After the second month of follow-up dosing, tumor was found to be re-growing.",1

The first 2-3 of 5 days go pretty well; after that, fatigue, constipation, loss of appetite increase, but so far, not too bad. Nausea has so far been controlled by zofran.

Have had good experience so far on Temodar (295mg). I had 2 tumors removed and decided against radiation and taking only the oral chemo. Scans have been good so drug is working. Not to many side effects other than lack of concentration and horrable constipation.,4
"My husband is 52.  Has been on 340 mg Temodar since February 2008, taken 5 days on  and 23 off immediately before going to bed w/Anzemet  to avoid nauseated feeling.  Very fatigued but keeping the tumor away.  Short term memory is affected but can't say it is from the drug and not the surgery itself.",4
"Second iteration of Temodar (2009), last used in 2003. Expect similar effectiveness and more rounds in subsequent years. Every 5-6 years is hardly something to complain about.  In terms of ease of use, can't beat it (oral at night vs. IV/portacath) and the side effects have been limited in comparison to previous IV-introduced therapy.  I'm satisfied with the drug. If you prefer more agressive therapy, read cancer research articles for something to augment Temodar. In my case, I'm taking EGCG tablets; a study at USC suggests EGCG increases chemosensitivity to Temodar. (survival:13 years, 3 months)",5
"My father is 46 and was on this for 42 days with radiation and then once this was done he did 5 days of 300 mg once a month. This was done for 3 months until the tumor had begun to grow again.

"I am on 42 day treatment paired with radiation.  until recently no side effects, now experiencing smothering effect anywhere from 2 to 7 hrs. after taking.  cannot lay on back and breath during this time.  eventually it subsides and I can go to bed.

Please could some one out there tell me these are from the chemo drug?

began treatment 2 weeks ago so far no side effects,5
"I am in my 21th month of temodar out of 24. I've been really tired and experienced bad side effects during 3 of the 5 days of treatment on average.  I'm disappointed because my tumors (two locations) were inoperable and have barely shrunk. But the stabilization is perfect. I would hate having to take this drug for the rest of my life as the symptoms caused by the tumors have not disappeared (seizures, vertigo, dizziness and distorted apprehension of space). What's the use of two years of fatigue in your life for this????",3
"I've taken my first week's dosage (300 mg per day) and have felt o.k., except for fatigue.  I've completed the radiation and Temodar 40 day treatments, now on the monthly dose.  So far so good.  Wish I had more energy, and I sleep a lot.  ",5

I recently finished 18th cycle and Oncologist reports it is keeping my condition stable. As MRI scans may remain stable, I am physically feeling more run down as the effects are cumulative.

Left kidney and surrounding tissues including left adrenal gland and lymph nodes and a tumor around the vena cava where removed 5/29/13. He was to start treatment with Torisel on July 8th. Sarcomatoid tumor came back in his right shin, 7/5/13 right leg was removed above the knee, treatment was delayed in order for amputation to heal and to get a prostetic leg fitted. Torisel finally started in the 2nd week of September. We've had some problems with skin rash and mouth sores, but these responded well, biggest problem was pnuemanitis at week 12, had to skip a week. Torisel shrank the 3 small nodules in my husbands left lung. Slowed the growth of a tumor on the right adrenal gland and liver, at this time we decided to surgically remove these tumors, also removed a suspisious lymph node in his right groin. At this time 1/21/14 there is no detectable cancer in my husbands body. We are to restart treatment on 2/5/14, there has been some question as to possibly change his treatment, but after reading other comments I feel we should stick with the Torisel.",4
Extensive skin lesions and pruritis,4
"today was my wife's 14th treatment of torisel, and we are scheduled for our second ct/scan while on this drug. The first scan was promising after taking both sutent and nexavar with little positive results. Since she has been on torisel there have been Fatigue after each dose and a blood transfusing because of the effect of torisel reducing blood counts. Thankfully no mouth soars so far",3
"My husband has received weekly 25mg IV Torisel beginning Jan 18, 2010 for his mRCC. The one obvious tumor in his neck has decreased by 1/2 the original size.  Main side effects: bitter taste, no appetite, moderate itching and rash (Sinequan given), elevated blood sugar, cholesteral, triglycerides, anemia. Today he was given an injection for the anemia. Does anyone know what it may have been? It was not Procrit. History: kidney removed 2000; part of 2nd kidney removed 2002; Thyroidectomy/mRCC 2009; Sutent 50mg/20 days 2009, bad side effects.        ",3
"My husband (now 58) was diagnoised with advanced renal cell carcinoma in sept 2003. He has had a kidney and adrenal gland removed. He was initially put on Nexavar and was on it for a little more than 2 years (lots of side effects).  He has now been on weekly infusions of Torisel for 13 months. During this period he has developed mets in his liver, spine, and ribs. He had some daily radation on the spinal mets in addition to the torisel with amazing results. The mets in his rib and liver however continue to increase in size.  His oncologist is optimistic though and wants to continue with the Torisel if possible. The major side effect he has experienced is swelling of his get/ankles.  Keep believing this disease can be cured, there are new treatments developed annually.  ",4
"I had my left Kidney removed last July (2008) and it was rated stage III/IV. Went on Sutent and could barely handle the side effects. A CT scan in January 09 showed RCC in the lymph nodes. A July CT scan showed the Sutent had stopped working and the spots were growing. Sutent was stopped.  I started on Torisel on Sept 11th, 09. After 4 treatments, the rash/acne was so bad, (face, scalp, chest, and mouth/tongue)the fifth week was canceled to give me time to recover.   Started 6th week at a slightly reduced dose and the acne came back but not in my mouth.  The CT scan on October 16th showed a reduction in the lymph nodes.  I have had 7 treatments so far, and I am on antibiotics to control the acne. ",4
"Have had 7 t6reatments.  First CT taken within days.  Have chromophobe kidney cancer, mets to bones.  Sutent side effects too difficult.  Dropped that dose and eventually stopped working. Switched to Torisel. Bad skin rashes are only significant side effect;  rest can be tolerated.  God bless all and good luck.",4
I have now received 37 treatments.  I haven't had any bad reactions but the taste change.  Everything tastes bad!  My cancer is still growing but slowly.  I have renal cell carcinoma in 5 spots.  I just finished radiation treatment for quality of life issues.  Now I can walk again.,3
"My fiance has been on Torisel 25 mg's since Jan. 11 2008, he has stage 4 mrcc, altho kidney removed in Nov. mets to both his lungs..He had 3, 25 mg's and then his borderline scans after his 3rd treatment he had 5-10% shrinkage after 3 doses.. He is due for his next catscan in 2-3 weeks and we'll see how those turn out...He has a a few problems with getting a very bad rash, but with a slight mg steriod, has only had to take a week off a month, and with the original bad rash came he had to take 3 weeks off, plus drop to 15 mg, for 2 weeks up to 20mg Monday back up to 25 mg's...I look at all the targeted drugs are hard and i'm not expecting to much shrinkage, but any shrinage is better than nothing or regrowth...So we are both very pleased with Torisel and a very understanding oncologist..It's helped up thru a very difficult time, making decision neither one of us thought we'd ever have to make....Thanks for reading...",4
"I have been taking Torisel weekly for 9 months. Side effects: change in taste, mouth sores, weight loss. Have had two CT scans since taking Torisel. Tumors in lungs, adrenal, & remaining kidney have stopped growing.I took Nexavar and Sutent but side effects were too much, even tho the drugs were effective in shrinking tumors.",4
I have metastatic recal cell carcinoma  Sutent & Nexavar did nothing. Torisel was easy use and significantly reduced my tumors after 8 treatments.  Then it stopped working.  Over the next few months of treatment the tumors in lungs did not change while those in my abdomen & liver increased in size.  ,3
"so far so good, have metatastic renal cell tried nexavar, didnt work now on torisel for 6 months tumors are stable, no growth or new ones, i pray this  keeps working. my worst side effect is being extremely tired after the pre med of benedryl.",4
Ihave had 9 treatments with this drug.  The only side effect that I have noticed is taste change.  My last CT scan showed no change in the size of my cancer.,4
"I HAVE STAGE 4 RENAL CELL. MY KIDNEY WAS REMOVED BUT I HAVE MULTIPLE NODULES  IN THE LUNGS, DUE TO RCC METASTESIZING. I HAVE BEE ON TORISEL FOR 6 WEEKS. HAVE GAINED 10 LBS! DR SAID IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE TORISEL IS WORKING. HAVE A RASH ON BACK, BUT SOMEONE SAID THAT PROBABLY MEANS THE TORISEL IS WORKING. WILL HAVE CT SCAN IN A FEW WEEKS. OVERALL,VERY SATISFIED AND PRAY THIS IS WORKING! DONALD",4
"Three years I had one kidney removed because of malignancy.  Period CT scans afterward were clear; however, recently a new tumor was discovered, metastasized renal cell carcinoma.  Started on Sutent but it had a dangerous effect on heart function.  Switched to Torisel and have been on it 3 months now.  Tumor has not grown and the active area has reduced slightly.  Side effects are not a problem considering the probable outcome if I wasn't taking it.",5
I have been taking Torisel for two months with minimal side effects. My CT scan showed my tumors had not grown.,4
"My dad just started this treatment. He has stage 4 renal cell carcinoma and has had one hell of a year. This is the third treatment, after Nexavar and Sutent. He has just had one treatment so far and is due his next one Friday, so I will post again when I know more about it.",1
After 4 treatments (total of 6 required) I have had diarrhea anyone else experience this?   I am on Treanda and rituxan ,4
"My dad was diagnosed with MCL 7.5 years ago and was on Trenda. Of the three MCL drugs over his 7.5 years the Treanda was the most effective. Dad passed away after 8 years battling MCL.His last drug was Imbruvica and was unfortunately ineffective. He was the first person in the state of Iowa to try Imbruvica. Many advances has taken place since the first of his diagnosis. Our family is proud that dad tried two experimental trial drugs. Treanda was his first trial drug and today it is on the market due to people like my dad, Duane Duit.",5
"This medication is working ok, but, i am having a very big side effect problem with upper and lower GI issues, such as, severe GERD and Bowel issues while taking this med. ",4
first treatment greatly reduced dangerous lymph node in neck   after fourth treatment began experiencing diffuse skin rash starting on legs and expanding to torso and arms; rash and itching somewhat controlled by steroid cream and benedryl; worried about 5th and 6th treatments and expanding rash,4
"I have CLL my white count was 255,platelets were low and I did one round,It did bring my white count and lymph nodes down, but my numbers still weren't were they needed to be.I got a serious infection and couldn't continue untill the infection was gone,after the infection was gone three months later I did three rounds and my numbers are now great.It's been 17 months and I'm still doing good.I have lymph nodes that are coming back so I''m excited to take it again.I was very pleased with the results because my numbers were so bad.I was given medicIne for nausea, and was alittle tired but this past year I have my energy back.i prefer this chemo over others I've had because I have had the past year and a half to do things I couldn't do before.By the third round I was feeling bad but I 'm glad I stuck it out, well worth it.I also use alternative things with this and feel it helped after chemo.",4
"Platelets r my problem. After treatment 2, platelets are up to 52 from 10, and WBC are down to 5 from 13.  I have experienced burning in my arm during IV and this week arm has stayed sore to touch. Hopeful. ",4
dr. called me today after PET scan. i'm at week 14 of an 18 week schedule. non-hodgkins lymphoma. combined rituxan with treanda.  large tumor is gone. two older tumors from first round of chemo are down to two specks. have two more chemos to go.  hope this report is encouraging.,5
"Started my treatment of cll with  treanda and Rituxan. My wbc count was 383. after four rounds of treanda with rituxan, i'm down to wbc of 5. minimal side effects. It's been good!",5
"After 8 years of watchful waiting including about 4 years on Chorambucil, I got put on Treanda.  The % of leukemic cells went from 62-65% down to 17% after only 4 treatments.  Had no side effects, did not lose any hair.  I don't know how long the good news will continue because I only got 4 of the 6 recommended treatments before my insurance (COBRA) ran out, but I feel good and now pay for a port flush and a blood check every 6 weeks.  My white cells count was very low, but hopefully will improve.  Doc said I may not need 6 treatments because 4 did very well.  We will see.",4
"i just started this med,im a 39 yr old male been through chemo n 05 also,its my 3rd day i have felt very very good,better than 05 treatment",3
I experienced lots of fatigue after each of the first two treatments.  I could fall asleep just sitting and I did it all the time.  I did not expect the nadir to begin immediately so it was hard to deal with.  Treatments are every three weeks for two one hour treatments.  Next one is this week.  Ugh.,4
"The first 3 treatments were easy, only a day and a half of nausea and 5-7 days of fatigue.  I needed the neulasta shot after my 4th, counts not recovering as well.  Also after the 4th the fatigue held on for almost 3 weeks.  Still functioned fine, just not as enthusiastically. Still have my hair, and no mouth sores so far, 2 more to go. Before my 3rd treatment we did a scan and no sign of disease, seems to be working.",5
"Have had 3 2 day treatments so far. Low WBC counts-waiting on those to come back up. No real problems with this drug, other than some fatigue. It really helps to drink lots of water-6 to 10 bottles a day. I call it Chemo-light.",4
"My husband was Dx in Jan 2004 with MCL. Since that time he has been give many different treatments. The Treadra was started in July  since aggressive tumors (12 CM in Chest) returned. He has recieved 3 cycles with Rituxin as the 1st day followed by 2 days of Treanda  with a follow up Neulasta shot. He has extreme fatique, poor appetite, and weight loss. The upside is his Petscan 2 weeks ago  (after 2 cycles) shows tumors shrinking drastically. He has low platelets (15,000) most of the time and has been given a reduced dosage of Treanda. He will have at least 6 cycles and hopefully knock it completely down to an indolent state. This is the best response we have seen of all drugs he has been give. ",4
Warning- Do not take with allopurinol. Company has reported 1 death from Stephens Johnson syndrome- skin disease.,4
"The biggest side effect I have experienced is extreme fatigue.  The first treatment took about one week to recover; the second treatment has taken almost two weeks.  I will find out next week if I will have a 3rd.  The first Neulasta shot gave me spasms of pain controlled by Tylenol.  The second was insignificant as far as side effects go but kept my counts up.  I have had slight nausea, loss of appetite with the Treanda and hope the scans next week prove it is working.",4
"The only problem as greatly increased urination during nightime, and loss of sleep from this. ",4
"EXTENSIVE MOUTH SORES, DIFFICULTY IN JOINING IN DAILY ACTIVITIES.EATING,SLEEPING, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE",3

"I have had what might be considered as mild psoriasis, and recently it had spread to the fingers and palms of both of my hands.  All of the other topical ointments had been unsuccessful.  I have been on Trexall for 2 mos, and it has virtually cleared up from my palms, and only a few spots are still noticeable on a few of my fingers.  It has made all of the difference in the appearance of my hands, and just being able to shake hands with people again.  Other than dealing with an upset stomach on the day that I take the medication, I haven't noticed any side effects.  After my last visit with my doctor, and because of the cost of the oral drug, I will be trying the injections next month.  ",5
I have been taking methotrexate for about three years and it has helped me tremendously with my rheumatoid arthritis.  It has made a world of difference for me.  Very little or no pain now.  I was in quite bad shape when I started it. I was taking eight 2 1/2 milegrams of it and just about a month ago the doctor suggested that I see if I could get along with only six of the pills per week. I have noticed some pain and swelling in my right hand since I decreased my dosage.  The doctor may put me back on eight pills a week. This medicine has been a godsend for me.,5
"I have used mxt for 2 years. Other than the fear of all the side effects, mxt has worked well for me along with Enbrel. I currently haven't had any side effects. I'm taking (8)2.5 mg once a week. The last two months I've tried to cut down to 6, because I was feeling so well and didn't like the possible side effects. I feel like my pain has increased and my mobility has decreased, so with the Dr's approval will probably work back up to 8.",4
"I've been diagnosed with RA for over 10 years now and have been on and off of methotrexate a couple of times.  Currently, I've been on it for 1.5 years and am having moderate success with it.  However, it does make me tired and nauseated on the day that I take it.  And it hasn't completely made me pain free or fatigue free from the RA.  However, because of other medical conditions it is really my only option.",4
"I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago.  I tried methotrexate without much relief for 8-9 months.  They dosed me with a wide variety of NSAIDs along with it, but none of them helped at all.  A new dr. put me on Arava, with the metho & my liver enzymes went sky high.  They are still not back to normal after nearly a year with no meds at all. I just got scared away from taking anything, but wrist joint damage has begun.  So, I started plaquenil, and I am trying milk thistle and staying away from all alcohol for the time being. We shall see, not much relief so far, just digestive issues, increased hot flashes and mid-afternoon into evening fatigue that wrecks my life.  I have Sjoerens & Reynauds also.  I had wheezing yesterday – haven’t had that since on metho.  But, of course the Drs. say it is not associated.",3
I have been taking methotrexate now for almost a year and see no change in my current psoriasis areas and i have noticed that i am still getting new break outs. ,2

"India generic Tykerb from bonhoa.com really give me new life. I takes tykerb 5 pills daily at one time for 3 weeks and off for 1 week per doctor, satisfied. The generic lapatinib 250mg and Xeloda have stabilized my tumors. My family can not afford the brand one, but generic save my life. God bless all of you.",4
Been on it for 9 weeks along with taxol have pet scan tomorrow,4
"Already on Herceptin , Xeloda , & Letrozole , the Tykerb caused dizziness , increased fatigue , increased 'chemo brain ' , anxiety , and emotional /chemical   depression .I took it for only 1 week , and could feel the hair follicle burn that preceded my hair loss from my first chemo infusion , a Taxane . Tried to go on again , same effects, including diarrhea —— anyone else experienced  these  effects ?",1
"For me this drug has been a life saver. I refused further IV chemo after my first 6 months, due to the inability to remember those 6 months. I also stopped Herceptin due to heart damage. My cancer returned quickly but Tykerb has slowed the growth of those cancer cells that found a home in my rib. I have been on Tykerb for 15 months and pray it works forever. The diarrhea is tough to control and what works for awhile, stops, and we try a new approach. 2014 was my best year ever. My bucket lists is shorter and I got to spend quality time with those I love. Quality of life is so important to me, and I have been able to do the things I love because of this medication. My terrible pain in the rib stopped within 2 weeks of starting Tykerb and has not returned!",5
"I currently care for a 84 yr old female thats been on this drug for about 6 months it's seem's to have helped slow it down. But at the same time other thing are ac-coring like blood cloth'shortness of breath which we thought at the time was pneumonia and turned out from Chest Xray, CT Scan it wasn't that, so just getting to the point pay were close attention to all side effects of this drug the.1. Main Ones, 2.The Rare Ones 3. Infrequent Side Effects. Family members should be aware of all side effect so we can ask the right question plus notice any changes In the body since this involves the entire family and some family member may see things that other may not.  ",5
"After my Herceptin treatments started showing less effectiveness, my Dr. Prescribed Tykerb along with Herceptin.  I take 4 pills daily and have been for 3 months.  Side effects for me a tolerable...some diarreha but Imodium works to stop it.  Also take Phillips Colon Health Probiotic. That is what helped me the most with Diarreha while going through chemo. Dr is monitoring me every 3 weeks. So far...so good. ",5
"I've been on Tykerb for 2 mos now and have the fairly severe and immediate diarrhea.  It is sometimes controlled with imodeum.  I am fearing the acne, but so far don't have this side effect.  I do have some stomach pain at times.  Nothing unbearable yet, thank God.  ",3
I have taken the drug for one year - have had no symtoms - and only one met has increased in size - most are gone. only cancer left in one area of brain - will use cyberknife.,5
"i have had 5 pills every morning(250 mg tablets)for 6 weeks now. it's treating a brain tumor. the only side effects so far are: serious acne, loose bowels, and fatigue. too soon to know if it works.",1
"I took this during a clinical trial comparing Tykerb to Herceptin. I was supposed to take this for a year, but after two weeks I had to stop. I was exhausted to the point I could not get out of bed. My diaherra was so severe that I could not eat at all (not even crackers or popscicles). Finally, after losing 13 pounds in two weeks and becoming so dehydrated that they had to give me two bags of fluids, I was taken off the drug and given Herceptin by IV for the rest of the year. I have one more treatment left. I have been very happy with Herceptin. It has hardly any side effects. I think Tykerb works for some people, but if your side effects are this severe, please make your doctor change your meds! It was worse than the 20 weeks of chemo!",2
"I was a success for me, also easy.",5
"good results, keep tumors stable, but causes itchy skin, acne, and diareha daily.",4
"My Mother takes tykerb 5 pills daily at one time for 3 weeks and off for 1 week per doctor, satisfied, but she has such a terrible itching spell all the time and there is nothing she takes that can get rid of it, I rub lots of creams and have her to take benadryl 2 every four hours and that is not good because she wont be able to do her chores like she wants. ",5
"While I am still on the treatment, my last CT scan showed that the lung lesions were shrinking. However, I have had more nodules forming on my skin on my breast. I haven't had any severe side effects from the medication. Just some fatigue, hand/foot tingling, and some digestive symptoms which might be due the Xeloda (I don't know for sure). The doctor has just started me on Femara. I had my ovaries removed also.",4
"I have had severely painful, frequent(hourly)urination since receiving the drug 9 days ago. There has been no improvement at this point.Urgent urination, basically can not hold myself. ",1
"I had 7 weeks,that is one time a week. The hardest part was holding it in  on the last 2 treatments. It's been a year since I had treatments and no sign of cancer. ",5
I had difficulty holding my bladder after installation. One visit I was on Vicodin for back pain and held it for the full 2 hours. My doc gives me 2 pills for each installation and now does the same for other patients. It works for most of them he told me. Glad I in advertently helped other people. The Vicodin reduces the irritation therefore making it easier to hold the full two hours.,4
I just finished the 6th treatment. Don't know how effective it will be. All treatments were very easy except the last one.I could not hold it for the two hours.,4

Therefore they have trouble eating, drinking and in pain from effects.  It has had an emotional and physical toll on her because of being on her face etc. where it could not be covered and she is not a vain person.  Her dose has been lowered twice.

"Third try at kicking this disease. First was a stem cell transplant that lasted almost 3 years. Round 2 was Oral chemo with Dexamethazone and Lenalidomide, good for another 3 years. The numbers started creeping back up and now were on to the Borteximib with Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethazone. Just finished cycle 5 of 8. 4 weeks of weekly injections and then 1 week off. The oral drugs don't take the week off. Fantastic results right out of the gate after 2 cycles I was in normal light chain range again. The injections are easy to handle, although the area is getting  a little irritated in general. Now that being said, I'm a fairly substantial target at 240 lbs, so they jam a lot of that stuff into me every week. The biggest side effect I'm experiencing is a lack of energy. Also finding over the last week or two that I'm beginning to lose my breath more quickly. Might6 be a bug, but I'm going to talk to the oncologist about it next week. The energy drop has been a steady decline since treatment started and I used to recover within a few days of injection, but it is getting more prolonged and more severe also. I may have to take some time off work in the end, but I'm committed to killing as much of this crap as I can, so going to tough it out as long as possible. The drugs are doing their part now so I'm going to help it out with a good attitude and kick this disease in the ass!",5
"Diagnosed, after the collapse of 2 vertebra L6 & L12 resulted in the lose of 3 in. of height, plus an estimated 75% kidney function loss, in March 2012 with Stage 3 MM.  After three weeks of intensive chemo treatments (Velcade + steroids) in the hospital.  During that time I lost 50 of my previous 170 lbs, I was released when the doctors finale realized the hospitalization was killing me faster then the MM could left untreated.  After release I was put on a bi-weekly treatment regime of bortezomib and panobinostat until Oct.  That's when it was determined I has recovered sufficiently to survive a Stem-cell reinfusion.  Completed during x-mass week 2012 and followed since by bi-weekly chemo of Velcade injections.  The list of side-effects ranging from extensive excessive to no bowel activity.  Swelling of the feet and ankles plus a rash from waist down I would have swore was the result of being attached by Fire Ants.  Seeking any form of relief that may help, I started using the oriental detox foot patches that seemed to change the course of the problem within a few weeks.  Physiological or not ?? and I don't care, something worked to stop the terrible burning and itching that nearly drove me mad plus nearly destroying any hope of sleep, for months.  Now, post resent biopsy (Feb. 2015), we have discovered the Velcade is losing effectiveness as the MM is on the rise again.  New war plan is called for which I will summit with my doctors on this week.  Keep the faith and remember my old fall back position, no one gets out alive.  In the interim, every day's a good day and a new adventure.                      ",4
"I am a Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia patient. It appears that Velcade is the first chemo that has greatly reduced the IgM and serum viscosity numbers. However, I couldn't tolerate the usual dosage (twice a week)and eventually got it once every two weeks. But it still reduced numbers. However, it did give me neuropathy (in feet) and doctor has discontinued use for awhile. Feet are recovering (with Neuronton). Have to see if numbers remain reduced. It did work and I've had worse side effects from other chemo. This wasn't bad.",4
"I ave taken velcade for 2 years since 2011.  It has been very effective and I have had very little side effects.  My numbers are very good since being on velcade. For me, the outcome over weighs the side effects.  I am been fortunate and extremely bless to have little to no pain.  I have never taken pain medications, not even a tylenol.  Praise the Lord.",5

"You have to be satisfied with being in remission, but the neuropathy in my feet really makes me question whether or not I should have gone the transplant route. I just found out the Velcade has damaged the nerves in my stomach where I can’t digest food correctly.  Make sure you are up front and honest with you Doctor about the pain. DO NOT assume the pain is supposed to be that bad.  ",4
SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS LEG PAIN OTHERWISE SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL,5

Ths brought her kidneys back and the light chain numbers down to the 40's but doc recommended diff treatment, said still too high.  Did a trial at Stanford then on o revlimid. Numbers back up to 60's so considering adding velcade  at lower dose and not IV.  Neuropathy so bad with IV she couldn't walk and took over 6mos to get feeling in feet again.  ",3

Side effects have varied, but have been able to control some of them using other medications(most over the counter). The only side effect that has been bothersome has been the pain in my hands and feet, but over the last couple of weeks, using heat in the evening and a change in medications(the addition of a beta-blocker), the pain has lessened and has become livable. ",5
legs and feet drive me crazy,3
"Initially treated with radiation & steroids, been on Velcade for 7 months. Mild nausea initially, some constipation, worst side effect for me has been lethargy. My numbers are in normal ranges, being transplanted next month. Had no neuropathy, no hair loss, mild appetite suppression but no weight loss. Can ""taste"" smell of medication days after treatment... but I can tolerate that. Experiencing ""dry"" eyes, facial hair, and acne, but doctor says that they most likely from steroids. I am very pleased with my results & treatment.",5
mantle cell progressed rapidly worse after 3 months on velcade.,1
"After being on Revlimid, it was determined that Velcade would do a better job in getting my numbers down to a proper level for a stem cell transplant (autologous). Within 2 cycles I was ready. I had the transplant and within 4 months I was classified as CR (complete response). It will be 2 years in May 2010 and my numbers are still good. The only side effect of the medication is peripheral neuropathy. Although pretty bothersome, it is better than the alternative. I am aware that there is no cure for MM but thankfully there are drugs out there to help us survive. ",5
I have had MM for five years with no symptoms other than a bloodclot. Velcade has knocked my protein levels down to normal with 6 treatments.Excruciating neuopathy in legs discontinued treatment. I am taking Lyrica which knocked out the neuropathy completely.,5
"I was scheduled to have eight rounds of four injections each.  After only four rounds, I was in remission!  However, I did develop neuropothy in my feet, experienced vomiting and diarrhea, chills and weakness.  It was not easy, but I would do it again, as I have been in remission for six years.",5
"62 year old male,drug worked well with the cancer, but pain & swelling in feet & legs put me somewhat disabled.",4
"I began chemotherapy soon afterwards but I don't think with Velcade.  I went to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the summer of 2008 to have extensive chemo in preparation for a stem cell transplant which she had soon afterward.  When I returned to Florida, where we live, in early September 2008 my oncologist put me on Velcade.  So far, so good.  Even though I have side effects such as nausea and fatigue I seem to handle my treatments OK. Some of the best places for treatment for are in Florida, they are the Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, the Mayo Clinic also in Florida and of course, Sloan-Kettering in New York.   ",5

Side effect of constipation and loss of appetite.  ,5
the injection is relatively painless and I have had little if any side effects aside from thirst and hunger,3
"It is early in my treatments, Still not sure of all side effets. Got sick with flu like symptoms once. And definitely have lack of appetite.  W.",5
"The velcade has worked well to respond to the blood disorder, but the side effects are becoming increasingly hard to handle.  The pain from neuropothy in the feet, ankles and legs is excruciating, and are worse in the evening after dinner than any other time.  The level of pain makes healing very difficult.",5
very good ive only been able to tolerate 50 mg any higher gives me flu like symptoms  ,5
I tried this medication while it was going through the clinical trials.  There was 31 of us on the trial.  My bone marrow function went from 50% to 20% with one cycle.  I was removed from the trial and send start to having a stem cell transplant.  I thought I was going to die taking this medication.  I have had 2 stem cell tranplants to date and I have been in remission for 7 yrs now.  ,1

During injections experience nausea, dry reaching, headaches - some constipation due to nausea medication - some control with prunes & coloxyl & senna . 2-3 days after injections finish improvement in general well being headache rarer, nausea less - to the point where 1 week after injections have returned to some sort of normality - even allowing a 12 day fly/drive/van tour of central Australia in November 2016.  Then the grind starts again!!!!!! Have to remember the good days to get through the bad ones!",4

"This drug caused me to develop eosophilic pneumonia which, after only two treatments of Vidaza, almost killed me.  It took a huge team of doctors (pulmonologists, cardiologoists and the whole hematologists) to bring me back to some semblance of normalcy.  They took me off all MDS meds for three years.  I've been okay for three years but now because blood levels have dropped due to a virus, they are wanting me to try another drug.  Naturally I am very wary.",1

"Ten years ago at the age of 15/16 I received Vincristine as part of my chemotherapy program to treat a Ewing's Sarcoma variant on my rib. The treatment lasted for a year.  I am, it seems, fully recovered from the cancer, though I maintain that I am still suffering from the side effects of Vincristine. Whilst receiving the drug I experienced chronic and often severe join pain, in particular in my jaw, and in my ankles, the latter meaning I was unable to kneel or to sit still for more than a minute or so.  I have put three stars for satisfaction as I appear to be cured. However, my joints and circulation have never been the same since I was on Vincristine. Various doctors claim that the side effects are temporary, but I still suffer from chronic joint pain, 'cracking' joints (and joints that need to be cracked), tingling, and cold hands and feet; albeit far less severly than when I was on the drug. Sometimes the elbow joint in my left arm locks itself painfully and is only relieved when the joint eventually 'cracks'. I am aware that there could be many other reasons for these symptoms, but it is interesting that they were absent before I was given Vincristine. Though ultimately Vincristine helped save my life, I wish there was a cure for my discomfort.",5
I had T cell lymphoma on my face in 1994 & was treated with Vincristine. I'm 79 years old.. I wante dto give blood but They would not except me due to my past condition.,4
"I have been on chemotherapy for several months, including Vincristine, Adriamycin, Cytoxin and Retuxin.  About a week after my fifth of the six rounds I have been administered I woke one morning with severe problems speaking.  Today I was diagnosed with paralysis of my left volcal chord.  Since one of the side effects of Vincristine is peripheral neuropathy, which I have experienced, is it possible that this condition is a previously unknown side effect?",4
It has caused joint pain and jaw pain and constipation.  Right after she gets it she is very tired and after long term use she has a foot droping nerve sensations tingling in her feet and fingers.,4
I have Hodgkin Lymphoma and a cardiac condition so my oncologist suggested this as part of my treatment. I have a port and would recommend that to anyone who needs this.  I do have numbness in the fingertips but that seems to fade after I go off the drug.  ,4
At first really weak and sick but as the time goes by and you recieve more of the med you feel a little better,3
"I have mostly side effects such dry mouth,loss weight,appetite,hair lost,dizziness,palpitation,swelling of legs and hands,since the start of the treatment I change my diet to better deal with side effects overall I feel better now the doctor didn't add medication for anything but for lack of some minerals in my diet I taking supplements.",4
"I was diagnosed with Renal Cell Carcinoma in Dec. 2017, I had my left kidney, adrenal gland, and spleen removed in Jan. 2018. Lung scans showed enlarged lymph nodes, but when biopsied turned out they were Sarcoidosis with no malignancies. Due to the size of my tumor and itâ??s characteristics they started me on Votrient 600mg. Itâ??s been 2 months, I have some joint pain in my hips and knees, no diarrhea, some hair thinning. I go in for my 3 month Scan next week I pray for the best. Other side effects are a mediciney smell in my hands I notice sometimes. Overall Iâ??ve tolerated this drug well. ",5
"I have had a very poor experience. Could only tolerate 7 doses, and it is taking me several days to recover. Still haven't. Mouth sores, hypertension, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain, loss of taste. ",1
"Almost constant pain, nausea, fatigue, bruising, gum and teeth problems, GI issues.  I've been on for about 4 months and scans a month ago showed 25% shrinkage of all lymph nodes that were effected.  So I guess it's working.",4
"I was diagnosed with renal cancer in December 2015 and had my right kidney removed in January 2016.  My Oncologist had me undergo a CT scan every 2 months.  In August 2016 tumors in my lungs and lymph nodes showed significant growth.  A biopsy of several lymph nodes revealed renal cell cancer and I started taking 800 mg/day of Votrient in September.  After 3 months, I just completed my first CT scan and virtually all of the tumors from the previous scan had reduced in size, some as much as 50%.  I had difficulty adjusting to the Votrient initially as I take Prilosec for acid reflux and my Oncologist told me I could only take a dose in the morning if I take the Votrient at night.  I have been able to control the acid reflux by drinking concentrated Aloe Vera juice before bed time and purchasing a mechanical bed that allows me to sleep very comfortably with my head up about 30 degrees.  At one point my sodium got dangerously low and I was hospitalized for 3 days.  They had me reduce my water intake to 1.5 liters per day and this seems to have solved the sodium problem.  Now my biggest issue is neuropathy on the bottoms of my feet.  New more comfortable shoes, Capsaicin cream, and Merino wool socks have helped solve the problem.  My blood pressure increased initially, and I had never had blood pressure issues.  However, I have been able to return to working out – core exercises with a lot of repetitions and moderate weights with many repetitions- 3 times a week.  The result is that I am feeling stronger, have less fatigue, and my blood pressure has returned to normal.  I am extremely pleased with the results I am experiencing with Votrient after my body became used to it and I made the concessions to reduce the side effects.",5
"I was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in Feb. 2012, a tumor in my right thigh. Had chemo therapy and 5 weeks of radiation then surgery in June 2012 to remove the tumor. A few months later I had a tumor removed from my right lung. Then more tumors showed up so no further surgeries. Now I have it in both lungs and liver. After 8 rounds of chemo I started on the Votrient March 2014. First CT scans were very encouraging, no new tumors, all were stable or had minimal decrease in size. The last  scans were not as we hoped. Some had increased in size and a new one in my liver. I'm staying on the Votrient until Dec. then oncology is looking at changing to a new chemo oral drug. ",4
"I been on VOTRIENT for 2 weeks now. The 1st day I experienced the diaherria, vomiting, dizziness, & fainting. started taking ZOPHRAN & CAMPOZINE for all that thank God.

Oh also hair is growing black and white normally dark brown. white hair growing curly and black hair growing super straight very odd. My skin is starting to go white again skin clearing up better. Im satisfied at the moment with VOTRIENT but wont know till I get CT Scan in few weeks. Oh Im taking Votrient bcuz I have UTERINE SARCOMA HIGH GRADE STAGE 4 what a mouth full huh.

"I have been on Pazopanib since 05/11 after having Left kidney removed in 07/09. Due to side effects I came off it for 3 months 08-11/12 to give my body a rest. in this time my metastatic went from just my right lung  also into left lung. So I went back to taking 800 mg a day. Both tumours are stable at present, I put up with the fatigue,  diarhea, tingling fingers, sore mouth, & dryness. Pazopanib gives me a good quality of life where I can go away for many weeks at a time travelling.",3
"I am currently battleing mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.  It originated in my right thigh 2008, had the tumor removed, was cancer free for 3 years then was diagnosed last year with it again, with 5 tumors this time which had spread in my pelvic area, right lung and right armpit (July 2012).  I've tried a few chemo therapy treatments and during that time frame, the tumors grew plus one new one appeared.  In August 2012 I was placed on Votrient (800 mg), the tumors stopped growing and have been stable ever since.  My last scan was June 11, 2013 and all 6 tumors are still holding stable and have shown some shrinkage.  The side effects come and go, I am experiencing more muscle pain throughout my body and still some nausea, but those things can be controlled with meds. ",4
Had my right kidney removed 4/2011 and started sutent 2months later for almost a year and experienced negative side effects with no positive results. Changed to Afinitor and experienced no improvements but consistant swelling in the legs. Feb 2013 started Votrient at 800mg. Changed to 400mg after experiencing swelling of the tongue and throat and have had possible results so far. Looking for this to be the answer with Gods blessing.,4
"After having my left kidney removed in Oct 2010, spots in the lung were addressed. Started drug Jan 2012, reduced spots in lung by March but stopped reducing by end of May. White hair, lose of hair, lose of taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure, were all side effects that were tolerable.  The black spots in the vision were not. Since no further reduction to spots in the lungs, a switch to ""Everolimus"" is recommended. New side effects to look forward too!!!",4
"Thank you, Glaxo-Smith Kline!  After 7 days of taking Votrient, my tumors (soft-tissue sarcoma) have noticeably decreased in size.     On April 26, 2012, the FDA officially approved Votrient for Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Knowing that FDA approval was imminent, I began taking Votrient on April 21, 2012, for Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma in my left flank/retroperitoneal. I am a 22 year survivor of MFH sarcoma (now known as UPS), and had been on traditional chemotherapy for 8 years.  I had success with ifosfamide/adriamycin, and gemzar/taxotere.  But, my tumors mutated to grow resistant to those chemos. I have no surgical or radiation options.  VOTRIENT looks like it will prolong my life!  My doctor had given me 6 months, unless I could find a drug that would work.  I tried two clinical trials.    And, now VOTRIENT!    Compared to anything I have taken, Votrient has few side-effects.  I had a slight increase in blood pressure (that started on Day One).  I may have a little fatigue.  I couldn't tell you if my hair color is changing -- I have been bald for 8 years.  If I have any new side-effects or changes, I will report again.  Thank you, GSK and FDA (for fast-tracking the approval).   ",5
i think it has kept me alive,5
"I've been on Votrient over a year.  It has worked quite well on the soft tissue tumors, keeping them stable or shrinking, but not as well on the bone mets. Diarrhea did not become a problem until after the first six months. Other than hair color change, no other side effects. ",4
I began treatment for kidney cancer after having my left kidney remover. A spot then developed in my left lung. This was removed by sugery. Another spot developed in my right lung and was determined to be renal cell. I began taking voltrient 800 mg and after 5 mos and 2 wks this spot was gone. I stoped taking it for 3 mos and another spot occured. I have been back on voltrient for 6 mos and this tumor has reduced by 50%. Side effects have been almost constant diarrhea and some nausa. My hair has turned white and I have noticed some thinning.      d         ,5
"After having my left kidney removed and the failure of interleukin 2 treatments, my oncologist started me on votrient. 800 mg caused terrible hand pain and bruising, switched to a tolerable 600mg and have had shrinkage of the metastatic lung growths so far. 7 months so far on it and side effects include fairly constant diarrhea and all my hair turned white. Also have to take several relatively high dose blood pressure meds to combat the elevated blood pressure side effect.  ",5
"I have been on this drug since last Oct and have little or no side effects.  Had a cancer in my right in 1999 and the kidney was removed.  In 2009 I was ct'ed for 8 months until the Pulminologist has the area between my lungs biopsed,  showed 3 clear cell lymp nodes and one renal cell cancer.  Have been going to MD Anderson for over a year and my last vist (FEB) the doctor said 2 lymp nodes had schrunk and 2 were slitley larger.  Am optimistic and believe in MD Anderson.  Keep the faith and pray to God.",4

"I am also a diabetic taking glipizide.  When taking sutent my sugar increased, when taking afinnator my sugar increased, when I started taking this votrient my sugar decreased.  I was taking 10 mg twice a day and now I have backed off to 5 mg daily.  When I first started takng Votrient I had to close episodes with low sugar.  I've had to back off sugar medication until down to 5 mg daily and holding my own right now.  Yet I can find no reference to sugar in the list of side effects.  Do you have any?",4

I have been on this for almost 2 1/2 years. I did initially have trouble with diarrhea but that has gotten better with time. I do have a very slow heart rate but can manage that ok. I have Edema in my feet and ankles (one side more than the other.) my vision has actually improved for some reason.   ,5
 I have been on this drug for ten months..no terrible side effects...my ct scans show my cancer to be nearly gone. My once large lymph nodes are no longer considered to be pathological  ,5

I really can't identify a side effect and feel good most of the time. I'm regaining some strength and have even gained some weight.  And I've had great results.  The last CT scan showed all of my lymph nodes are normal in size, the pleural effusion is very small and the cancer in the lung has decreased.  I couldn't be happier! I'm just praying that I can take it for a long time.",5
"After six months, I have shown ""significant improvement"" in both lungs, have no shortness of breath and much more energy -- all without side effects! Certainly the easiest chemo ever, and by far the most effective that I've had in more than seven years!",5
"i have experienced nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances; sometimes seeing dark images out of the corner of my eye and when going from a dark room to a lit one.  i am pleased that xalkori has reduced the size of a lymph node on the bronchus of the right lung and so far has kept the cancer from spreading elsewhere.  i realize this is not a cure, but if it keeps the cancer stabilized in the right lung, i will be very happy.

"My mom was hospitalized three days after taking a low dose of this poison. Even before she started, she was not really eating and drinking (receiving hydration IVs three days a week). Her liver was so swollen that she could barely swallow her tiny pain pills every four hours. We had to be creative -using honey and Jell-O to keep pills from getting stuck in her throat.  I’m guessing that this drug is intended for younger or healthier people, and that in my mom’s case, it probably robbed her of some precious time with her family. She is so much weaker now than before.",1
After starting to take this drug my mom passed away shortly after this drug I think played a big part in her death please do not take this drug,1
Found 2mm spot on brain after stage 4 breast cancer. Was taking Herceptin but would not penetrate brain barrier.

"I have been on XELODA for 3 mon. after being on faslodex injections and xgeva for bone strength. I was treated in 2000 for stage 2 HER positive. It came back in my spine and now in my bone marrow. The doc is pleased with the XELODA, but I am concerned because my red blood cell count stays low because of cancer cells in my marrow and because XELODA also destroys red blood cells. Overall, I still have good quality of life . The hand/foot syndrome is troublesome, but I am managing with lots of coconut oil all day. I go to warm water therapy and PT to battle fatigue, bone pain, and muscle weakness. Gabapentin for neuropathy, Advil and oxycode for pain, and senecot for constipation are my major drugs/helpers. I am 65 years old and I pray that I am blessed with many years of productive living where I can love and care for for my family and friends and give back to the students I tutor as long as I so shall live.  I am constantly reading about new treatments. The comments and reviews on this site have been very comforting to me. Please everyone, keep sharing your experience with this drug.  Also, I am one patient who experienced very little nausea or diarrhea. All of the pain mess I use cause constipation, maybe that is why!  Oh, I have had many blood transfusions because of the cancer cells in my bone marrow and because of the effects of the XELODA . I know the docs can't keep doing that so I worry about what is next for me. To all patients, keep studying and praying and sharing. ",4
"About 4 years ago at age 67 I was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.  Half my rectum and a few inches of my lower colon next to my rectum were surgically removed, as well as a benign tumor in my right ascending colon and my appendix.  Fortunately I do not have to wear a pouch.  Biopsy of 23 lymph nodes in the area removed during the surgery revealed three positives, which classified me as a Stage III.  After a month of recovery from the surgery I received 25 radiation treatments over a 5 week period, with the primary side-effect of extreme fatigue.  After a month of recuperation from the radiation I began 4 months of oral Xeloda treatments, two weeks on and one week off.  Dosage was 3000 mg/day, 1500 mg at breakfast and 1500 mg in the evening.  the main side-effect was that my skin seemed to be aged about 10 years and was itchy.  The soles of my feet still feel like they have thick calluses but they do not.   A bizarre side-effect was that my fingerprints disappeared, and this appears to be permanent.  I experienced no significant nausea, hair loss or fatigue while taking the Xeloda.  Shortly after completing the Xeloda regimen I had a colonoscopy and there were no signs of cancer.  The doctor recommended a follow-up colonoscopy in about three years, which I had done a few weeks ago, and one benign polyp was removed but there were no signs whatsoever of cancer.  It appears that I am completely cured.  The doctor recommends another follow-up colonoscopy in about 5 years.  Based on my experience I would heartily recommend the Xeloda as opposed to intravenous chemotherapy.  The retail price for Xeloda is about $60 per 500 mg capsule, or $360/ day for 3000 mg, but it is discounted by over 80% for Medicare recipients.   ",5
"After two cycles, the Hand/Foot Syndrome began, mostly to feet.  I have been on this drug a little more than a year.  I have lost two toenails and it does cause some nail fungal stuff over a longer period of time.  I haven't experienced nausea/vomiting but do feel very tired at the end of the cycle.  Skin gets very dry.  Cool water/aloe on feet/palms helps.  Get comfy shoes and moisturizer often.  Also, take a Calcium/magnesium and drink lots of fluids as it can cause an electrolyte imbalance.

Caused second degree burns in my small intestines putting back in the hospital for ten days with severe pain,1
"I had breast cancer in 2000 which had spread to my spine in one of my vertebrae. I was prescribed Xeloda by my oncologist. Despite the severe side effects of hands and feet going red, blisters in my mouth and skin disorders, the oncologist insisted on this drug. I decided to terminate the use within 11 weeks. I am now experiencing numbness in both my hands, swelling and stiffness in all the joints of my hands. I believe patients should be warned about these side effects so that they understand the risks involved in taking such severe treatments. These side effects may take six months or even a year to appear. ",1
"My mother 69 years old diagnosed for rectum cancer. After 6 cycles of Chemo , doctor advised 4 different cycle of Xeloda starting from 3 tables in morning and 2 in night. My mother continues this for 4 cycles..during this time, she suffered a lot with side effects  - Skin turned to dark  - vomiting  - muscle reduction  - bone weakness  - loss of weight  She couldn't able to eat for 4 months and due to that her general health condition become worse and she passed away within 8 months of cancer treatment.   Please stop Xeloda incase if your disease not controlled in first or second cycle. ",1
"Misdiagnosed as ""cured"" after mastectomy 8-2011. I had no chemo or radiation.  Cancer came back in neck lymph node and under arm in mastectomy side.  I was put on Xeloda in July 2013 and have been on 2000/day 2 weeks on, 1 off since.  Neck lymph node gone, and other tumors drastically decreased.  I want to let all on Xeloda with hand/foot syndrome with bleeding sores on feet to try/use Tegaderm or same product by another company.  I suffered over a year with traditional bandaging with little luck.  A friend told me about this in December last year and currently all sores are healed.  Ask your doctor about this..mine hadn't thought of this use.  I have No connection with the company..it just works!",5
"My mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer in February of 2014. She started Chemotherapy right after the labor day holiday. She was fine even with her cancer, she could walk, run , we even went on vacation to help her relax when she started the chemotherapy. Well, she was supposed to take 3000 mg of Xeloda a day for 2 weeks, she got so sick of a mouth fungal infection caused by Candida albicans that she could not eat or drink anything. We took her to ER and her kidneys were only 10% functional. She had never had a kidney function failure in her life. She recovered by a miracle and by the carefulness of the doctors in turn. The oncologist stopped the medication and she was never given anything else. It took her 1-2 months to get better, but then she started getting worst. She finally died on November 2014. She was 75 years old. I could never understand why she was given the maximum dose being as small and old as she was. I hope this helps others decide to use this terrible medication. For my family and of course my mother,the remedy was worse than the disease. I think these kinds of medications should even be free if the risks are this high. Miss my mother terribly, because in the hospital, the doctors told me that they could not do anything else for her. It was really tough for her and for us to go back home and wait until she finally died. ",1
"1-16-2015. I have been on Xeloda for one year and despite the hand/foot issues, my CA 27-29 numbers have dropped from 89 to 13.  Breast cancer in 6-2007, now three tumors in liver 1-2014.  Tumors reduced by 40%. I am pleased with the results and pray all remains the same.   ",5
"THIS WAS NOT BAD AT ALL,, I was diagnosed 3 months ago with a stage 3 Colo-rectal tumor and 2 lymph nodes involved.  My Dr. Has had me on Xeloda and radiation therapy for 5& 1/2 weeks. I'd have to say that the ONLY side effect of the Xeloda was tiredness from having a reduced red blood cell count.. (it dipped down to 9.9 from 14)..  The radiation therapy has had WAY worse side effects.. My oncology nurse also told me that RARELY have they had to reduce the Xeloda dose due to side effects.. MOST people tolerate this chemo well, and I'd have to put myself in that category too. So I've got to tell you DO NOT jump to any worries over possible troubles. You'll most likely tolerate this drug well unless you're already very compromised physically.  Keep your chin up!!!",4
"Stage 4 breast cancer that spread to bones and liver. Lesions keep expanding, so started xeloda a month ago, 14 days of taking 4 pills, rest a week, then another 14 days... so far so good. However, I developed sever belly pains and started taking morphine. Had good sense to see gastro dr. and he took me off pain killers and gave me muscle relaxant pill and I am normal. I work full time, and have a sharp pain in the liver, and tingly fingers and toes, but I can live with that. What is meant to be is meant to be, and I live day to day thanking the lord for his gift and just purely enjoying being alive. good luck to you all. Adi",3
"Stage 3C Colon cancer 2010, treated with surgery and mod.folfox regime; anaphylaxis from oxaliplatin on 12th cycle. Recurrence Jan 2012.I am upto 42 x 3 week cycles-avastin infusion, 2 weeks of Xeloda (3000mg,)1 week rest. I went from multiple lung mets to 4 mets (largest 15mm x 8mm)and have been 'stable' for almost 3 years years. It is hard sometimes to differentiate 'aging' from drug interactions, but I feel blessed that my liver can metabolise this drug. Joint pain,frequent diarrhea etc can be managed and friends with arthritis are more 'slow' than I am. I have permanent neuropathy in hands and feet from the oxaliplatin but I have learned to manage this. I work fulltime and enjoy helping with my 3 grandchildren. My main problems are remembering to take the tablets and to 'pace myself' as fatigue can be a problem. I pray this drug continues to be effective",5
"My wife took this drug for 2 weeks in January of 2013.  After 2 weeks of this drug she was in the hospital for a week due to the sensitivity of her small intestine, which became completely blocked.  The treatment was very effective.  She starts on it tomorrow with a half dose.  We shall see",5
"After 2 weeks severe stomach cramps, diarrhea Had to go to hospital for IV after 2 weeks",3
It wasn't that bad the only thing was decoloration of my feet and hands....they turn very dark... other than that I tolerated.. better than the other chemo I took.. yuck...,5
very side effect,1
"Doctor started me on a full dose, hands and feet blistered and peeled,joint pain and nerves felt raw and not normal, my hand become weak and painful, then diarrhea and it got so bad, regardless of diet it would not stop without medicine and only then for the duration of the medicine. He took me off of Xeloda for about a month but I am still having uncontrolled diarrhea if Ido or don't take anything for it.My nerves through out my body have not regained their normal feeling yet, I don't think my intestines will ever be normal again.",1
"Xeloda may be of value if you weren't overly sensitive to standard IV chemo, but think twice if you were.  My husband was prescribed 4900 mg of Xeloda daily for just 1-1/2 cycles, before the side effects became unmanageable.  Even after stopping the Xeloda, the side effects continued to worsen until he was dehydrated, weak, nauseous, jaundiced, in v-tach and acute renal failure, and vomiting blood.  He also had mouth sores, hand foot syndrome, and what appeared to be a severe sunburn, though he hadn't been in the sun.  He lost 20 lbs in his month on Xeloda, even though he'd regained strength and 50 lbs in the prior 6 months when his metastatic colon cancer was stable and untreated.  I took him to the ER for rehydration and evaluation, and I lost him 29 hours later.  We'd seen his oncologist just 2 weeks earlier, after his first cycle. It wasn't worth it for us, but my husband didn't want to give up until there were no more options.  I believe I would have had him longer and he wouldn't have died in pain, if we'd made a different decision.  Xeloda was not worth it for us!",1
"I have colon cancer that came through colon wall. I’ve been taking xeloda for treatment.I took one 500 mg four pills per a day, one week on and one week. My dosage reduced due to side effects, primarily the hand and foot syndome. My hands cracking and peeling, my doctor gave me this cream “ UDDERLY SMOOTH “ it works and it is inexpensive cream. You can order from amazon.com – I hope this information can help you. God Blessed you all !!!",4
"I was diagnosed with rectal cancer in Dec. 2012.  I started 28 days of radiation and 2300 mg. of Xeloda daily, Monday through Friday; off Saturday and Sunday;  By the end of the 28 days, the tumor in my rectum was not even visible.  I had rectal surgery and an ileostomy in May, 2013.  Had the ileostomy reversed in July, 2013.  Started 3,000 mg of Xeloda after the reversal - 14 days on/7 days off, for 6 cycles. I'm finishing my 5th cycle now.  I deal with fluctuations between diahrrea and constipation, but nothing unbearable.  I'm just now starting to have the ""hand and foot"" problem, but am managing it with salve and lotions.  I would have to say that Xeloda has been a good experience for me. I have been cancer free for six months now.  ",5
"I have been on Xeloda for 3 years.  I have the cancer cells in my left lung and spine, hip and left leg bones. Stage 4.  Some new growth in the bones but no new growth in the left lung and no fluid build up.  I also have the hand and foot symptions and sometimes I can not walk and my hands are so smooth and sore I can't even hold an envelop. Wear gloves most of the time and us a cane. BUT,life does not stop and neither should you.  I still travel air, sea and land. And I have lots of praying friends and family. I have also changed my diet.  NO SUGAR and very little meat mostly vegatables and fruit, organic if I can. Go till the Lord calls you home.",5
"I took one 500 mg pill four days a week for six weeks to aid radiation in shrinking my rectal cancer before surgery.  I experienced nausea and diarrhea so much that I could not take it five days in a row, as prescribed. In fact, my doctor prescribed six pills a day, then down to four a day but my body could only take one a day. Genetics testing showed that using 5FU chemo would be toxic for me and Xeloda changes to 5FU after it gets in your body. Now, after surgery, I am on 150 mg Xeloda for palliative care since my cancer is Stage IV, in lymph glands and a lung. But since surgery removed my rectum and a portion of my colon, the Xeloda makes bowel spasms which cause very frequent BM's. Then my bottom gets very sore, bleeds, and gives excruciating pain. I found that taking half of a pain pill, hydrocodone, relaxes those bowel spasms, relieves pain, and enables me to continue taking the Xeloda. I am extremely sensitive to most medications; that is why I can tolerate only one Xeloda pill when many people take six a day.  The jury is still out on whether it will keep my cancer from growing, since I just started back on it.",4
"My husband was diag with rectal c Jan '12. 12 weeks radiation and Xeloda - 8 pills per day - surgery May'12 to remove tumor.  Permanent colostomy.  12 of 19 lymph nodes positive. August '12- Jan '13 - Xeloda 8 per day - 14 days on, 7 days off.  Huge interaction with metformin caused very ^ elevated blood sugar so has since been  on insulin. Insulin has been increased several times - blood sugar still not controlled. Were not informed of this side effect beforehand.  Mild stroke in December '12. Recent scan clear.  But today was told by endocrinologist that another side effect of Xeloda is decreased pancreas efficiency.  It was easy to take and for now we are cancer free - have to be 6 years free to be really free- but I think there are more side effects than folks know about.",3
"I am on my fifth two wk on one wk off and it has lowered my markers from 122 to 66.  This is after being on seven different IV chemo drugs.  Hand and feet syndromn has made my hands dark, dry, cracking and extremely sensative but just found a new cream that was advertised for ""woodworkers"" and it is awesome.  Called  Working Hands and available at hardware stores and building supply stores.  It heals and softens better than anything I have tried. (Also good for wrinkles-LOL) Just thought I'd pass this info on, as we need all the help we can get to keep fighting and living and remember-YOU CAN DO IT.",5
my hands become black...,3
After 2 wks. I had every side effect. Had to have Saline IV's and 2 U blood. Feet and hands burned and peeled. Vomit and diarrhea. It has been determined I was allergic to the 5fu component.  It did reduce my Ca153 in half. Needless to say it was stopped after 2 wks and will pursue another medication.,4
"I have been on the Xeloda for about 2 months 2 months this go around. Was on it initially but taken off. May not have combined well with the other IV treatment. Working well with Taxol and Faslodex.

"I am writing about my Father who had stomach cancer and metastasen all over his live and lymph nodes. It seemed like Xeloda was shinking the cancer drastically but my father did lose the battle with cancer. He had to stop the treatment with Xeloda because of a severe case of the hand and foot syndrome. the soles of his feet were extremly sore and he ahd open wounds all over. He got some creams from his doctor and they did not help much. I sent him some Climb on with is all natural and it worked like magic. This is the reason why I'm posting this. If anyone has open sorse, please try ""climb on"" climb on.com, its not expensive and its all natural you could even eat it. Take it to your doctor let him look at it if you aren't sure of it.

"Before surgery I was taking 3000 mg (1500 mg x 2) per day. I had severe hand foot syndrome develop and at day 28 developed severe nausea and diarrhea.  I was hospitalized for 16 days, lost 30 lbs and had to be fed wi a PICC line.  I did not stay close to my oncologist as it was all a new experience.  After recovery and surgery to remove my rectum pathology showed the tumor was dramatically reduced in size (from a golf ball down to a dime).  I continue at 2000 mg (1000 mg x 2) per day for two weeks then one week off.  I am in the fifth cycle and the hand and foot syndrome is present but bearable.

"Xeloda killed my 49 year old partner of 20 years. Darryl was the fittest, healthiest 49 yo I had ever known.  In February 2011 he was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer (we since have found out it was hereditary & unfortunately his family overlooked mentioning this to us).  He had successful surgery & chemo was recommended as cancer was found in 2 lymph nodes.  (The oncologist referred to this chemo treatment as ""spraying for the possible weeds"").   Darryl died as a result of incurring a ventricular fibrillation after completing his 3rd cycle of xeloda.  Unfortunately he had no warning of the VF, we enjoyed a great lunch, went for a walk up a gentle hill one afternoon, he felt slightly short of breath at one point, sat down & collapsed into a ventricular fibrillation. He had absolutely no previous history of heart problems.  We opted for a full autopsy and his heart showed no blockages or clots.  The oncologists have verbally admitted they believe Xeloda caused the VF.    The oncologists at the time of the initial consultation very much played down the side effects.  I have since made several complaints to the Auckland Oncology Department in New Zealand and they are currently considering adding a disclaimer which reads something along the lines of ""although it is very rare, chemotherapy could result in death"", this needs to be approved by their Legal Team I am told.   I am absolutely devastated at the death of my beloved life partner Darryl and absolutely furious that the full dangers of this drug were not disclosed to us.  I have since read several medical case study reports which clearly show coronary problems are a serious side effect of this drug. My belief is people need to be informed with all the facts & potential dangers of any drug they may choose to undertake. Only then can informed decisions be made.  Had the full dangers been adequately explained to Darryl & myself I know 100% Darryl wd not have opted for chemo, as he preferred the holistic appro",1

I take a multi-vitamin, extra selenium, and eat lots of protein bars too which I think all help with my energy levels. ",5
"I suffer from cholangiocarcinoma, a form of liver cancer, that begins in the bile ducts. Very rare in the U.S.. Lucky me!!! I am a 69 year old male. I have taken xleoda now since June 2008 to the present. In Jan 2007 I had the left lobe of my liver removed and ducts and was declared cancer free, had ""0"" margins at the incision. Xeloda turns into 5FU in your intestines. My cancer has shown up in my peroteneum, with several small nodules. Has been the same size for two and one half years. I credit the slow growth and the absence of new lesions to the xeloda, so do the doctors.",5
I am happy because the side effects have been very user friendly compared to what I  have seen with the normal chemo treatments!,5
"After taking xeloda for five days, I spent the next two weeks in ICU!!! I was lacking the 5FU enzyme. That was discovered at the hospital when they ran genetic testing...of which my insurance has denied to pay for.  Before taking this drug, ask many questions and get tested if possible.  ",1
"I had stage 2b esophageal cancer that was surgically removed six years ago.  After five years it came back in four lymph nodes around the area where the original cancer was.  After 15 weeks of Chemo & Radiation treatments there was no sign of cancer in my pet scan and my markers went from 297 down to 20.  I have been on Xeloda for the past 13 months and I have had four additional clean pet scans and my cancer marker are down to a two (2).  I tolerate the drug well and it has virtually no side effects.  I take 8 500mg tablets daily, seven days on, then seven days off.  It has worked great for me.",5
"the only side effect I have encountered is cramps in my feet, especially my toes and I have not heard of anyone else having this experience",4
"Feel much better on Zeloda than Gemzar, less side effects, 8 500mg daily 1 week on 1 week off. Feel tired 3 days after stop taking.",5
no side effects ,5
I have been taking it for 4 months. i have not had any bad side effects. Right now the cancer is gone. ,5
"I am a 25 yr who was diagnosed with stage 2 colon cancer. After having surgery to remove the side of my colon that the cancer was in I was prescribed Xeloda for six months. I experienced extreme hand and foot syndrome, where my hands and feet would throb in my sleep and throughout the day. Every crack in my hand ached and peeled to the point that I had to wear gloves all day, including to bed. My hands and feet turned bright red and I formed sores on the bottom of my feet and could only wear Uggs or slippers. It caused me to have insomnia and strange dreams, this along with the other side effects lead my oncologist to take me off from work until I had completed my six months of chemo. I was extremely tired most of the time and lacked energy. I recommend Gold Bond hand cream or Ca Reez for the hand and foot syndrome. Believe me when I say that I tried every cream and lotion imaginable to try to assist with the itching, burning, and blisters. These two, especially Ca Reez, helped to ease the pain. Though the side effects were extreme I would prefer this treatment over IV chemo or radiation anyday. The benefits were worth the six months of discomfort. Once the medicine gets out of your system for a few months you will go back to feeling normal. ",5
"I started Xeloda 8/6/10 for metastatic colon cancer.  I had 6 months of FOLFOX after colon resection and removal of my ovaries.  I had no evidence of disease after surgery and starting chemo.  However, 6 months after finishing chemo small freckles on my lungs, and 1.8 cm lesion on my liver.  Back on chemo, this time FOLFIRI.  Had good success with this 3 of 5 freckles gone, liver lesion down to .5 cm.  They put me on Xeloda for maintenance.  I take 4 (500 mg) tablets twice a day.  I have some neuropathy in my feet from IV chemo but it hasn't seemed to worsen with Xeloda.  They warned me to be aware usually on the 11th day (today) for redness and even blistering.  Praise God not so far.  The worst side effects I have experienced are headaches, joint pain and stiffness, and slight nausea at times.  We shall see how my blood counts are on Friday.  CT 2 - 3  months out.  Good luck to all of you and may God Bless you richly.",3
"Been taking this drug for about 10 months. Markers went down considerably from 800- around 40. No side effects. Just very tired. Markers started slowly climbing and the jumped to 121 in 1 month. So all in all I was doing well. Not sure what is next. Going to have a PET scan done soon. Best wishes to all! I felt very lucky not to have ""any"" side effects. I escaped this one!",5
"I have been taking Xeloda for almost a year. It seems to working as my extreme bone pain has nearly gone away. I have not had hand and foot reactions, but I get sores on my legs that are very itchy. My face and arms have become darker and freckled, probably as the result of sun exposure. I also have lost some taste as part of my tongue is somewhat numb. I developed mild pneumonia last spring and now have fluid behind my other lung which has been drained 4 times but keeps recurring. They have found no evidence of cancer in the fluid so the cause is unknown. Related to Xeloda? No idea.  All in all, I am happy to be able to take it without having severe side effects. ",5
the mediction is reducing the size of the tumors in my lymphnodes ,5
Have been on this drug for four months -count has gone from 140 t0 37-have some hand and foot discomfort and digestive problems but nothing that one can not tolerate-I have it in may locations-lungs bone- liver-- am hopeful that it will give me some extra life ---am experiencing sleepless nights-- would recommed this for anyone who could try it to do so ,5
"This drug has really been rough on me.  One week on, one week off-3- 500 and 1-150 am and pm.  Done it for 2 weeks and can't eat or drink much and dia. won't stop.  Going for IV fluids today.  Wish I was tolerating it better.  For 3 days could hardly walk on feet.  Really has incapacitated me.  Don't have a TM yet to know if it is helping.  Suppose t start it again Sunday and looking for Dr to lower dosage.  My body isn't even recovered from last round.  I really want this to work... ",3
"I was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2006 with a reoccurance in 2008 which ended with me having an ileostomy.  When Avastin stopped working, my oncologist suggested Xeloda due to me having a mutated Rask gene.  The only thing that happened was a severe reaction with painful feet and hands and my levels going up instead of down.  So this did nothing for me.",1
"I have been taking Xeloda for over 6 months. My side effects began with very much pain in every part of my body. (This may also be the Avastin). I have developed hand-foot syndrome. I've lost all the skin off the bottoms of my feet and I'm now my hands are peeling. IMy feet and hands are very sesitive to anything with a texture. I even have trouble opening a water bottle. sometimes i want to stick my feet in buckets of ice! but most of the time it is bearable. I treat my feet with a layer of pure aloe vera gel and then a layer of Eucerin cream.  I tried Udder Cream but my feet were on  FIRE!   I just recently developed severe eye irritation which I brushed off as bad contacts or pollen in my eyes. I finally went to my eye doctor and he found severe eye irrition and swelling in my cornea. After speaking with a corneal specialist, he determined it was the result of taking Xeloda. I am now using gel eye drops and antibiotic eye drops. In a week or two it should be cleared up. I hope this helps someone who is wondering about Xeloda side effects!",5
"very bad rash which has not healed & causes a lot of discomfort--also, a lot of bleeding from the sores--many appear on my face but worst are on my legs & chest",4
"terrible shkin rash, blisters, on face, neck & shoulders general feeling tired & ill",2
I take Xeloda M-F in the am with food 3 pills and another 3 pills in the pm with food. No side effects with hands or feet. It does upside by stomach alittle. Been on it for 3 full weeks. ,3
"I had breast cancer in 2001 and it has returned as mets to my liver, kidney and pelvis bone. I had no success with IV chemo but have had shrinkage of lesions on the liver and no growth on other areas with xeloda. Side effects, hands and feet not too bad, diarreah has been my main concern and my dose has been lowered to 3 in the AM and 2 in the evening.",4
"Xeloda caused severe hand/foot syndrome and was very expensive, even with insurance.  Not sure I would take it again",4
"It was very easy to use, I was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer may 08 and started chemo in July I started with the cocktail switched to xeloda but within just a few days of taking it I developed neuropathy in both my hands and feet the hands and severe abdominal pain. Still not sure how effective.",3
"i was taking xeloda 8 500 mg per day stomatitis (mouth sores)  hand and foot reaction. was my reaction i am now on reduced dosage 6 500mg per day the side effects have resided about 90% any thoughs i had head of pancreas removed jan 09 november new lesion abuts the superior mesenteric artery ,splentic vein s,and superior mesenteric vein ans celiac pancreatic body is surgery a option my dr. said",4
This medication has lower my tumore cell counts.  I am on a very low dose as I had a sever hand/foot reaction.  I take 2 pills morning and evening for one week on and one week off.  I do feel tired most of the time but nap and sleep well at night. I have been on this medication for 2 years.,4
I have taken xeolda a little over a year.   I have lung cancer and liver cancer. The last CT scan (Feb 2010)showed no increase or activity in the tumors. I tolorate xeloda much better than IV Chemo.,5
very heavy flatulation at night,4

BE POSITIVE HAVE FAITH IN GOD AND KEEP YOUR FIGHTING SPIRIT INTACT AND ALSO THE INFORMATION ON XELODA(MOVING FORWARD WITH XELODA) GIVEN TO ME BY WEBMD HAS HELPED ME AND MY FAMILY TO BE PREPARED AND FIGHT. SO THANK YOU.  I ADVISE ALL JUST DON'T BE NEGATIVE EVEN IF THE DOCTORS SAY BECAUSE A POSITIVE MIND, THE MEDICINES OF COURSE AND A GOOD DIET(EAT SMALL BUT NUTRITIOUS ESPECIALLY YOUR BREAKFAST) REALLY CAN WORK MIRACLES EVEN IF THE STAGE IS BAD. JUST DONT GIVE UP. XELODA IS GOOD.",2
I was diagnoed with stage II colon cancer.  I have found that soaking my feet in ice tea relieves the foot pain.  After soaking I apply aquaphor healing ointment.  ,3
My experience with this treatment was  a  challenge I had every symptom  from  the Xeloda. My  doctor reduced this chemo 3 times,3
"I am taking xeloda for colon cancer that had not spread to any other part of the body, the tumor was removed sucessfully. I tolerate the medication well and have not experienced most of the common side effects except diarrhea.",4
"I was prescribed 1300 mg of Xeloda twice a day following removal of a cancerous rectal polyp while having radiation treatment.  I had no stomach problems, but the 5th day of treatment I had back & chest pain though tests proved I did not have a heart attack. I have been taken off the drug, and they assume I have vascular disease of the small blood vessels perhaps due to diabetes. Be careful and report any unusual symptoms.",2
"My husband has been taking 2 tabs twice a day since beginning of Aug (2 wks on & 1 wk off). He has metastasis to liver and lymph nodes. He is on cemcidabine infusion (3 wks on & 1 wk off). He is doing well on both. Minimal GI cramps and low blood counts, fatigue, & shortness of breath but recovers pretty well during the week off. The MD's are watching his heart function as the treatments have affected the pumping action causing the shortness of breath. He has another staging in Dec. Last staging in Sept. showed slight shrinkage off the pancreatic and liver tumors. He was diagnosed the 3rd week of July.",5
My husband was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer. He is 47. He did xeloda during the week at home and oxcilaplatin infusion once a week.  It definitely shrunk the tumor. He has had surgery now and will have to have more chemo.  all in all it worked but he will have to have more chemo.,4
"I have been on Xeloda for 2 years, stable since 2007, no hand foot problems. It has worked for me so far. Pray it continues.",4
"I am writing as an update. I was the person diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer that spread to the liver. As I previously wrote I went into remission after 4 months of taking Xeloda, Oxilaplatin and Avastin. To further update you my tumor came back slightly in the wall of the esophagus in May of 09. I was operated on in July to have the esophagus removed and today November 4, 2009 have returned to work again fulltime. I am having my bloodwork checked every 4 months and petscans every 6 months. I am also being advised by Surgeon and oncologist that it is very unlikely that the tumors will return. While Xeloda may cause drying and cracking of extremities my using cream nightly took care of those issues. I used xeloda to different degrees for almost 8 months. I was on origianlly 5 pills in am and pm then down to 3 in am and pm and then 2 twice daily. There are side affects but in my experience everything worked out as well as you could have hoped. You must stay positive and do not let negative thoughts enter into your treatment. I was even told by relatives to make sure I had all my arrangements in place to make my passing easier on my wife and children. I hope my experience helps you and your family.",4
Just started the drug. Too early for any answers.,2
I took this drug for 6 days and had a heart attack. Had to have a sthent put in. They told me the drug caused a blood clot.,1
Ihave been on and off for nearly 3 years.  It has been wonderful except for the hand/foot syndrome and upset stomach.  I had a clear scan 6 months ago but now cancer is active again in my spine so another 6 months of Xeloda.  Sure beats any other chemo I have had regarding side effects.,5
"Just finished up 6 weeks of Xeloda and radiation for rectal cancer.  I was diagnosed in June with stage 2 cnacer that has not spread.  I was taking 1300mg/day orally.  I had almost no reaction at all.  Occasional dry mouth, minor stomach cramps (rarely) and some diarhea, which could also be partially from the RT.  Overall it wasn't too bad.  I'll find out soon how effective the RT/Xeloda worked.  I will have surgery to remove the tumor in the coming months.",4
only had one day with upset tummy.,4
"Had colon/rectal cancer, and just finished six months on Xeloda.  Do not know yet if I am clear of other cancer.  I have a nodule on my right thyroid, which I am going to have removed sometime soon.   Did not lose my hair, but had severe reaction on my hands and feet.  (They were sore, and peeled several times).",3
"I had a stage2 tumour removed along withmy ascending colon ,cecum and appendix in April...they found three lymph nodes w/microscopic cells which kicked it up to a II-c(I think that's correct) which led to the xeloda. The first two weeks I was on 5-500MG pills;twice a day..I ran a fever, had constant running to the bathroom day and night, upper gastric pain..well, you get the idea. The doc lowered my dose to 4-500MG pills-twice a day the next two weeks with everything improving BUT the trips to the bathroom...eventually I was lowered to two -500MG pills twice a day after I lost the skin from my feet(they are nice and soft now)they did nnot hurt me as much as they freaked out the doctor...Udderly Smooth helps IMMENSELY)  I am on my last two weeks; my blood work(hematicrit and hemoglobin) are higher than they have been in 6 and years my cancer marker is lower than normal peoples'(whatever that might mean)NOW if my hair quits falling out I should be fine...

"I have tolerated xeloda fairly well.  Each cycle causes hand and foot syndrome which is very painful at times  I use lotion and cream on my hands and feet.  This relieves the burining sensation, I also use ice to cool my feet.",5
"Have been on Xeloda for 3 months with 2 brief breaks.  Looking at another 4 months of use.  Each cycle (4 pills twice a day) of 2 weeks on and 1 week offf, the side effects hit earlier and harder.  Mostly feet are cracked and painful -- like walking on broken glass.  Tons of cremes help a little, but most stop working after a cycle.  However, it's all worth it -- my tumors are shrunk by 2/3 are it's still working.  Joy, oh joy.",4
"Before starting this med, I was having severe chest pain any time I coughed, sneezed or breathed in deeply. Cancer marker was in the 16000 range and after 3 months down to 500 range. Initially had to lower dose due to mouth sores. Currently feet feel like I've been walking barefoot on hot pavement. Need to stay off feet more.",5
"I took Xeloda together with radiation, three 500mg pills morning and night and had a lot of unpleasant side effects. Now I'm starting Xeloda again without radiation, one week on, one week off for six months. ",3
"My cycle has changed from 4 tablets twice per day for 2 weeks to 1 week on, one week off.  This has helped the hand and foot syndrome from being so painful.  I have lost my finger prints, but crime free! I combine this medicine with Femara once pe day, and all tests are within the acceptable range after 4 months on Xeloda. I feel it is helping me,stiff muscles being the biggest challenge.",4
I want to know what Xeloda is supposed to do.,5
do not take if you're having dental work or infection-antibiotics won't work if you're on xeloda,3
"Origninally diagnosed with Breast Cancer stage 2 I received the normal chemo but found out 1 year later that it had spread to my liver.  After receiving carbo, as an IV chemo it blasted away the left side of the liver and although it saved my life the side affects were awful.  Now taking Xeloda 500 mg/day 2 in the am and 2 in the pm, I have quality of life.  CA27-29 has dropped but after being on this drug for 5 months the numbers are now holding around 85. Only feet get sore and red, no diahrea, but some muscle soreness.  Sure beats the IV chemo. After not working for a year,I have returned to work 2 days a week. It's good to have my life (almost) back! 52 year old female in Vermont.",4
"I have been taking Xeloda since Sept 08 and have tolerated the side effects well.  During the last two cycles, the hand and foot syndrome has been much worse. I use lotion every night with gloves and socks.  My hands and feet are very sore during the last one or two days of my ""on"" weeks. I have been working full time with only two days off this school year and that was due to my daughter being sick.  The drs. are impressed with the results as they found ""healing"" on my 3 month scans. I do find that I get tired at the end of the day --I just take things a bit slower.  Enjoying life to the fullest.   ",5
"My 81 year old mother was diagnosed Mar08 with Stage IIIC colon cancer.  Doctor did not recommend standard chemo cocktail as being to harsh for Mother to handle.  We decided to start her on Xeloda 4 pills (500mg) daily and have gradually increased to 7 pills with minimal side effects.  She was fatigued and dizzy shortly after taking morning dose (not sure if due to this drug or other meds that she takes) but appetite has been good, very slight nausea and no diarrhea.  Dispensed by crushing pills in yogurt-bad tasting and large for her.  After 8 mos cancer has spread to liver.  Currently evaluating whether to pursue other options including irinotecan iv. As with any medication, recommend to take with small meal to reduce side effects.  If concerned about this drug, I suggest to confer with doctor regarding beginning with low dosage to evaluate tolerance.  ",3
my cancer marker has been lowered a lot when nothing else helped.,5
"My husband had been on Xeloda for 3 days and was rushed to the hospital 911 with a possible Heart attack.  He has never had a Heart problem,  However since his surgery with Colon/Rectal cancer there has been numerous problems with the latest being an adverse reaction to the drug Xeloda.  After determining there were no clogged arteries and identifying his use of the drug above it has been brought our attention this was and is a side effect. We were given numerous side effects of the drug however never told this could be a fatal side effect. The diagnosis was due to taking the drug Xeloda, my husband had what is defined as Acute Myocardial Infarction - NSTEMI secondary to vasospasm.  He was sent home with Nitroglycerin and diltiazem. He has been instructed to stop using the drug Xeloda. ",2

ALl of a sudden he started to loose his appetite.Then he started the loose bowls and now,since he was admitted to the hospital last night he started vomiting.AT first the oncologist said oh it wasnt from the xeloda he might have a bug.But P.S,After the surgen and his primary Dr seen him they ALL now agree it is the Xeloda.

Too early to tell,5
"Since I don't hold things(food) down very well, it (Xeloda) is coming up more than staying in my system.  However, this may be my only hope for now, since IV chemo has become too risky for me to handle.  I believe there may be some other factors that have come about, so I may not be able to give a proper analysis.",3
"I have taken Xeloda for 15 months.  Tumors in hip and neck have not grown and one lymph node in lung has remained the same size.  I have hand and foot syndrome and had to take a brief rest to heal, but am very pleased with the results.  Dr. is satisfied with the results also.

She became sick with nausea and severe diarrhea on Jan 27 and was taken to the hospital on the Jan 29th. We were told it was a severe reaction to the Xeloda and they could not get the diarrhea under control. She was not able to eat much and became worse. On Feb. 4th,2008 she passed away in the hospital. we believe it was due to the Xeloda. Be very careful and get immediate attention at first sight of severe diarrhea. while on the Xeloda. We believe the Xeloda is the reason she died so quick. ",1
"My good friend, Catherine (who is in her mid-twenties and was in excellent condition), is suffering from Liver Cancer, which has spread to parts of her lungs and spine. She was diagnosed May 2007 and is on several chemotherapy treatments. One month ago (or less) she was prescribed Xeloda due to previous medicines' side effects. However, Xeloda is giving her stomach problems possibily due to one if its side effects of not being able to keep food down. Can anyone recommend foods that easily digestable alongside this medicine? Also, you may read her story and leave a note in her guestbook at her website: www.caringbridge.org/visit/catherinehutton  ... Thanks! -Susan",3
"This was a ""last resort"" treatment,because the IV chemo treatments caused my kidneys to shut down. I have been going along, doing CAT scans to track cancer spot growth on my lungs. Now I am near my end, so the dr. wanted me to try the Xeloda oral. First dose caused severe trouble breathing, severe dizziness, extreme muscle weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, so cold they had to pile blankets on me, and edema. This was not for me. These are all signs of ""a very serious allergic reaction"". All I am saying is have medical help handy when you first try it. Maybe take it the first time in the dr's office, or sit in the local emergency room's waiting room. That was my dr's suggestion.",1
"Xeloda killed my mother.  She died on December 27th, 2007, ten weeks after starting a Xeloda regimen.  She was 83,  and she was in very good shape before beginning her treatment, in spite of the presence of secondary liver cancer (breast cancer metastasis).    The drug destroyed the lining of her digestive system, and allowed a combination of bacterial infections to attack and kill a portion of her small intestine.  She was within hours of death when emergency surgery repaired her intestine on 11/24/07.  It appeared as though she would  recover from her surgery, but she contracted pneumonia while hospitalized, and her system was too weak to fight back.  I am heartbroken.  I don't want my mother's death to prevent others from seeking proper  treatment, but everyone should be aware of the dangers presented by bacterial infections that could cause major damage while this drug is being administered.

They gave me meds for the nausea and they help.  The headaches are excruiating but I'm not going to stop the Xgeva I just want them to find something to help the headaches!,4
I am getting worried as am having more trouble breathing and do not wish to stop this drug.  I am also getting more tired.  I am not able to take zometa as I had a terrible reaction to it.  I don't believe ther are any more options.  The test results have been very good as I take this along with Megace.  It is just an injection every month and quite easy.  I usually don't feel very good for a few days but compared to  others it is nothing.  I am worried about the breathing however.,5
Treatment. Of breast cancer,3
Xtandi did not work. My dad died 3 months after starting the drug. Side effects stopped him from living his last months in peace. ,1
"I has been taking this Xtandi from bonhoa.com for 8 weeks , PSA went from 38.7 to 31.2 in this period. I hope it will start to decrease quickly soon! I am treating prostate cancer for 5 years, bone mets since 2017. No side effects from xtandi so far. This items from India is 60% lower price than US. It helps me a lot",5
"88 years with metastisized prostate cancer. After 60 days PSA  down from 5.0 to .015 but great fatigue, loss of appetite from bad metallic taste in mouth. ",3
I have been taking Xtandi for 7 months and so far my PSA had dropped and stayed low. For side effects I experience joint pain and it has slowed me some.,4
"My father was placed on Xtandi 160mg daily beginning May 2, 2017.  His most recent PSA from April 25, 2017 was 31.65.  After two weeks on Xtandi, his PSA was 37.39.  After two more weeks through June 1, his PSA was 54.56 so Xtandi appears to have accelerated his cancer as the tumor in his lung doubled in size from March 14 - June 2.  This drug appears to have harmed my father.  To make matters worse he paid over $3,000 for a new month of which only four days were used and has to consider throwing almost 90% of this new bottle away.  Considering legal action for the potential harm.",1

Joined the trial and along with the ""normal"" hormone treatment had 6 lots of intense radio therapy. PSA down to less then 1. November last year PSA had increased to 5.6 which is trigger point on the Stampede trial for additional treatment. Start Xtandi early January and PSA down to less then 1 again in 3 weeks.

Last two PSA showed slight rise and the bone mets showed s slight increase in size. So, at this time I do not know what if it will clear the mets or not. Life is bad with absolutely no energy. Take Ritalin twice a day and that helps keeps me moving. No appetite and everything has a metallic taste. Will start Canabis oil this week and see if that helps. Gone from 136 to 129.

Taking this medication for a period of45-60 days. Have not yet seen any reduction in PSA. Medication leaves you in a fatigue state.,1
I had a PSA of 8500! I also had spinal cord compression that left me a T10 paraplegic and  (after 3 months of hospitalization) confined to a wheelchair. Bone marrow biopsy showed that my marrow was almost completely replaced by tumor tissue and thus I was not able to make blood and was so anemic that I required 8 blood transfusions to stay alive. My oncologist decided to try Xtandi. After 3 wks I began making my own blood and my present PSA after 5mos is 7-8 and MRI shows extreme tumor remission around my spine. I am beginning to walk with a walker and hope to move to a cane soon. And they said I would never walk again! Needless to say I am extremely pleased with Xtandi. The fact that it is an oral medication instead of a veinous infusion is a plus that I am most grateful for.,5

"The day before my third infusion, I suffered from diarrhea. I became severely dehydrated and the diarrhea was uncontrollable. While at the clinic, i became confused and was transported to hospital and treated for altered mental state. Stayed four nights. This occurred a couple weeks later, again four nights.",3
"My husband had all 4 doses, often taking the whole morning (2 hour drive each way each time was hard on him), and when finished we had high hopes, but it didn't work.  Tumors have progressed rapidly.  :(",1

"I have metastatic Malignant Melanoma in both lungs.  To date, the drug has stopped the growth of the tumors.  I am now one year from dianosis and feeling fairly well, with the exception of lupus-like symptoms ... achy joints and fatigue being the dominant effects.",4
"This drug caused near fatal reaction to my husband, just got out of the hospital after spending 6 days on steriods at KU Med Center. Caused extreme dehydration.",1
"I had this drug in the last clinical trials before it was approved. I only had a few side effects like skin inflammation and tiredness. It did cause me to have low platelets. But, that is managed with Promacta. I would highly recommend this drug!!!!!!!",5
I don't know the results yet.. and I have not been able to tolerate a complete dosage as I became dehydrated as I was very sick just prior to starting this drug and just got worse. I am back on the drug but weather in the NE has made it hard to stay on schedule. ,3
This drug is in a solution with Sorbitol. As a Type 1 diabetic this sent my blood sugars dangerously high. There was no warning for diabetics and I can see no sugar free alternative. Will be refusing it from now on. ,1
Usually get Neupogen shots and they are effective.  Xarxio did nothing for me whatsoever.  My blood levels got worse.   ,1
I had to drop from 300mg to 200 mg due to extreme fatigue and side affects. The 200 mg dose in combination with sugar free low carb diet made a wonderful combination with much more energy and I have been on this Almost 2 years now after I had a recurrence. Praying it keeps working! ,5

"I felt like a new person after just 2 days on this medication! I am still feeling that way after 5 weeks. After a few weeks, my skin began to change as we expected. I already had ""bumpy"" issues with my skin. It was just cosmetic and herditary. Now I have to moisturize twice a day to reduct the ""Itching"" of the skin. My hair has changed texture and is a little thinner. Other than that, I have had no side effects so far. I cannot complain as I am feeling so much better.  Before I started taking it, I was becoming very ill from the cancer. I had nausea, pain, fever, etc... I have never been on radiation or chemo. This is the first medication I've had for my metastatic melanoma. I feel so blessed to have this extra time with my family, and I am blessed to feel so much better.",5
I had the Zevalin treatment in Dec. 23.  So far still fatigued from 8 treatments of R-chop. I am wondering if anyone has ever relapsed after receiving Zevalin. But so far can not find any information. I had stage 4. Since 04,4

"I used this treatment in combination with Rituxan for my stage 4 follicular non hodgkins lymphoma. I was given this as first line treatment and had awesome results.  I am now 5 years in remission and have been discharged by my oncologist as all PET and CT scans have been unchanged and no return of disease.  The only down side was my counts dropped very low and I had to have Procrit shots to increase the levels.  I had more trouble with the Rituxan than the Zevalin, Rituxan infusion had to be done slow 5-6 hours due to me having reaction to the med throughout my treatment, but I just fell asleep during the treatment and went home fine afterward.  I would recommend this treatment without any reservations.",5
"It worked great the first two days of use although it made me feel dizzy, sleepy and gave me a slight headache but after that it just stopped working. ",1
The headache is worth the relief from nausea ,5
"Do not use Zofran. My daughter took it for 2 weeks. She was 29 yrs old and 3 month pregnant. It was prescribed for morning sickness. It burned her insides out. She looked like she was burned from head to toe.She died 24 days after she took this drug. Love you Jess , I miss you!",1
"I have really bad allergies and in the mornings I'd be nauseated from my sinuses draining to my stomach while asleep. I'd get up the next morning gagging and retching, but not really vomit anything but stomach acid. My PCP gave me Phenergan to take at night. But it wore off and the next morning it's the same old thing. But I'd take it in the mornings with Benedryl and my sinuses would stop draining and not be nauseated. My Pain Mgmt Dr. gave my Zofran (generic)and said it's stronger then Phenergan and to let it dissolve under my tongue. It tasted awful and didn't want to dissolve. I have Spinal Stenosis in my neck and 3 Degenerated disk (2 are also herniated) and still have to laid down from my lower back hurting. If I closed my eyes, it felt like I was spinning. Not like when people drink and say the room is spinning. I felt like I was tumbling with spinning (like high divers in the Olympics spinning, twist and all, haha). I'd still feel nauseated but not as bad as first thing every morning. Then around noon or so, I'd get sick again and take another half. I usually then can't eat anything until after 5 or 6 O'clock in the evening. It's 1:30 p.m. and took a half one at noon. I still feel nauseated. I prefer the Phenergan and it never made me sleepy like it does most. Well, I'd been taking it for 5 years and the first couple of times it did but then I built a tolerance and the sleepiness stopped after a a week or so.",2
Don't take this drug Zofran. My daughter died from it. She was pregnant only 29.,3
I was given Zofran for nausea from pain medication after bone fracture then surgery.  It is as effective as Phenergan without the extreme drowsiness.  I did get a bad headache once but not every dose.  I really like that it dissolves under the tongue and starts working quickly.  It is not as effective if the nausea has already started.,4
Zofran does just cause a headache it causes extreme migraines.  The next day headache is worse than the nausea. If needed for chronic nausea or chemo etc may be ok.  Otherwise think twice about taking.  Drs WON'T listen about this.  Phenegran still best especially when knocks you out until you feel better.  Why won't Drs listen about this ?   Are they getting paid to prescribe Zofran?  It does make you feel better but we have people able to function on this drug going out in public spreading the stomach bug because of this drug!,1
Used for nausea due to gallbladder surgery.,5
Was given this drug in the ER d/t a drug reaction to Cymbalta. I am allergic to Compazine and this was considered a safe alternate It stopped my excessive nausea and vomiting. I had two rounds in the IV and was sent home with pills that worked very well. ,5
"can someone tell me why my doctor prescribed me zofran if zofran has been not FDA approved for pregnant women. I have heard from tv ads, family, friends and FDA sights saying not to take because it causes complications with the unborn child. My obgyn stated not to pay attention to the FDA that its only 1/8 chance something would happen. why would he prescribe me something if it could possibly endanger my unborn child?",2
I was given this during pregnancy for severe nausea and vomiting and it helped significantly and I was able to eat a little bit. I tried to take it as little as possible (usually just one pill on the days I needed it). Then years later I had to have a prescription for this because I suffered severe pain due to a medical condition that required me to take Vicodin when pain was so severe. The Vicodin would make me nauseous (as does any strong pain med for me) and this medicine helped that nausea to go away. So this does work like it's supposed to and it's a great medicine. ,4
This drug has given me horrendous headaches taking it one-half hour before taking four Votrient tablets (chemotherapy). I was switched to Compazine and Tylenol from Ibuprofen for headaches.  The Compazine made a world of difference.,3
"Took while on chemo and radiation , never got nauseous . Now take 1/2hr before chemo and have had great results. Once I forgot to take of zofran and I will never forget again.",5
It's the worst medicine for pregnant women who take it during their first trimester I myself have took this  medicine  an my baby girl came out with a cleft palate  an her bone wont grow in her mouth an had two surgeries already In her short two year life more to come because of the docter an the manufacturer of the  med lied to me about the side affects of zofran an illegally off labled prescribed it to me. I know suffer heart problems also. Prolonged QT right bundle branch blockage and nitro valve prolapse. I also loved Zofran. I was prescribed it on an as need basis. Look at what I am now suffering. My daughter will suffer the rest of her life because of this medication i thought was god himself in a pill. I will never forgive GlaxoSmithKline for the horror they have caused in my life.. Just because some of these women have had babies safely on this medication don't mean it's safe. This medicine is not at all approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy yet doctors earn Lamborghinis and Ferraris for writing so many prescriptions for GlaxoSmithKline. It's illegal. GlaxoSmithKline was sued by the government for $3billion for fraudulently pushing this medication off label to doctors. With profitable gain. My daughters mouth isn't growing because of these selfish rich scum and once do you think they have thought about what it has done to her. No. Why. Because they are making millions a day off of this un safe non FDA approved medication that can even cause death in mother and baby. Thank about it. I would rather be sick then to be stupid and take the risk,1
Im a gastric bypass patient. Ever since surgery I always suffer of dumping syndrome and everything I eat makes me nausea...by the way I love my surgery will but that's the side effect I have to deal with. but anyway ZOFRAN HAS BEEN THE BEST MEDICATION INVENTED IN THE MARKET.....,5
it works well,5
"I have been nauseated without vomiting from post-concussion syndrome, and this drug made such a difference. The nausea was greatly reduced but some side effects are also uncomfortable such as blurry vision, and stomach cramping pains. Also, the pharmacy never told me to let it dissolve on my tongue - I found out by reading about it after it didn't seem to be working. If you are miserable with nausea, it is worth the side effects to stop the nausea. ",4
"My Dr is treating me with Zofran after an extended period of nausea, probably caused by a medication. Within three hours of taking my first pill, the nausea was gone. I was thrilled. After 5 pills I am eating again, with no side effects. I cannot drop the offending medication and my use of Zophran will be limited, but it is such a relief to sit down to a meal and stay out of bed. I'm taking one good day at a time. Wow.",5
"i am on this for not being able to eat without severe nausea or vomiting. This works right away, and I noticed when the 8 hours are up, I get immediately sick. I am hopeful this will help while they figure out what the problem is",4
"I went to the ER due to violent dryheaving, diarrhea, shakiness, and obviously severe nausea. I was given Zofran through an IV and it worked well. The prognosis was either I ate something bad or I had the stomach flu. All my labs came out OK so that was their best guess. I was discharged and given a prescription for the Zofran. I received 8 under-the-tongue pills and it cost just under $8. I have mediocre health insurance so I was relieved that they weren't terribly expensive. The pills dissolve quickly and I got relief within minutes. I read other comments about people getting headaches. I did get a migraine, but I get at least one a week anyway so it's hard to tell if it was from the Zofran or just one of my regular weekly visitors. I'll take the headache over the nausea any day. The only con I've seen is that my instructions say to take one every 8 hours, but the nausea is coming back more quickly than that.",5
"The best medication I've ever taken. It works wonderfully and I have no side effects other than the no nausea, which makes me very happy. I have been taking it for a year after I had serious intestinal and colon surgery. Some days I do onto need it and others I may need it up to three times a day, still learning which foods my intestines and tummy do not like ",5
I first took Zofran when I was a cancer patient. Having had cancer twice n chemo both times I was never sick.  I do a lot of sailing n when in rough seas I take Zofran. I can get right to the point of actually  being sick pop a Zofran and it's an instantaneous fix.,5
QA test Live Review for DB 2008k update!,1
This was the best medication for me.  Suffered for months with nausea and vomiting.  Test being done now to find out why. Problem is insurance has now limited the drug zofran to only 9 pills a month. My Doctor doesn't understand it either.  I was looking for a reason on here.  I had no side affects.  I was finally nausea free. Now I am 9 out of 30 days.,5
test review,5
"I have severe IBS and am nauseous at least once a day.  Sometimes, the nausea gets so bad I feel like I am going to throw up.  It has become debilitating.  My doctor prescribed Zofran for those time and I'll tell you, this drug is a God send!!  Within 20 minutes I feel totally fine and sometimes even hungry!  A lot of people have trouble with the constipation that comes with it, but since I have IBS-D, it has actually regulated me.  One Zofran will keep me ""regular"" all week, which has been an answer to my prayers.",5
"I take this whenever I have terrible nausea due to some GI problems I've been having over the last year (might I add, it works wonderfully with nausea caused by hangovers). I instantly start to feel better and within 20-30 minutes the nausea is gone. Half of the time I get a terrible headache, but other times I do not (can't really determine why). I definitely feel a little light headed within the first couple hours of medication, so I recommend you don't drive or have anything physically demanding to do while taking this. You will feel exhausted. But I rather feel sleepy than feel nauseous any day! I have the pill form and the only think I dislike is that when you're nauseous, the last thing you want to do is swallow something. So trying not to gag while taking it is a task, but within minutes you have relief. Strongly recommend this!",5
"I have severe meniere's disease, which is an ear problem, nausea dizziness and vomiting, can happen completely out of the blue, or with warnings. Many ENT's have found that Zofran is an extremely effective way to reduce the effect or length of a meniere's attack. Usually 4mg to 8mg of the disintegrating tablet under tounge, and thirty or forty minutes of dark quiet, and I can be back on my feet and working.  It has been so efective, that our work clinic now has some on hand for others who get migranes or flu and are nauseous. Glad I don't need it for its original intent, but super glad it exisists. has made me feel normal again!",5
"This medication has caused dizziness,excess drowsiness, stomach pain and watery stools. It has caused my heart to pound.  I had to stop taking it and will call my doctor for another anti-nausea medication. This medication is NOT for everyone, be very careful of it.",1
"Following gall bladder surgery, I had severe nausea and vomiting. Could not keep down any  food or meds. ER administered Zofran via IV. Felt better immediately. Continued oral Zofran for several months with no side effects. ",5
"I get a monthly infusion of Orencia for psoriatic arthritis.  I was experiencing some nausea with it so they gave me Zofran in my IV 30 mins before my orencia.  It worked great for what it was meant to do...I had no nausea and was fully functioning, could drive myself to & from my appointments. But it has one huge side effect from me that is worse than just suffering the nausea.  Severe constipation like nothing I have ever experienced before...so severe that I had to call my husband home and have him pick up an enema on the way.  Thank God that it was a sunday and not a work day!!!  You may think you will be fine with it but take extreme caution if you take this medicine and take a laxative of some kind.  I eat 20-30 mg of fiber everyday. Either oatmeal or fiber bars for breakfast, veggies at lunch, apple after the gym, couple more veggies in the evening and whole grain everything.  And I still had serious problems.  I will never take this again if at all possible to avoid it.",5
"I just started a new chemo medicine and was suppose to take Zofran for the 3 days after each weekly infusion.  This drug made me extremely dizzy, out of breath, restless so much so that I could not work for the 3 days I took it.",3
"Been having recurring bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting. Down 60 lbs. in 3 months from the nausea and being unable to keep anything down. Started Zofran yesterday, 4 MG ever 6 hours. Today I am actually hungry and have been able to keep light food down. What a Godsend this drug is! And absolutely zero side effects, so far anyway. Give this serious consideration if you are suffering from nausea, I'm sure glad I did!",5
"I can not sleep, caused me to weeze because I have asthma, feels as though my herat beets to fast.",2
"I'm an 80-yr-old woman.  I've had previous vomiting on the operating table while asleep!  This time (during my functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) the anesthesiologist gave me Odansetron 4 mg IV in my normal saline, which prevented vomiting both during and after surgery!  Now I have no more fear of aspiration pneumonia (or of stopping breathing during surgery).  I didn't need any of this medication after surgery.   I'm telling my friends about this.  ",5
Was given IV Therapy for many weeks in the Hospital and Out. Had gotten very sick and the Zofran helped alot with the vomiting and sickness too my stomach I had daily.,4
i am taking this for relief from chemo. it is a wonderful drug. I would highly recomend this drug for nausa and vomiting.,5
"With my first child I was severly sick. Vomiting day and night, could not keep anything down for 7 months. This product helped me and my son. Now that I am 6 weeks pregnant with my second child I am having some of the same problems. But I am taking my zofran in the morning and it helps 80% of the time. Still a little nauseated and weak but Im able to go to work and function. ",5

I had to go the the ER because I couldn't eat anything and felt very dehydrated. The day before I was given phenergan and cipro by my family doctor for a bladder infection. The phenergan didn't work at all so the ER gave me Zofran in my IV and prescribed it for me when I got out. It works wonders. For weeks I was taking antacids like candy because of the nausea. Now I'm actually hungry and able to eat.,5
"This is my third pregnancy, I am about 9 weeks, and I had severe morning sickness with all three but this is the first time I looked for something to help me with it because this is the first time I have had a job while pregnant. After the first dose I felt 80% better. Slight nausea here and there but no urge to vomit anymore. I have only taken two doses so tomorrow morning will be the ultimate test since as soon as I pop my eyes open I find myself running to the bathroom. Fingers crossed.",5
my 5 year old suffers migraines that bring extreme nausea nothing stayed down until until zofran. just 15 mins later shes taking motrin and drinking fluids. love it,5
"This medication works wonders for nausea. I take when I start feeling nauseous and that's when I normally take it. After about twenty minutes the nausea is gone, like it never occurred in the first place.",5
"I have taken Zofran with all 3 of my pregnancies. I am currently 11 weeks pregnant with baby #3 and was diagnosed last week with full-blown Hyperemesis. I am on a higher dosage this time (8mg 3-4 times a day, rather than 4mg), and I am taking the orally dissolving tablets rather than the kind you swallow. It is working well so far, but I am also having headaches as a side effect, and constipation. The constipation, however, is not as bad as it was with my previous two pregnancies. There is no way I could function without this medication, and to me the side effects are small potatoes compared to the alternative. Previously I was camped out on the bathroom floor, vomiting so much that my throat was bleeding.",4
This is by far the best medicine for my chronic nausea. Works well every time with no complications so far.,4
I'm having terrible constipation. I've been taking stool softeners for 2 weeks.,3
"I have been battling with an infection inside my stomach; I would go days without eating because everything I ate caused me to vomit. I was put in the hospital twice from dehydration, and I missed so much work. The nausea was beyond unbearable. The doctor put me on zofran to last me until they finish running all the tests on me to figure out what is wrong. The nausea and vomiting stopped immediately. I still have to watch what I eat until they figure out what’s wrong, but at least I can eat. My only complaint is that the medicine causes constipation, I haven’t had a bowel movement in 6 days. I am just grateful that I am able to function now though. I give it two thumbs up!",5

I call this the miracle drug.I have tried so many different medications for nausea and nothing has worked like zofran.,5
"This medicine did help with the severe nausea I had, but beware of it if you get migraines. One pill caused a migraine that lasted for 3 days. I decided I would rather have the nausea than the migraine so I stopped using it.",3
"My doctor prescribed this immediately after I told her my nausea had progressed to vomiting at 8 weeks. I do not vomit easily so although it doesn't sound as bad as the other reviewers, the nausea really was severe. I was living on ginger ale and saltines and now I can eat real food and get through the workday in some comfort!",5
I have only had anesthesia 3 times. The last two times they gave me Zofran somewhere along the line. I didn't have any nausea afterwards.,5

"I have been on pain meds for 5 years now and have always had horrible nausea and 9 times out of ten I throw up after taking them. I have tried Phenegran and a few other anti-nausea meds with little or no relief. The very first dose of zofran I took helped amazingly! No more nausea and no more vomiting!! This is truly a miracle drug (at least for me anyway). I haven't had ANY side effects. The only down side is that it is very expensive. Luckily I have insurance, so it only cost me 6 dollars for 6 pills (generic).",5
I have take Zofran for all 3 pregnancies...Ended up in hospital this time even with taking Zofran (for dehydration and vomiting).  Doctor ordered home health and Zofran by SubQ - I had a 24 hour pump that delivered a constant dose throughout the day.  It was the ONLY thing that helped me.  Without my pump I would still be so sick.  ,4
stopped my morning nausea completely,5
Zofran was taken in the Chemo IV and worked great to prevent nausea. Took the pill for several days after each chemo cycle as a followup as I experienced nausea and Zofran made life better. Experienced some headache with the first use but as the weeks continued no additional side effects.  Three months later I had started radiation and per my doctor suggestion to use Zofran for possible nausea I found that I was experiencing constipation and some dizziness. After the first week I stopped taking the pill and discovered no further problems.  Overall very satisfied.,5
"Had the worst nausea hit me 5 weeks in, nothing over the counter worked for me.  Started taking this and boom- no more nausea! wonder drug! Took it my entire pregnancy and had no more nausea, unless I missed a dose by accident.  Keep taking at same times everyday and you won't have this problem.  Little did I know that I would be taking this same drug a year later for cancer treatment. Very powerful stuff, and it works!",5
"took this drug to help with my chemo side effects of nausea and vomiting, and it worked wonders!  As long as I took this drug on schedule my nausea was well controlled, at most times non existent.  I had 8 rounds of 4 hour chemo, so this really helped.",5
"It is reallt nasty and you hae to produce saliva, if you don't rinse out you mouth with water first.  It does work really fast though.",5
"My 7 year old son was given Zofran to calm his stomach. It worked great. After the second dose, taken 8 hours later, he developed a raised rash running up the sides of his neck, up the base of his skull and an area on his side. He also complained of neck stiffness and pain. After giving him Singulair, the rash subsided and Motrin took care of the pain.",5
"After being severely nauseated and vomiting daily since I had gotten pregnant, which is now our 7th week,I couldn't take it ant more. I've just started the generic Zofran. I was sick daily, now it's managed, thanks to this medication.",4
This drug works way better than any other nausea medicine I have taken. I haven't experienced any of the side effects others have.,5
i can't truely write much i've taken one pill so for i'm trying it between carafate and this Zolfran ,4
"I took zofran and it's generic form, 3 of my 4 pregnancies. I usually fell ill at week 5, starting the drug by week 6. Initially, it minimized the nausea, but by week 8, it was no match for the surging hormones that made me miserable. I found it adequate for taking of the ""edge,"" but not a total solution for any woman with hyperemisis. To ward off the constipation associated with this drug, Miralax works quite well. I recommend drinking it with your favorite juice.",3
"Needed strong relief from pain medication withdrawal and the first drug tried didn't work but the Zofran worked immediately and I experienced blissful relief, HOWEVER, the headache has lasted several days. Mild, but gee, painfree is where I want to be!!! Oh and drug free too!",5
"I am one of the unlucky ones who has been feeling sick my entire pregnancy.  When I first started the zofran it worked wonders, but a month in it stopped working as well. To remedy the situation I would take the pill about an hour before I had to get up out of bed. I would try to sleep to let it kick in, otherwise the pill and whatever in my stomach would come back up.  It has been so wonderful to take this medicine.  Consitpation in the beginning was pretty bad, but as I progressed through my pregnancy I only have to take half a pill in the early morning and I'm good.",5
"The medicine helped my nausea some, but I was so constipated for like two days after taking one dose.  Terrible experience!",2
I have Crohn's Disease and would not be able to function without this drug.  I would be nauseous 100% of the time without it.  It also helps in regulating me as well.  ,5
Just got over some kind of bug...3 days of vomiting and 10..yes I said 10...diarrhea!!!  Doctor says its viral not bacterial.  Yogurt helped.  The Zofran also worked well.  My nausea was soooo bad..dry  heaves and all!!!  It worked quick!!,5
"i have been in and out of the hospital for the same condition over and over. Dr.s kept saying I have this and that and finally I said can I just get something for the pain and nausea, and I'll be on my way!!! They gave me Zofran, and I felt awesome, Ten years of having all sorts of conditions and no answers, finally something to ease the nausea. If you take this drug when absolutely need to, it works seriously! Saves you money on gas to the ER, and your sanity, because the just don't know what you have.. ",5
"Zofran takes away my nausea really well, but it gives me such unbearable constipation.  I try not to use it due to that, yet I need it to make it through the work day.",5
nausea,4
"I was prescribed Zofran to take with a potent antibiotic which has a common side effect of upset stomach and nausea.  I am the poster child for stomach side effects caused by medication.  First time I took both and immediately starting feeling nausea.  This continued for 2 days so I consulted with WebMD and learned from other reviews that Zofran was causing nausea.  I stopped taking the Zofran and started feeling better.  Net, the Zofran made me feel worse/nauseated, than not.",1
"My 10 yr old daughter was extremely sick. Doctor gave her this medication and within hrs, she stopped vomiting. I was told this medication was very expensive, but I paid $14.60 for 16 tablets, best money I have ever spent on medications!",5
"I started vomiting at week 7 and started taking the generic form of Zofran. At first it worked but by weeks 8/9, I was still vomiting while on the meds and the consitpation and bloating was unbareable. So I decided to stop taking the meds and went from vomiting 3 times a day to 1x a day (or a few days without vomiting). And after 1 week of pune juice (yuck!), the consitpation eased up. ",3
"I took this medication in the morning before I got out of bed, and the nause whent away less than 10 min.",5
My 6 year old was given this med. at the ER for extreme nausea and vomiting that had him very dehydrated. He had no nausea or vomiting after the first 2 or 3 hours after starting the meds. ,5
"I was given this medication via IV in ER for severe stomach flu, vomiting.  From the initial dose to two follow up oral doses, I experienced the most vicious headache of my life, numbness in hands and legs, vomiting, blurred vision, low heart rate.  Had to go to emergency room again, thought I was having a stroke.  Turns out, ""deadly allergic reaction to Zofran"".  ",1
It made me more nauseated.,2
"My midwife 1st put me on reglan, which i'm glad it didn't work because of the lawsuits of health problem(tardive dyskinesia)then another rx didn't work- and finally a friend nurse told me about Zofran this rx really worked for me no more nausea and vomiting ( gaining weight) I'm just afraid that one of these days I'll hear about a lawsuit for health problems with Zofran rx also --*** All I can do is pray for my baby and I to stay healthy with no long-term side effects***",4
the first ont thatreally works for me!,5
I have a lot of stomach/bowel issues that leave me pretty nauseated at times. I keep it with me always because I never know how I am going to feel. It works almost immediately after I take it and lasts a long time. I would recommend it to anyone. It's like a miracle drug to me because I would take any other sickness before being nautious...it's the worst feeling! Good luck!,5
"I took this medicine in a different form with my first child in 2003. I am taking the 8 mg ODT tabs now. I do NOT remember this constipation problem before! Also, it does not work as long as the 8 hr. dose frequency. I am wondering if the difference in the previous wonderful experience and this constipation pain could be from the dosing? I thought I was on a 4-6 hr. dose frequency previously, but it was a long time ago. I don't remember having problems still being nausous either. Does anyone have any info on this?",5
"i want to know if thiis is a psychotic medicine they have an adverse reaction on me.i was overwelmed and cut off all my hair the other day.does it give me mood swings? im on phentonol patch,diazipam,norco,ibprophen..plz respond to me TO [email protected] 708 563 1827 ty",5
"I had 7 migraines in the last 10 days, extremely constipated, stomach ache, dizzy.",5
"I was given zofran to prevent nausea in relation to an unidentified stomach or intestinal problem.  It eliminated all signs of nausea.  The only side effect I suffered from, and the cause of my discontinued use, was immense headaches.  I was given phenegren instead, which has its own share of side effects, including drowsiness and double vision, but no additional pain.",5
"it is absolutely incredibly ludicrous, that these insurance co.'s AND DRUG STORE CHAINS CVS IN PARTICULAR Can charge these patients outrageous prices,""six pills just 6 small pills""FOR ONE HUNDRED SIX DOLLARS AND 50 CENTS. i HOPE THAT THIS NEW HEALTH CARE BILL THAT GETS PASSED CUTS THE TESTICLES OFF OF THESE SLIME BALL COMPANY'S frustrated and angry",1
When I was younger I had a lot of stomach issues. We  went through every pill known to man to help and none did. They decided to try this and it worked. This pill is the only thing I was able to take and not end up in the hospital due to dehyrdration. I absolutely love it. Now that I am pregnant the moment that I start getting to where I cannot control my vomiting I take one and I am better in an hour or so. It is an awesome pill and I am so thankful that my doctor perscribed it to me when I was younger.,5
"Currently 12 weeks pregnant and have been taking generic zofran as needed for a few weeks. It works very quickly and lasts. I find that I do not need to take it as often as is acceptable because it is still working up to a day after any given dose. My doc did not have me try any other medicines first because the others cause sleepiness and that just wouldnt work with my job. Even though it has been approved by my doctor, I am still very cautious about taking it and do not unless I feel like I cant continue my day without some assistance. ",5
Have been throwing up since six weeks pregnant (hyperemesis) Now am 11 weeks pregnant have tried reglan and phenergan and they did not work at all except to make it worse. Have been hospitalized 3 times and each time they give me zofran iv and i feel human again almost immediately! I just wish my insurance would cover the pill form because even the generic is 10$ a pill and i take 4 a day extremely unaffordable without insurance guess i will just have to keep going to the hospital because they do cover the iv. This is definetly a miracle drug to stop my nausea!,4
"I have Crohn's Disease so I take 6mp (a cancer drug) which causes me to become nausea a lot and vomit.  I have been given reglan in the past but it causes a rare reaction in me causing me to not be able to sit, and have suidical thoughts.  Then I was given this drug and it is TRULY a miracle!  I use to vomit 3 to 4 times a week and now i only vomit 2 to 3 times a month.",5
"Because I am taking a medication for  fibromyalgia, I get neauseated.  My doctor recommended and prescribed  this medication.  I am thrilled with the result.  Perhaps others might learn from this; however, keep in mind one person's reaction to a certain medication may not be the same as someone else.",5
"I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis. The first Rx my doctor prescribed, Protonix did not work for me. Besides, my Rx Insurance did not cover it. Zofran (ondansetron) works for me. But my doctor is concerned with long term usage due to possible neurology side effects in long term use. The doctor recommended me to see a neurologist, but I am still yet to do so. It's only been a few months. I plan to follow up as recommended. ",4
"I took this medication for nausea after surgery, it really helped with the nausea but I stayed really light headed and passed out once, I also broke out with a rash all over my face.  ",3
I dont feel any side effects,5
"I have been suffering from a combination of tension and migraine headaches, always accompanied by nausea. I have tried phenergan and it helps but causes severe sleepiness. I was unable to work and take it. The zofran helps almost instantly and has no side effects. I recommed anyone suffering from nausea to try it!",5
"I am taking this medication to counteract the near-constant nausea caused by my anti-convulsant medications.  It seems to work but has some side effects of its own, mostly constipation.  ",3
"Zofran became my best friend with my last pregnancy! I used the orally disintegrating tablet, it was so easy & worked fast. In my two pregnancies before this last one I used phenergan & it made me want to sleep all the time, but I continued to take it because I would rather put up with the tiredness than the vomitting. Although w/ the majority of pregnancies, nausea & vomitting ends after the 1st trimester, mine didn't! With all three of my pregnancies I was severely ill through out the entire nine months of each one. When my OB gave me Zofran with my last pregnancy I wanted to kiss her...LOL! It was such a god-send. I could actually function on a normal level without having to run the the restroom to vomit numerous times as day. I will admit the taste of it is pretty nasty but I just learned to hold my breath for those few seconds it took to melt & swallowed it down with some water, & that was it. I think the key to getting it to work the fastest in pregnancy so you don't vomit is to keep it next to your bed with a glass of water & take it as soon as you wake up in the morning. That worked the best for me, I would take it before I even got out of the bed because I knew, if I didn't, as soon as I would stand up I would have to make a run for the restroom to vomit.",5
Ihave been taking zofran since i was 8 weeks pregnant i am now 17 weeks pregnant and with out this medication i don't think i could survive a day with out vomitting all day and feeling miserable. it does work wonders but is very expensive.,5
i am 6 months pegnant and throw up every time i eat my doctor gave itr to me today and i was able to eat and keep it down .made my throat very dry though. also made me hyper.also gve nme reglan which works awesome too would definitly recmmend .and i got the generics .,5
"This medicine has worked really well for me.  I am 10 weeks pregnant and have had severe morning sickness since about week 6.  I tried taking Reglan and Phenergan at first.  Neither worked.  After being hospitalized for dehydration around 8 weeks, my doctor gave me Zofran.  I still feel a bit nauseaus at times, but nothing like I was.  I can actually eat some things and drink.  This drug has worked very well!",5
"I got the generic of Zofran, which without insurance would have been $85, I only paid $4! I think that it works very well and so far have had no side effects! Also I usually only have to take one when I am feeling sick to my stomach and it works within a half hour.",4
Zofran has been a wonder drug for me.  I have crohns disease and I also take an anti-depressant that was making me nauseous.  I tried Compazine and that didn't work as well as Zofran.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who has any nausea.  My only complaint about the drug is that it makes me a little sleepy but that only last a little while.,5
"I had to take this medication due to severe vomiting because of problems with my gallbladder while I waited to have surgery.  It has been giving me headaches where my head feels like it weighs a ton, but overall, I would take the headache pain over having nausea any day!  You need to have excellent insurance for this medication.  It runs approximately $475 for a weeks worth.  But totally worth it!",5
"I had been very nauseated since started having significant pelvic pain from an ovarian cyst. I'd taken phenergan before, but my doc suggested trying Zofran, since it doesn't make you as sleepy.  (And I needed to function at work). I'd given it in IV form where I work (nurse), but not the oral form of it. What a difference!  No nausea.  Not sleepy. No side effects--yet anyway. And my insurance covered it!!!  I would redomment it to anyone with nausea....no matter the cause!",5
I have severe nausea with my third pregnancy without vomit.  This drug eased my nausea but the severe constipation and stomach cramps were worse than the original nausea!  I ended up with more nausea because my digestive system was so backed up!  The label only indicated headaches so only through research did I discover the drug as the source of my problem.  ,3
This drug workeed great for my excessive vomiting in pregnancy.  I totally agree that you must have insurance to get this.  I do not have prescription coverage and 20 pills cost $263.00.  Totally worth it!!,5
"This medication was very effective at ceasing my nausea due to pregnancy. And, this medication has recently been made generic! So, it is definitely affordable to anyone now.",4
During my first Trimester I was unable to keep any food down and this medication helped so much.  ,4
On constant narcotic medications and this along with phenagren are the only anti nausea meds that work.  Headaches do occur.......usually mild though.,5
Works very well.,4
"My daughter, 2 yrs old, suffered froma severe case of Rotavirus and couldn't keep anything down, liquid or solid, for two days. We got the liquid form of this medication and it has been a Godsend! Need very good insurance though, without it would've cost us $650 for a small bottle.",5
"I took Zofran to control the nausea/vomiting that was brought on by percocet following minor outpatient surgery. It was a godsend!! It reduced my nausea by 80% & stopped the vomiting completely. However, you'd better have good insurance because without it, my 5 pill prescription would have been $132!!",4
I had to use this during my second pregnancy after trying bothe phenergan and Tigan.  Zofran was the only thing that kept the food down. I just wish it didn't cost so much,5
This drug was recommended to me by a friend. I had severe morning sickness with my first two pregnancies and now pregant for the third time and sick again. I was not doing well taking care of two older kids and working full time. I tried Phenergan at first and did nothing for me. Zofran has worked great. I take it twice a day and have not thrown up since taking it and can actually function at work. I am very tired at the end of the day but that's a side effect of pregnancy not the drug :),5
"I recently became severely allergic to phenergan while in the hospital for ulcers.   While recovering, I have had to continue taking medicine occasionally to keep my nausea under control. This has been the only anti-nausea medicine to work for me so far. Although, Zofran cause TERRIBLE headaches in my experience. I'm not sure if I would prefer the extreme nausea or the almost unbearable headaches.",5
I have panic attacks where I get extremely nauseous and thought that I was just really sick. I would take a Zofran and in 5 minutes I was feeling just fine and able to get back to sleep. This medication is a godsend.,5
"Zofran worked well with no side effects for excessive vomiting during pregancy.  The generic form did not work as well.  Zofran was also used 5 years later for nausea caused by strong antibiotics.  It had no side effects, like those associated with phenergan, which can make patients lethargic.",5
"I have used Zofran now for several years to treat nausea becuase of taking so many other drugs. ie, pain killers and mussel relaxers whcih upset the stomache. Zofran has been a life saver it works with in about 10 minutes and even works on the flu!",5
Why didn't I ask for something to ease this horrible nausea ealier?!?!???  I took one immediately upon leaving the pharmacy and within 5 minutes I felt better.  I haven't had any side effects and I can now get off the couch and take care of my other kids.,5
The generic version did not work when I was pregnant.  I know of other women who had the same issue.,3
took an act of congress almost to get insurance to pay for it but it works better than anything else i've taken for nausea and vomiting,4
I love this drug as it won't cause as much sedation as other drugs like Tigan. Very clean and almost NO side effects,4
"If it were not for Zofran, I would be throwing up right now! My doctor had to ask the medical board of my insurance company to approve this for me! It is very expensive and the only thing that has allowed me to hold down any food! I am so thankful for this drug!",5
"found out i was 6 weeks pregnant on the 2nd day of my honeymoon. throwing up constantly.. more thant 3 times an hour, went to an urgent care and they gave me iv Zofran and a prescription.. i didn't throw up again the rest of the trip, however, i have had to continue taking the medication and i'm currently 16 weeks pregnant.. and when i stop taking the meds for a day, the nausea and vomiting immediately return.. it hasn't made me feel like my pre pregnant self, but it has made what was a severely debilitating condition tolerable, so at least i can keep food and liquids in.. my only complaint is that this medicine is SOOOOOOO very expensive and we don't have insurance.. but i have to have it to be able to half way function in my daily life.. i would definitely reccomed this to women with severe nausea and vomiting. ",4
"I am 7 weeks preg with my first baby and I NEVER thought I would be soooo nausea.  It was soooo hard to be at work with the feeling of needing to throw up every second. I started taking Zofran that my doctor prescribed me and it made a WORLD of difference. I DEFINITLEY recommend this medicine for anyone who has morning sickness. I still have the other symptoms such as tired, peeing every 30 min and being in bed by 9:30 every night, but I can deal with that. So far I have not had any side effects. (knock on wood)  ; )",5
"This drug has been a wonderful wonderful thing.  However, it commonly causes severe constipation, which is difficult to deal with. Highly recommend if you're sick every day and cannot get through life otherwise!  It's amazing.  ",5
I have extreme nausea and this has not helped at all!! Very disappointed and yet sad that im still suffering,1
"I highly recommend this medication based on my results. Without it I would be vomiting all day (hyperemesis) malnourished and dehydrated. My past pregnancies I used Atarax/Reglan/Phenergan all with a drowsy/sleepy/very sesitive to odors effect and I also continued to be sick occasionally. Taking Zofran allows me to basically continue my everyday schedule including work without feeling sleepy or drowsy. Sometimes I feel queasy or a little gassy, but it is tolerable. It has made being pregnant enjoyable rather than miserable.",5
"It helped some what, it made me at least be able to keep food and water down. But i still felt nausea.",3
About 3 hours into taking Zofran and what a difference!!!!!!  I went from completely miserable and unable to function at work due to my nausea...and now I am back to my normal self!,5
"TAking this to prevent nausea from other drugs, I've controlled the nausea but I'm experiencing extreme constipation.",4
"with my first child I was miserable my entire 1st trimester.  Now with  my second child, the nausea was just as bad.  Once I began using Zofran (1/2 tablet) the nausea stopped completely. HOORAY.",5
"I am breastfeeding and became sick with the stomach flu(which I recieved from my child). I was unable to keep anything down and was placed on this drug.  My milk has decreased significantly, not sure if this is related to the sickness or the Zofran.  ",5
DID NOT HELP ME AT ALL. I WAS FEELING MORE MISERABLE AFTER TAKING THIS DRUG.,1
"This works really well without tiredness, but isn't covered by my insurance. Very expensive. ",5
My body does not like to vomit so instead it holds it in and makes me miserable all day. This medicine is a miracle drug!!  Without it there is no way I could eat a thing.,5
"I vomited every day of my pregnancy. At least with Zofran, i could wake up, throw up once, take the Zofran, and feel OK the rest of the day. When I was able to get some through insurance (which was very difficult since it was not an approved drug), It made working possible. I would have been hospitalized for dehydration and insufficient weight gain for the majority of my pregnancy if it weren't for Zofran. ",5
"This medicine has allowed me to continue working during pregnancy.  It has caused me excessive gas and stomach cramps.  However, I can continue to work with those conditions vs. the constant vomitting and nauseaness. ",4
"I went into the ER on my 4th day of vomiting, nausea and weakness. This was put in my IV. I immediately felt better although within 10 minutes I started feeling very cold and started randomly coughing and my chest started feeling tight. Within minutes of the first sign of feeling cold I was ghasping for breath and my husband was calling the nurses for help. I somehow could breathe in but couldn't breathe out so I was gulping breaths? I've never had an allergic reaction like that before so it was a bit scary. I left the ER a few hours later and felt like my whole body ran a marathon. I was exhausted.",5
"I was given Zofran IV to attempt to stop uncontrollable nausea and vomiting related to inner ear issue and pressure changes of flying.  It had no effect; I was still vomiting off the gurney until they changed to phenergan, which was effective (although the combination of the two drugs together had some unpleasant perceptual side effects until the Zofran wore off).  Recently, my mother had colon surgery, and was given Zofran to prevent nausea/vomiting after the surgery.  Again for her, this had no (or very little) effect; she was still extremely nauseated and they had to change the medication.  I suspect that some people--perhaps running in families--simply do not respond as is typical for this medication.  ",1
"I take this medication to help with chronic nausea due to malabsorption syndrome, which resulted from nerve damage to my GI tract. It works so well and is the least sedating of anti-nausea meds I've ever had.",5
"Very painful and scary. Started immediately after injection in IV. Funny taste in mouth, mouth started burning, nose and face started burning, rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, burning from top of head to feet, turned fire engine red, uncontrollable muscle movement, nose and ears were throbbing, then I started having goosebumps and chilling. Doctor ordered Benadryl iv and not sure how long it was before it started helping, but it worked. Would like some idea what ingredient in RX caused this? Sulfa drugs make me throw up and Tylox makes me feel like I'm having an out of body experience. Other than that I've never had a reaction to anything, but I don't take a lot of Rx's. Lisinopril and Estradiol on a daily basis. Any suggestions as to what else I should avoid besides ZOFRAN?",1
"Worked immediatly after surgery, but wore off quickly. Started experiencing nausea 14 hours after tooth removal surgery. Although I have a sensitive stomach, this hasn't happened in any of my past 4 surgeries including a different tooth removal surgery where they took out twice as many teeth. Overall pretty affective, I still haven't experienced any vomiting. Nasea possibly due to liquid diet change, I would reccomend this drug for surgeries. ",4
It immediately stopped my vomiting and the nausea.  Wonderful drug for me. ,5
"I was given this medication IV for pre-sedation for a procedure to prevent nausea afterward.  Did not work and developed joint pain, stomach pain and right side pain afterward.  Joint pain still remains 2 weeks after.",1
This was given as an IV to help with nausea for pain meds... i had a severe allergic reaction....,1
I was given Zofran IV in the ER of my local hospital (which I consider state-of-the-art and I am also an RN (that said for informatory purposes only)).  This drug had absolutely no effect on my nausea and vomiting. The RN who gave it to me assured me that it was used alot and that symptoms usually subsided within ten minutes.  I found this not to be the case at all. ,1
Maximum dose in 24 hours,3
"Although I did not have much nausea, I had resultant lack of peristalsis, causing an ileus for up to four days after chemo  administration, with horrible distention relieved only with enemas and laxatives, a clear liquid diet and application of heat to the abdomen. Very misreable experience, indeed!!!   I choose to not have the pre-medication of Zofran with my subsequent  chemo tx, feeling I would rather experience the vomiting and diarrhea than the above listed symptoms!!  I had a Rx for compazine at home.",3
I was sent to the ER after my vomiting wouldnt stop after I was told that this was only a side effect from another medication. Come to find out I had a Pottasium defficiency which was making me to feel as though I was burning up and very shaky and nausea. I am so glad I was given this in the ER immediatly stopped my vomiting literally within 1-2 minutes.,5
I am pregnant and the first 3 weeks of my pregnancy i was vomiting almost everything i ate. Week 4 i started the zofran and i have vomited 1 time since thats only because i forgot to take the zofran. It's wonderful!!!! ,5
I was given this when I was in the hospital for a really really bad migraine headache and having really bad nausea from the pain meds and migraine. It worked wonders! I was also given it when after I had my appendix out. It worked GREAT both times. I would highly reccommend it!,5
I tried this medicine during a short stay at the hospital for extreme vomiting and I must say it works wonders!!  I highly recommend.,5
Had a severe allergic reation upon adminstration of the drug.  Arm immediately turned red and veins started swelling as well as intense burning pain.  4 weeks later I still have a bruise and pain from the IV location.,1
"This drug works when given prior to the start of vomiting, to prevent vomiting.  Does not have very good results given post vomiting.",5
I was given this drug on an ambulance for vomiting it stopped my vomiting within 1-2 min. It was wonderful.,5
"This drug was given to me when I was in the E.R. because I was vomiting, I had the flu.  It did absolutly NOTHING for me.",1
"I have a type of cancer and have been nauseated for quite some time.  I'm trying Zofran, and so far, not helping much at all.",2
"I should have read label, I have QT syndrome and it caused arrythmia, i passed out, it has been awful and that was two days ago. my chest is tight, dizzy, vision problems, nervous. Never again. only took it twice",3
"I received this medicine after a severe bout of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  I first received the medicine in the emergency room, via IV, and then received it to use at home.  The medicines affect was immediate and I felt relief from the nausea right away.  No side effects to report.  thank you makes of ZOFRAN",4
Gave me major headaches I rarely get a headache.  ,3
This drug was given to my daughter for uncontrolled vomiting due to severe gastroenteritis. It was the only relief at the moment. Thank you so much for making her comfort. ,5
"I ended up in the emergency room due to not being able to keep anything down, causing extreme dehydration. After being hooked up to an IV for several hours, they released me and gave me this. Worked like a charm, and also has a pleasant taste.",5
"I was given this drug to prevent sea sickness on a cruise. Seven days at sea, one very rough day, no vomiting or nausea for me. This worked great.",5
Works great but caused an unsettling degree of dizziness.,5
Works great but causes me unsettling dizziness.,5
I am having a bout with sinusitis and it has been quite painful.  The medicine has made me quite nauseous and I tried Zofran to calm my stomach which worked perfectly. I was able to keep down a bit of soup which made me feel better and the pain relievers have not since made me nauseous.,5
taken after surgey,4
"After I had a Mallory Weise tear, I was a high risk tearing again if I kept vomiting, because I was so nasueas, this was the only drug that worked.  Dr tried Reglan, had many many anxiety attacks from that.  Promethazine made me basically narcoleptic.  This is the only one I take now.  I take 4 8mg a day.  Saved me!",5
"This has been the most effective drug ever for me, I have taken them all. However, it is very expensive.  ",5
"I have no history of heart problems and i had a very frightening adverse side effect which is listed as ""Rare Side Effect"" during surgery- Heart problems which required a shot to my chest to slow my heart rate back to normal- according to my doctors this side effect is common with this drug for anyone who generally gets a rapid heart beat from products with Pseudoephedrine such as Sudafed. So please take care to mention this sensitivity to your doctor prior to surgery!!",1
My 4 year old son caught a stomach virus and was vomiting every 45 minutes for about 12 hours before we were seen by our peditrician. It took only one dissolvable tablet which was so easy for a little to take. No more vomiting. It worked like charm. His fever broke about 14 hours after that and he hasn't stopped taking and playing yet. Now of course I have come down with the same stomach virus (imagine only having been vomited on about 12 times). I am contiplating taking one of these myself. I read in a couple other parents were even prescibed the medication because the flu often goes through the entire family. I do not take any other medication. Any thoughts out there for me tonight - it is after hours for me to call the doctor. Any thoughts?,5
"Seriously the best medicine ever prescribed for the stomach flu.  I took my daughter to the ER for severe vomiting and the ER Dr. gave her this and within an hour she was a totally different child.  He wrote the RX for more, figuring we would be next in line to get the stomach flu.  Dr. was right. Within 48 hours we both had it also.  We took the pills after vomiting 2-3 times and it worked amazingly. It still took us the usual 2 days to get our strentgh back. This drug is amazing. Thanks to Dr's also, for prescribing the meds.  ",5
Dr. perscribed for daughter's severe vomiting. Only needed to use 1 tablet and after being up all evening and night with her prior to dr. apt. it stopped her vomitting right away and she was finally able to sleep and feel better,5
"I was prescribed 8mg twice daily to stop nausea and vomiting from Gastroparesis.  It tastes like grape flavored vomit.  About half of the time, the sick feeling in my stomach is gone, but the lump in my throat is still there.  It also gave me horrible diarrhea a few times.  Yuck!  I've been taking it for almost a week and I took my last pill this morning.",1
"My 2 young children (age 3 & 6) had a really bad stomache flu.  This was miracle drug for us! No vomiting for 12 hours YEAH! When my husband and I came down with the same flu, we tried it too (with our doctors approval) and it worked. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste, but is wonderful. Even my youngest was able to take it, since it disolves on contact with the tongue. Wish they came out with this drus sooner. I can NOT take other anti-nausea drugs like compazine, tigan and phenergan, due to EPS (dystonic)reactions, so this drug is a god-send.",5
Gave me great relief when nothing else worked during my experience of hyperemesis during pregnancy.  The ODT was very helpful since I couldn't keep down any pills.,4
"I'm on this medication for nausea from another medication (MS Contin). It dissolves quickly, although the ODT don't exactly taste wonderful, it works!  ",4
I lost 15 pounds the first eleven weeks of my pregnancy.  The doctor had prescribed another drug but I couldn't keep it down.  Zofran has eased the nausea and vomiting.  It may cause you to have a headache but it's well worth it!,5
so so,1
"On the expensive side, but worth every penny in effectivness. Saved me from having a miscarriage, I had lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks prior to starting medication!",5
"I have chronic migrianes and one of the worst side-effects is severe nausea.  Before Zofran, I had constant nausea, and at one point I was so sick I went down to 65lbs (I'm 5'2""). Now I give myself daily injections of Zofran, and within 15 minutes my nausea is gone.  I prefer this med to promethazine (because when I inject that, I get welts and bruising aside from it being quite painful). Zofran on the other hand doesn't sting while being administered, and I've never had any know side-effects. It's a life saver.",5
"I was randomly throwing up all day and my doctor immediatly gave me a shot of Zofran. Within ten minutes, I was back to my normal (albeit tired) self. I can go back to work now!",5
"Wasn't able to continue Tamoxifen due to side effects, and wasn't postmenopausal yet. My MD recommended an Aromatase Inhibitor with the Zoladex. I was afraid of some of the side effects listed, but agreed to try. I have been on this regimen for 9 months now. The bone and joint pain and inflammation of tendons is becoming unbearable. Have read lots of journals that describe the long lasting effects due to permanent changes in the brain, basically lowering the pain receptor threshold. I'm worried that I have traded one life altering event for one just as devastating. ",3
"I don’t usually leave reviews but I felt this was important to because there are so many unpleasent experiences written about this drug, but on balance I can honestly say it’s not that bad.  I did not want to take Zoladex after reading up on it, I was very nervous of the side effects and I reluctantly started monthly injections for 4 months in preparation for surgery.  The actual injection it’s self did hurt, but it gets slightly better each month. My first injection left a small bruise but none after that.  It stopped my periods which for me was a huge relief not having to deal with so much pain each month. I didn’t get any side effects for about 3 weeks and I did notice about a week before each injection I was getting a little pain, which soon settled after my injection again.  Side effects - hot flushes, sweaty and hot at night, difficulty falling asleep then tired in the mornings and muscle aches. Which doesn’t sound great but apart from the hot flushes not each of these side effects were daily. Short term it’s annoying but long term if it’s going to help prep for surgery and give you a better surgical result then it’s totally worth it in my opinion.  I suffered no spots (which I was expecting as my skin can be bad) and no weight gain. ",5
"After 6 months of the subcutaneous injection, I (MALE) have severe breast pain and swelling plus my PSA has increased from 2.9 to 7.3 ?  I am not too happy with this drug.",1
"This is my 3rd lot of zolidex, I had it first to control my endo, (19 years old), then before I had a tcre , (26 years) which has now failed after 3 years it's growing back and now on it again whilst I wait for a hystorectomy, (30 years) i do get painfull stiff joints, hair loss and bad hot flushes but wouldn't change that for the pain and bleeding without being on it ??",5
"I think this product should be taken off the market, I first took this product as therapy for prostate cancer. in 2007, neither the VA doctor nor the nurse who administered this offered any info on side effects. long term side effects are this drug had the effect of reducing my testosterone alright by completely eliminating my testicals the source of testosterone, I've been casterated. I have no, nuts, to say it crudely.  I have no body hair and have continusly gained weight over the years, I have no sex drive and I am now impotent and have been since fist administered in 2007, no motivation,no ambition, ""quality of life very bad without testosterone. if I could sue someone I would, did it help with the prostrate cancer? don't know my PSA is <.01 so that's good   ",1
"I am a Vietnam Veteran, I had a PSA of 58.5 and the cancer had spread outside the prsotate. after radiation of 45 days I was put on Zoladex and will be for the rest of my life to control the cancer. I believe this drug has saved my life. I have hot flashes but I can take that to know my cancer is being treated.",5
"I have been taking it for only 5 months. I experienced a few side effects at first, such as nausea and headaches. So far, no other problems has developed.  ",5
"I know Zoladex is an important drug for my hormone receptive cancer but the side effects are terrible.  I don't have much of a memory now, I can't remember short term stuff, my blood pressure has gone so high I am now on BP meds, I have absolutely no sex drive (only in my 40's) and unbelievable hot flushes and up at least 3 times a night.  My hair has really thinned out, and I have aches and pains which are quite terrifying!  But Zoladex is important in hormone receptive breast cancer, just a bummer about the terrible side effects.",4
"trouble sleeping , back & chest pain ,breathlessness, concentration",5
low energy need 1 -2 1 hr naps daily hot and cold flushes sleeplessness at night enlarged breasts  weight gain inreased restess leg syndrone some anxiety and depression some oss of mental acuity ,3
"I was started on Zoladex without any information about it except that it was a shot. About six weeks after the shot the side effects started. My libedo went to zero,I gained weight all in my belly, I had hair loss, but the worst were the hot flashes. Four an hour was common but the absolute worst was that the hot flashes drasdictly affected my Parkinsons. Up to this point I showed few symptoms by taking medications. The symptoms can no longer be controlled with medication. My balance has gotten much worse and I have uncontrolled movement of my hands and very often with my legs. I was set to have the second shot three months after the first,but refused to take it. It is now ten months after the first shot and all of the side effects are as bad as they have been. I think zoladex should be taken off the market ",4
"I had severe endometriosis and at age 28, underwent lap & laser, then 3 months of Zoladex, then a second lap & laser to get rid of any remaining endo.  Side effects were tough - total menopause at age 28!  However, the treatment worked like a charm and it was worth every minute. I followed a totally organic diet throughout and actually lost 10 lb while on this drug.  I then fell pregnant within 6 weeks of my second lap & laser, and now have 2 beautiful kids and have not had any endo symptoms since.  That was 8 years ago.  I can't rate this drug (nor my first class OBGYN who did the surgeries) highly enough!",5
"Taking Zoladex + Tamoxifen for breast cancer. So far, have had no relapses in my breast cancer, so I guess its working. Still, side effects are dire, the worst being severe hot flushes, insomnia, mood swings, depression (although only a couple of days a month), extreme fatigue, no sexual desire, and a terribly dry complexion (I seem to have aged five years in only 12 months). Still, I only have one more year to go, so I guess I just have to weather it through!",4
"Diagnosed with estrogen-positive Breast Cancer in 2003. Did no chemo nor radiotherapy. Changed Lifestyle and diet. Had a relapse in 2010 and first thing my new doctor asked was if I was still having kids. Replied in the negative so he said he needed to stop the periods. Had no objection to this and so he administered first dose of Zoladex. I found out i had also developed fibroids. Started treatment in March 2010. Have seen the change in my condition. First of all, fibroids have shrunk as they no longer press on my bladder. Haven't had any periods and I hope they don't come back. Have hot flushes but they do not last for more than 2 minutes and they are very bearable. Have so much energy, good appetite and sleep well. However I do hope I do not have to continue it for more than a year as every drug has its side effects.  ",5
Male 67+. On a regimen of a shot every 90 days for two years. Have had 4 shots so far. Only side effect would be no libido at all. Other than that nothing. Outcome of 0 PSA supersedes the single side effect.  ,4
"many hot flashes, easely tired",1
my dr orginally was giving me the Lupron Depot for endometriosis which worked out great for me and after my insurance changed they would not cover it for breast cancer so I had to get the Zoladex and been suffering from fatique/headaches/pain. I would take the Lupron shot over Zoldex. Less irritation easier to handle but Lupron does not list breast cancer under diagnose. That is a shame ,3
I was on it for 6 months and it worked great. If you have Endometriosis and your doctor wants to put you on this I would recommend it. I have pain 3 weeks out of the month and for 6 months i had no pain at all. It is not the best felling when you are getting the shot in your stomach but i would do it again in a heart beat. Hope this helps anyone who is going to have this treatment. ,5
"Works well to reduce PSA levels... Side effects for me are the almost unbearable hot flashes, weight gain, back pain and neuropathy in my hands and feet. I'm also diebetic but the burning and tingling has never been this bad.",5
"cont'd uterine bleeding longer than 30 days, even after add-back therapy of large doses of Estrogen. Frontal Lobe Headaches, worse with bending over. Treatment was to thin the inner lining of the uterus, due to Fibroids and before Uterine Ablation Procedure.",1
"It was so wonderful living pain free while on this injection, having no periods was a bonus too.  The only hassle was finding medical staff experienced in administering the injection and found going to the local hospital quite good.  Also asked for general anes. cos do not like needles, and this one is big!!  The hot flushes were a bit of a pain, but got used to them and prefered them to pain.",5
has had one side effect...about 3 weeks after injection has bad mood swings and violent behavior. Dr's have no idea why this is. PSA level started out 6 months ago at 12+ now it's almost less than 1 bur we have these mood swings that are HORRIFIC....,4
"I could not tolerate Tamoxifin after my cancer treatment, so I have been receiving the injection for 9 months. I find the injection to be painfull for the first several days and the bruising last for several weeks. The first several days I can experience nauseau, hot flashes, and fatigue. I have gained weight, but I could not figure out why so I was glad to see other comments on weight gain.  I have been diaganosed with high blood pressure, but I do not know if it is related to the shot. I cannot say to the effectiveness because I have to receive the injection for 3 to 5 years. I am crossing my fingers. ",4
"lower abdominal aches after injections for a few days than back to normal was on 1 implant for a while than had to increase to 2 implants to stop my menstrual cycle after about a year had to start back up on the implants because cycles started again now on 3 implants every month for the last 4 months don't know how long I'll be on it this time around. But, as long as it keeps my cancer from returning I'll take it as long as needed.",4
just started it,5
After trying for several years to get pregnant my doctor found out I not only had endometrosis but several fib. I have been on lipron to a force menapause and had fib surg. finally I got pregnant but only carried 6wk. last year my endemetrosis and fib came back I have been on zoledex for what is soon to be 6 months. I truely understand the VERY bad HOTFLASHES not to mention the moodswings I am hoping that in a few months to try to get pregnant again..hope is always there..,4
"I started Zoladex five yrs ago when I was 37. I am now going to pursue a hysterectomy. The drug was effective at keeping the cancer from returning, but the side effects have really been horrible. Mood swings, depression, hot flashes, insomnia, my blood pressure and cholesterol went wacko, weight gain, vaginal dryness and alternating yeast and bacterial infections. My body does not like this drug, but really didn't have an alternative except hysterectomy. ",5
"The side effects hot flashes, flushing and sweating, has had a very big impact on me. All day and night, I have to change my clothes two or three times a day. I have had surgery and take other meds for this cancer.",5
"side effects are evident - hot flushes, weight gain, depression.",5
I feel this medication has trully helped me an not very many side effect. I trully would recommend this to breast cancer patients.,5
"I was diagnosed with endometriosis 15 years ago. The pain has been manageable and it hadn't caused too many problems for me until I decided to have a baby. After my surgery, my doctor thought Zoladex might be my best chance of being able to conceive. I have just finished my 6th (and final) month of treatment. My doctor also put me on Effexor 75mg/day to help with the mood swings and hot flashes. That helped alot. I still had hot flashes but not nearly as bad as other people have described. Just as soon as my menstrual cycle returns, we are going to start trying to conceive. That will be the true test of how well it worked.",4
"I was diagnosed with endometrosis at the age of 17 and 8 years later, I'm still having trouble. I've had 3 laproscopic surgeries over the years and when the endo. returned, I just didn't want to do another one... so I decided to try the injections. Over the 6 months my mood swings were like nothing I'd ever experienced! I had all the symptoms of menopause- night sweats, decreased sexual desire, hot flashes!, etc. It has been about 9 months since the tx ended and I haven't had any pain. However, the 15 lbs I gained over 6 months is still attached to my butt! ",5
I have been on the Zoladex for a little over 2 months for treatment of my endometriosis. This is my last option before I have to have a hysterectomy. So far it has been working pretty well. The only side effect I have really had is hot flashes which do get very annoying at times. But I can deal with the hot flashes since the medicine its self is doing what it was given to me to do...keep me pain free the endometriosis. So far this is the only medication I have tried that is keeping 100% pain free. I am very happy with it overall. The only thing I do not like is having to have the shots given in the stomach. After both shots that I have had so far my stomach was very tender at the site of the injection and I was very bloated for a couple of days afterwards. But overall it is working very well for me so far.,5
"Over the past 12 months, I have taken Zoladex and Arimidex.  Even though I have done a good job of restricting calories and exercising, it has been impossible to lose the weight I gained through chemotherapy 2 years ago.  I am going off this drug now, and will only be taking Arimidex, so we'll see if that helps the weight problem at all.  Also, have experienced vaginal dryness,  sensation of warmth at times (but not actual hot flashes) , sweat easily when exercising outdoors,  and some muscle stiffness.",4
Hotflashes are horrible with this. Less desire for sex. Helped with the pain in the begining but no longer... im going to be getting a hysterectomy. ALSO this made me gain over 10 lbs!!!!,2
"Worst side effects: hot flashes, insomnia and forgetfulness.",4
My entire body hurts all the time and I am always tired,5
My impant is in the inside of my upper arm and it seems to work out well,4
"I received the Zoledronic acid infusion on November 8, on November 13, i was hospitalized for fever of 104, i could not walk,my body ache all over and most of all my neck was stiff. My oxygen levels were low and i couldn't breathe..this is the worst drug ever please,please DO NOT TAKE! ITS DECEMBER 7 AND THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE STILL THERE...IT'S NOT WORTH IT!",1
"July 6, 2018 was my 5th yearly infusion.  The next night I had terrible pains shooting through my entire  body, the calves of my legs hurt so much I was in tears, my thighs and groin area hurt so much that I was scared and I had no idea what had happened or why, my arthritis flared up, I experienced nasal congestion, I was extremely tired, after about two weeks my teeth hurt for two days, and I still have some shooting pains on occasions.  I still have arthritis that is much more painful than it was before.  Because I was awake all night I read the medication information, and realized this horrible pain all night came from the Zoledronic Acid. Calling the pharmacist, as recommended on the page of side effects, was not helpful, because he just casually interrupted and said I had side effects so I should take Tylenol.  And the doctor basically said that they can't take the infusion out of the body but my side effects will eventually subside.  I wish I could back- track from this nightmare, and just do exercises, eat well, and take my chances.  I had been recovering from other medical issues, but I had managed to walk a good distance on a daily basis; now, after this infusion I can not walk as well, I tire easily, my knees are a pain, and I am angry that this treatment is presented as having just a few side effects.  ",2
"If I had been told of the possible side effects, I would never have used this drug.   It is now over 6 weeks since I had the infusion and I still feels some of the effects especially in my joints.    The second and third day I could barely get out of bed, nausea, headache, serious flu symptoms.  Then a week after my leg was so swollen I could not bend it.   The endocrinologist on call said to go to emergency where they drained my knee.   Then a week after, my other knee started acting up.   It took over two weeks to get rid of most of the inflammation and still have problem.   My specialist did not know what to do about any of the side effects.   When I asked him why he did not tell me of the serious side effects he did not know about those I had.   I am a very active person who does squash, biking, tennis, etc.  Have not been able to do any of those sports since then.   I have lost confidence in specialists.  It seems they are distributors for drug companies.   They don't look at any other type of remedies.",1
After my first treatment yesterday the feelings are horrible.  I ended up in emergency.  It’s just HORRIBLE God has to show me that I need this to continue. ,1
"I had 2 yearly infusions, am seriously considering not having the 3rd. No reduction in micro-fractures. Told initially it would take 3months to be active in preventing them. During year 2 they gave similar excuses for continued micro-fracturing. I don't believe this works, in fact my teeth are now crumbling to bits rapidly since beginning treatment. The old diet and exercise cure is really the only valid option. That and spiritually healing your blocks and fears. How can a medicine be valid if it crumbles one set of bones to build up another. Nonsensical and I believe extremely toxic. Cure yourselves instead and don't trust big pharma unless you have no alternative!",1
I have started this monthly treatment in August 2016. After each I end up with eye ach above left eye only. I now have to take aspirins and Benadryl for 6 days to clear it out. Everything that I have read states this is a 'rare' condition. Treatment is suppose to be for 3 years. Hope this clears up. ,4
"This is a followup on my previous 2 entries after being given the IV fusion of Zoledronic back in Nov of 2015. I still am being treated for the rash and itching that occurred approx 2 weeks after the IV at the VA Hospital. I've seen 4 Dermatologists at the VA Hosp and have been prescribed numerous meds and to take cool showers and use ice when itching is severe. The last Dr I saw was about 2 weeks ago and he prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP,0.1% and 2 days after I am finally seeing results. The itching is gone and the redness where the bumps had broken due to scratching is relieved and they form a scab and the scabs are dropping off,  It is such a relief! I suppose that they may have given me the other drugs previously then worked up to this drug at this time perhaps. Though it is NOT fully cleared up I definitely feel and see an improvement on my back; however, my scalp and neck have yet to show the same response; i.e., it seems to be taking longer. I will keep you updated. WOW! It has been over 8 months since I had that IV and putting up with this. I don't go shirtless because of what it has looked like on my back.   ",1
"I ent'd a review on 12/5/15 that I had just had the infusion in Nov and would give an update after I maybe would see some results. Well NO positive results have been conveyed to me by the Endo @ the VA. However I have been seen by the VA clinic for itching and also at the VA Hosp in LB for continued severe itching and bumps that have turned to sores. It started on back of my neck in early Dec then to my R shoulderblade and across the back in late Dec. It continued across back of my waist and then the scalp in Jan. It has continued in Feb to the sides of my legs and outside of arms in Mar. In Apr saw it continue to the sides of chest across the chest and underarms. The sours seems like they are NOT healing and I am covered with them to where I don't want to be shirtless. The lack of healing may be exacerbated by the fact that I am diabetic on Insulin Pump therapy. It is difficult to rotate the infusion set for my insulin around my waist because of the sours and EXTREME itching. I've seen 3 different Dermatologists in 4 visits to the VA Derm Dept. I been given Clobelasol Propionate, Diphenhydrosmin HCL,and Doxy 110 I have another appt on the 29th Apr. This is awful sleep pattern is way off. Can't go out always itching SEVERELY! No other symptoms and they say they think it it from the drug since no other symptoms causes. Will keep you up to date, it took me some time to find the site after my last entry of 5 Dec. I had the IV infusion Nov 21st.  ",1
"On 1/6/2016 I got the Zoledronic Acid Infusion for bone loss. On the day I got it all was well. When I woke up around 3;00 a.m. the side effects were Horrible. It felt like my bone, muscles and organs were on fire or being electrocuted. But the next day was much better. If this doesn't help my bone lost I will never do this again!",3
"Had infusion IV at VA last week and have had NO side effects or reactions during these very few days. I am Diabetic and Bone Scan and Test showed Osteoporosis in 1998 and again this year, I will update in about a month as to any side effects that I might encounter, if any.  ",5

After 2 weeks, I still have severe headaches every day, chills, and a very stiff neck.  The dr. says this is unusual and I attribute the excess pain to my spinal stenosis condition.  I will not take the drug again, even if it helps my osteo.",1

"Within a week I noticed a bone pain in my right arm and within that week it moved to both my knees and bones running down to the ankles. The bone pain in the arm went.  The leg pain has stayed  This pain is very severe, it comes and goes, but I do not have a day with out the pain. I can wake up at 4-5 a.m. in extreme pain.Going up and down stairs is painful. Panadol does dull it but only Celebrex gives me relief.  I would never use this drug again   ",1

This drug has been my worst nightmare. Even after 6 months, the pain persist. I've contacted FDA concerning this drug.",1
"i started complaning of increased joint pain within a month of getting the infusion, soon after i had so much jaw pain i couldn't sleep. i also had an itch on my arms and legs that only could be controlled with cold showers, and this was extremely painful since i also am being treated for psoriatic arthritis, the va told me these were not listed side effects and i should continue with the treatment, now i have a hole forming in the roof of my mouth, also not a listed side effect, dont think i will continue, i would rather crawl around bent over",1

I got an i.v. drip of this drug ordered by my doctor with no heads up as to what it was or why he ordered it. I was as sick as I've ever been.

Had breast cancer 3 yrs ago & need to take Arimidex (estrogen blocker)for 5 yrs as it can cause 10% bone loss. First infusion was 2 months ago. Had slight leg cramps 2 days after infusion nothing further. This has been good to me. Prepping for infusion is critical for minimum SE of infusion! 8-10 glasses of water for 3 full days before infusion and 2 days after. Be proactive & do your research so u know what to expect. Ask drs. lots of questions. I get info from nurses that do the infusions. These people know best not all these sites online. I want others to know most reviews are people unhappy with results & I'm hear to say, trust your Dr. & if you don't have 100% confidence in them, find a Dr. You do; it means everything in your fight to keep surviving!",5
I had extreme bone pain after the last infusion.,5
I've been on monthly IV infusions of Zometa since diagnosis 18 months ago.

"I had the infusion on the advice of my physician as I have osteopenia.  I asked 3 times for specific side effects.  Was told flu like symptoms and maybe some joint swelling for 24-36 hours.  Boy was that incorrect!  I had joint and bone pain so bad that I couldn't get out of bed for 12 hours.  Chills (could not get warm even with 4 fleece blankets on me) that lasted for 4-5 hours.  Headache and nausea for 2 weeks.  Urinary retention for 1 week, lower extremity edema which I still have 6 weeks later.  Some occasional unstableness/dizziness when walking.  I still have the joint pain/swelling.  The worst is the leg swelling.  My lower leg is painful, hard, hot and swollen and it is painful to stand for long periods or to walk a lot.  It is 2 inches larger in diameter than the other leg even after elevating my leg and wearing a compression stocking. My foot also swells.  I had an US for DVT--negative except for the extreme amount of edema.  I also had an abdominal and pelvic CTV to see if I had thrombosis in my iliac veins.  Again negative.  I will NEVER have this drug again.  There is nothing anyone can say that will convince me that this is a ""safe"" drug.  I really don't know yet if this drug was helpful but since I won't take it again, that is a mute point.  I will take my chances and hope and pray I don't break a bone.  I just wish I was better informed by my healthcare provider before I agreed to have this drug.  I believed and trusted that she was informing me of ALL the side effects but not again. If I had be adequately informed, I would not have had this drug.  Please carefully weigh all the pros AND cons before having this drug.  ",1
"I have breast cancer in my hip after 17 years being cancer free.  The first treatment left me unable to function for 4 days.  Fever, severe bone pain, lethargy and some jaw pain. Being lethargic was actually a good thing because it was extremely painful to move.  I just had the third treatment and haven't had the bad side effects since the first time.  Drink lots of water before and after treatment.",3
"I have a rare autoimmune disease called ""Behcet's Disease"". Because Prednisone is the only drug that can stop my weekly flares, the use has caused me to have bad Osteoporosis. I had the first infusion five days ago and had terrible side effects, high fever, severe deep bone pain everywhere, migraine headaches, flu like symptoms, nothing tasted good,and could not sleep.Five days later I'm a tiny bit better, no fever, still have bone pain, less severe. I see some cut their dose in half to lessen the side effects, will be talking to my doctor about cutting the dose. If this doesn't work I won't ever get another infusion ever again of this drug.",2
"The Zometa IV infusion over about two years caused necrosis of the lower jaw.  I was being treated for prostate cancer. Necrosis was discovered by a dental surgeon's panoramic x-ray.  Stopped Zometa immediately.  Dentist prescribed 250 mg of Penicillin 4 x per day. OK so far. Necrosis is stable, i.e., not increasing.    ",1
Have never had any side effects. Drug is infused over 30 minutes with a dextrose solution. Hole in spine is closing as a result of drug. Was told it could take up to two years for cancer to be completely erradicated.,5
"The day after I received the shot, my throat started to close as I was eating breakfast. A piece of cereal caught in my throat which my husband was able to help me expel it with the Heimlich maneuver. I am taking Zometa because I am on lisinopril for breast cancer. Twice, I have tested as having more calcium in my blood than I should have. I have noticed that my nails ar getting stronger since I had the shot. In fact, I have a severe ingrown toenail which I attribute to my very strong nails. My oncologist wants me to take this every 6 months, because there seems to be evidence that it helps against a recurrence of breast cancer.",3
"Sore muscles, chills, painful joints, ",2
"On my 4th treatment. My first treatment I had MANY side effects, headache,aches and pains etc.  I read if Zometa is given over a 30 minute time span instead of 15 side effects are minimal. I don't know if it is coinsidence or my body got used to the drug but I don't have any side effects other than Fatique since changing to the 30 minute dosage.",4
No problems with the injection.  Zometa treatment not covered by Medicare or my supplement.  Should be if it is such a good treatment.,3
just had my first iv Zometa with not so nice side effects. Had breast cancer and had radiotherapy. Didnt require Chaemo. Wondering what advantage this is in post menapausal women 63yrs.Can I get research anywhere on this group ,1
I am using this drug for bone thinning. The day I had the infusion I had chills and my hips hurt really bad. The next day I felt like I had the flu. I will have another infusion in six months. I hope this will work to strenthen my bones.,4
My bones are stronger.I recieve treatment once a month by IV.I have not experience no bad side effects.,5
Taking for 2.5 years.  Usually on day 2 after I have flu like symptoms.  Doc told me to take Tums on day of iv.  This works pretty well.  The symptoms are tolerable.,4
mild nauseousness day of injection,4
"First treatment, the next day I was in bed with pain all over.  The following ones have been with no side affects at all..  I am now in my 7th monthly infusion.  This last one made more tired for some reason.  I must say I am very pleased with the ease of use, and very satisfied.  As far as working, only time will tell.  I did not have pain until I broke a bone in my shoulder.  That is how the metasteses was discovered. Now have it also in sternum and in back ribs.  None of them ever caused my any pain until the shoulder break occurring from attempting to button my jeans...  That was the worst pain aside from giving birth! !... It took about 8 months to heal and very little pain when truing to reach up to high..",5
"This has helped with my bone loss from chemo and radiation for the past three years but is extremely painful for me for four days, given once a year by IV, I have extreme flu like symptoms that are very painful.It affects the larger bones mostly, hips and back giving me a severe headache.I find no comfortable way to sit or lie down.I have to take Vicadin for four days to get though it, but the advantage is how it has increased the strength in my bone loss and improved my bones.It affects everyone differently and unfortunately I have severe pain with this.I recommend it for improving your bone strength.",5
"I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 12/09.  Received radiation for plasmacytoma in my skull.  Have been receiving Zometa infusions monthly for a year.  Just lately experiencing pain in  my upper arms.  Hard to life my arms up to take off a shirt, etc.  Still, I think its a small price to pay for benefit.  I still have M/M, but my blood numbers are good and fairly constant.",4
"1st dose real bad side effects 2 days then eased up, take every 3 months just over 5 years, tolerate better however ongoing side effects that are unbearable, I've decided to discontinue Zometa/Zoladex/Aromasin and see if my quality of life improves as I've been in bed the most part of three years w/ side effects, was diagnosed Breast Cancer 6 years ago stage 3C w/ 11 positive out of 14 lymph nodes, estrogen +. Treated w/ adriamiacin, cytoxin & taxol. Then radiation followed by zoladex/zometa/aromasin therapy. Any thoughts/suggestions much appreciated, anyone else choose to discontinue Zometa against Dr.'s advise?",5
"A lesion was found on my pelvis after a pet scan. I received radiation, chemo and zometa. After six months the lesion was gone. I have to continue taking zometa by i.v. for up to two more years.",5
I have had a treatment of Zometa once a month for the last 2 years. Side effects have been the same every month. Flu like  feelings sore swollen feet and hands. Very tired and usually down in bed for two days.,4
Very mild aches for a couple of days.,5

"I had breast cancer , recurring after 37 yr. I was taking Arimidex which ruined my already fragile bones. I only get Zometa every 6 mos and have had no problems with it.",3
I had my first treatment yesterday.  24 hours later I was struck with stabbing pain in my lower belly and have to keep taking pain relievers to get by.  I'm going to have to call in tomorrow to get more pain meds.,3

"No fracturs,except a fractured wrist probably not related to Osteroporosis NO REPEAT OF FRACTURES DENTAL PROBLEMS ",4
Had my first Zometa IV infusion a couple of weeks ago.  My only complaint seems to be with the fatigue factor since.  It seems to be pernicious and it is possible that is linked to some anemia issues.  Blood test results are going to be checked again in a few days to see if that is a contributing factor. ,4
joint and bone pain after treatment.jaw pain and bones growing under dentures.,1
Treatment once a month.  Overall I have been good.  Some neck pain but no side effects after 4 months.  ,3
This medicaion makes me week and have severe bone pain for the first week ,4
Side effects were similar to Neulasta.  I could not get out of the bed the day after taking the Zometa IV.  I had an extreme headache.  Joint and muscle pain restricted me to bedrest for 2-3 days.  I was told to take Tylenol for possible side effects but this did not relieve the pain.,3
NO PROBLEMS EXCEPT DO NOT TAKE WITH IRON INFUSIONS,5
"I have been on monthly zometa for almost 5 years, it has stopped me from having dental work BUT I do NOT think I would be walking and functioning as well as I am without it. Sometimes after a treatment I have flu like sympstoms, sometimes I do not and even feel like I could run a marathon that afternoon after the treatment. I tolerate it well and think it has helped me immensely where other things have not. I would not be doing well without itl. If you want to write to me please feel free to.l",4
had IV treatment 2 days ago. spent all day yesterday in bed. today...I STILL FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN HIT BY A FREIGHT TRAIN!!!! morphine hasn't even relieved the pain. i can't use my left arm without agony.,4
I had no ill effects from this drug.,5
"This was the worst medicine I've ever encountered and I had chemo.  I was sick as a dog for 4 days, sweating, sipping water and immediately throwing it up and lost 10 pounds before the week was over.  It's a week today and I'm still not feeling well in my stomach.  You couldn't pay me to take this medicine again.",1
I am trying to see what is the best I V for me .I have osteoperosis and the bones are a -3 . thanks for letting me read this page.,1
"A FEW SIDE EFFECTS, LIKE TROUBLE SLEEPING AND MUSCLE WEAKNESS.",3
"I have metastatic breast cancer through-out my bones,ribs,legs,spine. I have taken this drug for five months and I am starting to feel some improvement. The first dose put me in bed for two days with a fever and body aches. My doctor reduced the dose by half and I was able to tolerate the the side effects more easily. Again I had a fever and body aches but they lasted six hours. The following dose produced no side effects. My physician increased the dose to the full amount. I am tolerating the drug and I have much less pain in my neck. Basically, over time and with patience, this course of treatment seems to be helping.",3
"only had two doses/ first dose absolutely horrible side effects. every joint,bone and muscle hurt for days. could not even lift fingers or walk without bottoms of feet hurting.fever as high as 103 for few days. headache, teeth pain. secondosage, better less side effects. nurse administered oever a longer period of time, said would help with side effects.",4
"I have recurrent breast cancer in my liver and my hip.  I've been radiated in the hip and it worked thankfully.  However because its in the bones my Dr. strongly suggested taking Zometa to prevent possible fracture.  I just completed my 4th treatment and after the first one I only had some body aches for a couple days and then the next 2 treatments I had no side effects but the most recent treatment gave me some pain in my hands and feet-not too bad-I can still walk and exercise so I'm not complaining.  I just wanted to write because its seems every time I read a review of drugs I'm on, only the women who have horrible side effects report so I'm one of the more positive testimonies, thankfully-I'm sure there's more positive stories out there as well.",5
"I had two Zometa I-V infusions in the first and second months post-stem cell transplant.  I developed horrific, incapacitating pain in my muscles, bones, and joints, throughout my body.    I was prescribed extra-strength Vicodin, which barely ""touches"" the pain.  It is now 4 months later, and the pain has continued (in both shoulders, arms, and lower back).  Just last week I was dx with adhesive capsulitis, as result of the Zometa.  I tolerated the drug pre-transplant.  I have to wonder if others have suffered as I have as post-transplant Zometa users?",1
I have had no side effects and have been taking it for over 3 years. I have been cancer free for over 2 y ears.,4
"I had my first infusion of Zometa three days ago.  Spiked a fever day two, severe bone, joint, muscle pain day three, less morning of day four.  I hope this works.  I can't live on tylenol extra strength.",2
no side effects,5
"I have taken Zometa only once.  The side effects wewre terrrible including chills, fever, flu like symptoms for two days, pain in my hands, feet, and hips that so far have lasted for 10 days.  Dring this period I was unable to use my hands for about one day, unable to wear shoes for two days and I am still having difficulty walking after 10 days.  I wonder when the side effects will end.  In my opinion, this is an awful drug.  Any possible benefits are not worth the consequences.  ",1
"Had the infusion in March 09 after having a painful wedge fracture a few months earlier. I can not tolerate the oral meds because of osephageal, heart burn problems. I reseached all I could .. the most important finding for me was to Drink Plenty of Water.. before and after. I also drank during the infusion. I was given 2 Panadol straight after and continued taking these every 4 hours for the next 3 days. I had only minimal flu like symptoms and was a bit tired. I will definatly continue next year.My fracture is still causing pain. ",4
i do not have any side effects.  easy to take all i have to do is sit for about 20 minutes  then i am able to leave by myself.,4
"I have only had 1 treatment. First day was fine, second day had chills and stiffness in muscles, flu like symptoms.  Third day I woke up with a horrible pain in the left side of my head that seems to travel down to my neck, I've had that pain all day for 4 days now, I'm starting to believe it is from jaw pain I am starting to feel. I am only recieving the drug every 6 months so benefits outweigh discomfort.",3
"12 hours after my first treatment I developed fever to 103 that lasted 4 days, rigors, myalgias, parasthesias, muscle & joint pain. I vomited one whole day. The 5th day I was terribly weak & dehydrated.  I was taking it to prevent bone mets from my Breast Cancer.",3

"I RECEIVED MY MEDICARE ART A FORM TODAY AND FOUND OUT THAT THE ZOMETA INFUSION I WAS PRESCRIBED WAS ACTUALLY RECLAST.  I TOOK IT IN AN INFUSION AND DID NOT FEEL MANY CHANGES, BUT AS TIME WENT ON,  I FOUND MYSELF VERY ILL FROM ANOTHER CONDITION, FIRST FROM FATIGUE, THEN MORE SERIOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SYMPTOMS.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS RECLAST (PERHAPS GIVEN BY MISTAKE) OR I AM SUFFERING FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REASON.   ",1
I have metatasic breast cancer. 24 hrs after my first session was uncomfortable. Flu-like symptoms and muscle/bone ache. every session after that became easier. Now I take Zometa only with Herceptin (by port) and I have little to no side effects beyond being a little tired the day I receive treatment. ,5
"I had flu like symptoms (fever, aches, dizzy) for a couple of days after the infusion. I have a little jaw pain today and have called the doctor about it. I don't know if it is related to the Zometa but the doctor said to call if there was any jaw pain.",3

In fact he has begged to come of them but he was encouraged to keep trying. He is 80 and diagnosed 2 years ago with prostate cancer. Since taking them he has been bed- ridden (almost immediately after taking first dose). He experience severe hot flashes, sweating, lack of energy, no appetite, confusion(not characteristic of him).

"83-years-old. Have had Pca for 17 years. Have been under treatment at MSKCC for most of that time. Tried a number of drugs, all of which worked for short time but made me ill. Best results were with Lupron + Casodex, but Casodex ultimately failed. Have been on Zytiga + Lupron for one year. Excellent results. PSA down to below 01.0.Not wealthy so received the drugs from J&J assistance program for that year. Must renew application for assistance every year. This time around, J&J is not renewing my prescription (I'm not indigent enough). Many thousands of dollars for a one-month supply are not possible for me or most of you. J&J's marketing plan is beyond understanding. Patient must either be indigent, very wealthy or has to face dismantling his family's economic well-being so as to gain the possibility of a year or two more of life. There are millions of men with Pca throughout the world, only 10% of them can afford to pay the retail price of Zytiga. Wouldn't  J&J do better selling its great product to many more men at a lower price? But who needs common sense (or compassion)? So, beware.  JOHNSON & JOHNSON, DO TAKE NOTE: FOREIGN SOURCES (Israel, Canada, maybe India) are becoming available--but still around $1,000 per month. ",4
As a result of continued PSA elevating my doctor started me on lupron injections quarterly. The lupron initially worked for about six months and thereafter failed to address the rising PSA which went up as high as 135. My doctor started me on Zytiga which I have been on for over six months. within the first 30 days my PSA went down from 135 to 3.5. 60 days later my PSA went down to 0.3.,5
"My husband has been taking zytiga for about 5 months, and I cannot say enough good things about the drug (so far).  It has been a literal life saver.  He has had no side effects and his PSA has gone down from over 1000 to 62 in such a short time.  It has given him back a decent quality of life which was quickly eroding when he was on chemo.  We have been treating his stage 4 cancer for about 11 years.",5
Have been taking Zytiga for 19 mos.PSA dropped immediately from 300 to 25 and has remained there.I have had a cough since beginning zytiga which has since become chronic.Clinical trials published by developer Jannsen Pharmacerticals list cough as the number 1 side effect at 17.5% of 1088 trial participants with castrate resistant prostate cancer.,5
"BEWARE! after taking the second dose (1000 mg + prednisone) my husband started having tremors and then uncontrollable muscle spasms. I started in his left leg making it spasm, and jump.Soon it was his whole lower body and then it spread to his upper body.   For 10 hours this went on and then slowly eased off in the next couple of hours. We called the DR. who said he didn't know what was wrong, or what we could do about it. Told us there was nothing HE could do about it and to stop taking it if we wanted to and see him at his next appt.(Feb 2)This seemed like he could care less. All the time my husbands arma and legs are jumping all around.  I called the pharmicist, who was very helpful,but also said she could'nt find anything that may have interacted with it. It finally completly wore off after about 15 hours of misery and now he feels OK, just tired. We won't be taking Zytiga anymore!",1

Wonderful drug, no side effects. I pray it keeps working. ",5
"I have been on Zytiga for two months. The constant bone pain went away during the first week of treatment. My PSA dropped from way over 1,000 to the low 90s in 50 days. Life is so normal now, that it is scary; i fear what will happen when the drug hits its nadir. Regardless, life is much better on this drug.  The cost however is beyond the pale. It works.",5
so far excelemt re sults-no side effects,4
After failing to get results with Taxotere my oncologist switched me to Zytiga. At that point my PSA had erupted to 208. In one month of Zytiga it dropped to 123 and now at the two-month mark it is 59.,5
No side effects at all. I have regained most of health back in less than 2 months. PSA down from 599 to 32,5

My husband has been on the drug for two months and we already have had positive results.  Sadly our insurance company is taking it away from him and making him do the hard core chemo..Hope it will cost them more in the long run!,3
