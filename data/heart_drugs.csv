This medication caused swelling in my legs and very hard to find at the pharmacy. I have to order it in advance,3
causes headache and dizziness ,2
My blood pressure is good but I have very dry eyes to the point that by the end of the day they are burning....and the first week or 2 severe stomach pains but that has subsided.,4
This medication has helped stabilize my pressure but i noticed muscle soreness in my legs and sort of heart throbbing to where it seems as though the the ground or surface is shaking below me,4
"I have mild to moderate hypertension untreated. I don't have any kidney disease or diabetes.  Tried Diovan, Exforge, Cardura, HCTZ which did not work well.. Valturna has been great BP 110/70 with no side effects. ",5

"I would just like to know why when I try to get the info on this drug from this site  such as side affects ect. nothing comes up seems to be that most of my meds. I have tried to research are doing the same thing. They don't give me info on this site. I'm taking furosemide 40 mg. for water retention, spironolactone 25 mg. for water retention,bisoprolol 5mg. to slow heart rate and lower blood pressure and aliskiren 300 mg. for  high blood pressure. Had to stop spironolactone due to rectal bleeding and stomach pain. I am asthmatic and am really having hard time breathing after I take bisoprolol. I am going to slowly get off this drug, as I have found out that asthmatics should not be taking it. The doctor that prescribed this drug knows I am an asthmatic. Now I'm being sent to a asthma doctor as my asthma is out of control. So they will probably add some more drug and then more side affects and the cycle continues. My blood pressure has dropped to a normal level and the water pills are draining the excess fluid away, but I am so fatigued I can hardly walk around my home let alone exercise or even have a sense of feeling well. I am so tired all the time and fall asleep sitting up. My Cardiologist said I will feel this way for at least  six months until my body adjusts to these pills. I just don't think one should feel so unwell from medications that are suppose to make you well. I felt better before I started taking these medications even though my blood pressure was extremely high and I looked like a swollen marsh-mellow.",3
My cardiologist gave me samples of this med- ication before my local pharmacy stocked. I have noticed no side effects. I take it with my a.m. meds.,5
"constipation, swelling, cramping in feet, legs,UTI, hair loss, stomach pain",3

"My blood pressure has been difficult to control. My doctor placed me on this formula, and it immediately leveled out. It is wonderful to have regular blood pressure and decent pulse.",5
"it does a fair job of lowering BP but has an endless amount of side effects. Extreme Hair loss, rapid weight gain, muscle soreness, pins and needle feelings, gas and bloating, depression and others to many to mention. This medicine should be taken off the market in my opinion. Very expensive price to pay to be miserable.",1
5mg ..after 2 days I am wondering why my nerves are so bad and feeling down and depressed.... I will try it longer and update....  But I am not liking it so far. Also I wish these were split into male and female as different meds act differently with sexes and weights ...Female  145lb  ,2
Feet swell up .,2
When i started using this med..i feel anxious depressed almost 6 months ..bullshit..,2
After two days of treatment I suffered severe swelling in my face. Had to go emgcare to for steroid shot to bring down swelling.,1
It will cause weight gain big time. I have been taking this drug for 10 years now. I went from 190lbs to 240lbs in ten years and I am a pure vegetarian. Vegies and fruits only. I go to the gym every day. Come to find out today this drug can cause cancer too. I will get a different drug today.,5
"On 5 mg.  Will be almost 3 weeks that I've been taking it.  Haven't noticed much of a change in blood pressure yet.  Since I started taking it, I have had terrible insomnia.  My heart is pounding a lot, even at rest.  Have a funky taste in my mouth all day long. Guess I better try something different. ",1
for those of us still with our teeth-long term this drug will wreck havoc on your teeth and gums. Can't complain on it's effectiveness with my HBP though.,3
"I switched from Losartan to Amlodipine about a month ago after many bad side affects from the Losartan. Although the Losartan did a much better job actually lowering my blood pressure, I have not experienced any side affects so far from the Amlodipine. ",3
"It helped bring my BP down to normal levels; however, it is difficult to swallow since it does not have a protective coating and leaves a very unpleasant residue in my throat.",4
"The diamond shape pill catches on my esophagus and I DRINK LOTS OF WATER WITH IT.  tHE OLDER WE GET, OUR ESOPHAGUS WRINKLES LIKE OUR BODIES AND WE DO NOT WANT AN ULCER IF IT DOES NOT GO DOWN PROPERLY.  SHOULD BE ROUND PILLS IN STEAD.",5
Please do not use this drug. it is just NASTY!! feels like your entire system is being poisoned especially if you are sensitive to calcium channel blockers.,1
I have been on this drug since having severe blood pressure and other problems from being prescribed too  high a dosage of diabetes drug a year ago. I have had severe pain and some swelling in my feet and thought it could have been from another drug I started at the same for bladder failure.  I have noticed a dark colorization of my bottom legs and thought it was from sun exposure and affects from a medication - the dis-colorization is still there and I now believe it is Amlopodipine that has caused this.  I am now discontinuing this med and will consult my mephrologist.,2
"my legs and feet have started to swell and I have terrible dreams when I do sleep,  I also feel anxoius",2
"Taking 5mg am, way to dizzy.  Started to break the pill in 1/2 helped with the dizziness.",4
"I've been prescribed this a few times, each time no matter what the dosage, I get bad swelling in my ankles and feet. The problem stops in a day or two when I go off the drug, so I know its the drug. It does appear to lower my BP somewhat, but the side effects outweigh the benefit especially since the side effects prevent me from exercising and at times, my legs physically hurt.",3
"This medicine has made me anxious, very easily upset,  have strange thoughts, lightheaded, my legs and knees hurt, tired all the time but I can't sleep.  All in all, a TERRIBLE experience.  Never taking this again.",4
Lowing my blood pressure.,5
"My dissatisfaction stems from the swelling in my lower legs/ankles.  To the extent that I ended up with a burning pain on the apex of my left ankle bone.  Could never wear sandals and after discontinuing, I realized the medicine was the cause of the swelling and burning.  In addition, it appears (now off Amodipine for 2+ weeks) that it - or the swelling - was causing some balance issues - which I attribute to a loss of leg strength.  For these reasons, I'm moving to another treatment option. ",4
I take 5 mg once daily and am 80 years old. I started taking about 6 months ago after the lisinopril caused coughing.The main side effect is urine retention for which I also take meds.,4
"Lost all my hair and blood pressure never went down , cartelogist took e off when I showed him my wig. that was the last straw for him.",1
Lately m'y pressure is bÃ©en very love.,2
eight weeks and great outcome.,4
I  take  2.5 mg each night and have for 4 years and it has worked excellently for me. ,5
"I started taking Amlodipine 10 mg with Losartan 50 mg to control my high blood pressure not too long ago. I do not have any side effects so far. Knock on wood! My blood pressure is now average 120-130/70-80 range. I decided to post my review because majority of reviews are pretty scary. Remember happy customers tell 3 people and angry customers tell 3000, so the same rule applies. The side effects are usually rare, and severe side effects (scary reviews you can find in this review) are extremely rare. If your doctor recommends it, try it out. You can quit anytime if you get any side effects you cannot live with.",3
"I am pharmacologist and I am using amlodipine (5 mg) with telmisartan (40 mg) since last 2 years because BP was 170/100. Combination was working fine. 6 months ago, suddenly I felt very awkwaard (Dizziness, disequilibrium, painfull stomach), I consult with cardiologist and he told to take only Telmisartan. before month I had severe stomach problem, So I thought it is because of Telmisartan. So I stopped telmisartan too. finally spent 10-15 days without medicine (No amlodipine no Telmisartan). Now BP was found 140/90. I thought to start amlodipine. Because of recent side effects, I stopped Telmisartan and started again Amlodipine. But, now Amlodipine is giving very odd feeling, though not swelling but stomach is hurting most, constipation (First time in life I felt stool is not passing), pain in legs, knee, slight in ankle.  3 days gone without amlodipine still effects not gone. I have decided will not take medicine either of it, going for exercise, diet and yoga. Never amlodipine again. I dont have cholesterol, sugar, no nicotine or alcohol consume. Only stress and loneliness has made me hypertensive. I have decided to lower bp without medicine. Listening music, talking more, walking 4-5 km. More water, less salt, yoga in morning. ",4
"BP came down a little, dr wanted to up the dose, but now legs are sore and veins swollen. Muscles very painful, affecting walking. Dont know if I want to take this?",2
Haven't had any problem with this drug. Works fine with little or no side effects. Price is not bad either.,5
Severe Migraine headaches and increased Blood Pressure,1
"I began after my bp shot up for no apparent reason to 190/90. My physician's assistant started me on this med. I took faithfully. About one week ago, my bp shot up one evening (after a long trip of heavy traffic) and was diastolic at over 90 again. I began the second tab immediately. I am a bit more dizzy, but my bp is coming down under 140/80 for the first time. I will enter a follow-up report in about two months. ",3
"This drug causes gingival overgrowth ""google"" it.  Faced with over 20K damages and no lawyer wants to take on the powerful drug company unless it has caused death.  I am forced to take this to small claims court where I can only sue for $10K.  Due to the overgrowth has left excess gum tissue in my mouth which needs to be cut away and shifted my perfectly straight teeth crooked.  BEWEARE",1
I started taking Amlodipine in Oct 2017 I noticed my hair is so much thinner but worse is my legs and calves swell so much they feel very heavy my doc seems to think the side affects out weigh the risks of HPB. I called her again and she is willing to change me something else hopefully I won't have tree stumps for legs very long .,3
The swelling  has included my legs as well as my feet. Some what painful.,4
"Major hair loss after being on this drug Amlodipine for four months. Once I was off it took another couple of months for my hair to stop breaking at the roots like that, I would run my fingers through my hair and WOW, a number of strands from the roots each time was coming out, this was totally different from normal breakage at the end, it definitely was cause for alarm, unlike anything I had ever seen with my hair, and no my hair wasnÃ¢Â?Â?t thinning because of age, my hair has always been thick and in very good condition. It did control my blood pressure, now I am on something else without hair loss as being one of the side effects.",2
"At five mgs, I began to have a sore tongue and canker sores in my mouth. I got worse tinnitus and also lost much of my tasting ability. I felt weak and tired a lot, and just did not feel right. When I stopped this medicine, all my bad symptoms disappeared and I feel normal again and my taste has come back. I will just stick to micardis and dump all other blood pressure drugs.",2
The generics are mostly not effective,3
"About 5 months now. Has lowered my BP from 158/92 to 123/71 but I'm dizzy frequently. Maybe it's to low for me? But side effects are the big problem. Taking 5mg and still have rashes on neck, terrible tendinitis day and night. Swelling neck glands, headaches, brain fog, lower back pain and itching different place everyday. Not a glowing review for sure. LOL I felt better with high blood pressure. Stopping the drug today.   ",3
"I have tried this twice, and it works for about an hour, and my blood pressure shoots back up.",1
Did not lower my pressure and swelling side effects  were horrible. Switched to lisinopril and pressure is now great and no swelling of ankles. ,1
"Used to get this medication in the round blue pill imprinted with A10, M physician directed me to split the pill in half only taking 5mg.  This medication was somewhat effective in treating my high blood pressure.  Last refill the pharmacy sent me a different pill that is a white round tablet imprinted with IG 239.  After taking this new half pill for a week, it is not effective in treating my blood pressure.  My symptoms are high blood pressure, swelling in feet, pounding heartbeats, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision and generally feeling ill and irritable.  ",1
Put on about 7 lbs in 1 mo.  Plus 2 pitting edema of both legs and can feel the puffiness all over.  Swollen eye lids.  Retaining water like crazy.,4
"Started it 11/10/17. Started feeling very bad and it kept getting worse. Could not sleep, nightmares, I think I was having panic attacks too, night sweats, heart racing, jittery all over, feeling sick at my stomach, grouchy and very miserable. I got maybe got one hour of sleep a night for quite awhile and my body refused to let me sleep in the daytime also. I have not taken it for 3 days and am feeling so much better I could almost shout. Been able to sleep too.  I was also on hydralazine and had same reaction. I sure don't recommend them. Didn't help my b/p either.",1
Severe hair loss with AMLODIPINE  Itâ??s brand name  NORVASC I have severe hair loss as well.   ,1
"I just gave this drug a good review a couple weeks back after just taking it a short time. I'll have to rescind those comments. After being on it a couple more weeks, the bad side effects were coming on strong. Headaches, dizzy, bad moods, even put on a couple pounds. The last thing I need for high BP is something that makes me put on more weight. ",3
"Hives broke put all over ny torso. Has since gone to my thighs. Burning, stinging and itching after 1 week use. Developed severe stomach pains which resulted in regurgitating. Haven't eaten a meal in 48 hrs. The smell of food increases the nausea I feel since taking amlodipine. I have discharged this medicine. Will discuss this with the doctor who I am also discharging. She knew this med has contraindications to another med which caused the HBP. Before taking diclofenac i never had hbp. So to counter the hbp she prescribed amlodipine rather than change the sciatic nerve pain reliever. I think she is a quack whose license should be revoked.",1
So far so good. Seems I have more energy. BP down to119/72 from 195/92 See some are mad at drug company. Did drug company prescribe?? NO Talk to your doctor!!! Some meds may be different than others!!,4
"Been on 5mg for only a week, but BP has dropped dramatically from 168/97 to 119/72. I generally react to drugs very quickly as far as if they will work for me or not. So far so good with no bad side effects, but I realize I'm still new to taking it. It seems to make exercise easier too.  I feel calmer, and every little annoyance doesn't get on my nerves. My wife really likes that! I hope it continues to work the way it is.",5
Have not had an erection since I started taking it. Remain dizzy with headache. Dr. is taking me off of this at next visit or else. There has to be a substitute.,1
I am going to sue this company!! Because of this drug my husband can no longer get an erection!!! Honestly. He had no issue what so ever until he took this. He also has to take two other pills because of swelling and low potassium that this drug caused. I don't understand why the doctor doesn't switch him to something else. Has anyone else had this problem and will he be able to get an erection if he stops using this drug? ,1
"not that effective, swollen ankles",2
"I have only been on amlodipine besylate 2.5 for 1 1/2 weeks.  It was given to me to replace atenolol 25(never a problem in 15 years) because I was unable to get the latter.  I have had a headache, eyes hurt since the day after I started.  I will stop them tonight.  I take losartin in the AM with no problem. Why does no pharmacy carry atenolol anymore?",3
"Thanks to all you patient reviewers, I owe you mine. I am quitting (Norvasc) generic Amlodipine Besylate  10mg, due to ineffectiveness and severe adverse effects. Previously 10+ years ago I took Diovan, had bad reaction low BP 60/40 and passed out so I quit BP meds. Restarted 3+ years ago with Amlo which was not effective so Dr. added Irbesartan 75mg then increased to 150mg and barely got down to 140/100. I had swelling of legs and feet and joint pain for months which I mistook as a result of injury from a fall on ice. Starting this year another Dr. switched me to Losartan 100mg. I also had occasional dry cough all along so to see if made any difference he switched me a few months ago to Lisinopril 40mg and cough got worse! Switched back to Losartan as pharmacist says it is next gen drug better than Lisinopril. Ok so cough almost gone, but leg and ankle swelling and chronic pain remains. Actively changed diet and increased excercised, lost some weight and BP became normal, so 2 weeks ago Dr. agreed to cut back Amlo to 5mg and drop it if BP remains normal. Swelling and pain is reduced so planning to stop Amlo next week.  Note: All drugs have side effects, even if by a small %. No Dr. or Pharmacist or Drug maker will tell you everything you need to know. You are not just a statistic filed with the FDA. Go back to nature!",2
"I took amlodipine for nearly two years.   My legs were perpetually swollen and felt uncomfortable as well as looking unsightly.   My blood pressure seemed normal, but one day I thought of putting the cuff on my legs and the pressure was very different -- over 220.   I asked my doctor (who had been unwilling to switch drugs) if it was really a good idea to have good pressure in my arms and highly elevated pressure in my legs.   I now take Losartan:  no side effects, good blood pressure control.   I strongly suggest that anyone suffering any swelling in their legs when taking Amlodipine should check the pressure in all limbs.   Legs can be higher, but not double.",3
"Been taking amlodipine with benazepril for about 4 years. began having dizzy spells, anxiety, nervousness, feeling faint. copied the side effects and took the list to my doctor, she said to only use the benazepril, and now BP slowly creeping back up. was at a good 120-70 on this med, now 145-80, this morning 165-80. Do not want to start back on the amlodipine but may just take half of the 10 mg dose.",5
"The medication was effective in assisting to manage my blood pressure, but with side effects that were not worth dealing with.  The medication caused dizziness, weight gain and depression.  I would not recommend this prescription.",4
what is the generic of this medication,4
"been having swelling in lower legs and ankles which has progressed over 6 months, now causing joint pain and stiffness.  also experienced moderate fatigue, shortness of breath, and weight gain.  all which make it hard to keep active and painful at time to exercise or climb stairs.  talking to Dr next week.

"I was coughing a lot with Vasotec, so my doctor switched me to Amlodipine 10mg. After that, I had terrible side effects, such as shortness of breath, knee pain, stomach pain, and tiredness. This drug is awful. I stopped taking it. Now Iâ??m trying to manage my blood pressure naturally with diet and exercise.  ",1
I just started taking this med as my blood pressure was 190/114.  I have taken this med along with Losartan 25mg after breakfast and i have notice stiffness on both of my legs on 1st day and stiffness of both arms on second day.  third day I only took Amlodipine (1) and no side effects felt.  might continue to only take Amlodipine. ,3

"I don't even think this medicine has helped. Gave me a hot feeling, head pressure, fatigue, out of it, blood shot eyes, swelling, red dots on my legs, flushing, and my legs would turn red and hot feeling. Definitely not a medicine for me. I'm on metoprolol now works wonders. ",3
"I started with a medical crisis with my BP.  Was presribed 5 mg/day and then after first day had to go to 10 mg/day as BP was still dangerously high.

"I was switched to this medication a week ago, and though my bp has gone down,my heart rate has soared, to 115 at one time, and I can constantly feel my heart pounding, very disconcerting. Back to the doctor in a day or two. I was on Atenolol before, which made my psoriasis worse,hence wanted to change but the Amlodipine is awful ",2

I was too scared to sleep. Finally in happened at work, ambulance to the hospital. Proceed with caution with this drug.",1
BP has been creeping up over a period of time.  It finally reached the 170/90 range and I began a physician assisted diet and walking routine.  Went for weekly diet weigh in and BO was 200/110.  They sent me directly to primary doctor.  I have been on amlodipine for a week so far and BP has dropped to 125/85.  So much better.,4
"Worked well for three days seemed to calm my nerves as well as my blood pressure reducing. Then came the joint pain so bad within a week i could not walk up or down the stairs without support had to stop it straight away.Even stopping after a short period my knee and foot still haven't recovered 100% yet that was a couple of months ago. Would never take it again, which is a shame because it worked for the blood pressure.       ",5
dr started me on this for hbp. I started having dry cough and awful swelling of the legs. Went back and he cut dosage in half (from 10 to 5) and added lisinoporil. Just read the side effects of that one and looks like dry cough is one for it as well. Will take this a few days to see if it helps or hinders or causes any other side effects.,3
"I stopped this medication after 7 days.  Very unfavorable side effects:  swelling in legs, pain in joints, feet hurt when in shoes, very tired/lethargic.",2

It felt as though I had narcolepsy- worsened to the point that I couldn't do anything without overwhelming urge to sleep. 2nd problem was frequent urination keeping me up all night, 3rd was very definite brain fog and muscle stiff. Difficult to find a secondary to telemasartin as now diastolic is 90, sistolic 130. Adding yet another hydralizine to bring it to 130/80. Will make other lifestyle changes- swim, walk and calorie reduced diet. ",1
"Hard to get used to -- side effects for me mostly fatigue, trouble sleeping.  However, plowing thru and increase exercising has lower my bp for the 140/90 to the 120/70 range,  Worth the effort.  Taking 5 mg with 40 mg Enalapril.  Without the Amlopidine, bp often topped 140.",5
"is it possible, my physicians states I now have more noticeable side affects including but not limited to diarrhea, not able to sleep to very tired, flushing, swelling in ankles and dizziness, so much I can't work. This is after taking 8 months????  So am being taken off med.  Just curious if this is normal??  Now no work for 5 more days. ",2
"Side effects started after 2 weeks. Lack of mental clarity -- people thought I was drunk! Low energy, disorientation but did lower BP to 125/85.",4
"My blood pressure was not under control and kept raising, last reading was 140 over 92 and range as high as 150 over 92.  This was even when I was on high blood pressure medication, first experience with Amlodipine was not successful with 5 mg.  Now on 10 mg taken at night, which I would highly recommend as drug is strong.  My blood pressure is now running between 122 over 80 and for average 112 over seventy.  Dropping it between thirty and forty points in a couple of months I am happy but tired most of the time.  I can become dizzy easy and once in a while must lie down, but I would take the low pressure anytime.  Remember this is strong medication and it will work, but be alert for the side effects, God Bless.  ",5
"I have been using this meds for 5 months. BP was 160/90..reduce to 159/82.side effects pain in both my legs,nervousness and lack of sleep. Definitely not working for me.My Gphave me trying another drug. (Viacoram)Perindopril",1

"Was prescribed Amlodipine on top of Losartan to bring down bp. Only lasted 3 days. Day 1 and 2: Severe bloating, nausea and mild headache from ears forward. Day 3: Severe stomach pain, nausea, violent vomiting, bloating and stabbing headache. Ended up in the ER. This medicine is horrifying if you are a person prone to side effects.",1
"I've only been taking it for just over 1 month and my blood pressure has dropped about 10 points. Still not down to perfect or steady but much improved. If I eat ""overly salty"" foods, I find I get more swelling around my ankles later on, but that only happened a couple of times. Also if I don't take them quite at the 24 hour interval, so it's less than 24 hours from my last pill, there seems to be more swelling/tightness around my ankles.",4
"Male, age 80, had to increase dose from 5 mg to 10mg to obtain very effective results.",4
"On a 10mg dose for a couple of years. BP clocks right in 120/80. Ankle swelling comes and goes and I just deal with it. Overall, it works as intended.",4
I had side effects.  Weakness in the legs and dizziness in the morning.  After about 3 -4 months I got a rash on my arms....  I did not do much about it until it spread to my neck and then my face.  I discontinued all other substances so I has to be this drug.  So I am discontinuing using this drug and hoping the rash goes away.  The rash got pretty bad... Very red face and puffy.  Super itchy and skin is dry looking like I have a bad sun burn almost.  Arms have the red raised areas and bumps as well.,5
After 2 months my ankles/feet were so swollen had a hard time putting shoes on and in the middle of the second month started with a red bumpy rash that is very itchy thought it was bug bites at first but when it kept spreading realized it was a rash from this med,2
"I notice hair loss, I am taken 10 mg.tab, in which it was increased.",4
"Very bad headaches since taking this drug, very tried, sick at the stomach",2
"it appears to be working, however after 5 months I must say that the side effects are getting worse such as itchy legs, red sensitive spots on my ankles. At the beginning swollen ankles however stabilized after a couple of months. I will have to find an alternative before it does more harm! but which medication should should I suggest to my doctor I should try?",2
I've been using this drug for over a year for hypertension that was running in the 140-150 over 88-98 range.  It seems to have lowered my BP into the 125-135 over 80-90 range. So it does what it's supposed to do but I have experienced some dizziness/light headedness and fatigue to the point where I'll be discussing with my doctor in the near future. Early on I also experienced some minor ankle swelling until I got back into a good cardio exercise program and the swelling went away almost immediately.  ,4
"I also take Atenolol 25mg twice a day, because of dizzeness I been taking Amlodipine at bed time only.  This seems to help and the combination of meds has lowered my blood pressure, I would suggest starting with 2.5 mg Amlodipine first.  This is a great med but use it with care, God Bless.",5
"not only did it not reduce my BP significantly but it produced a violent allergic facial skin condition ,first itching and red rash ,then hives [lumps ] and finally swelling all over my face resulting in a visit to A & E  and 4 weeks on steroids and many weeks of misery . There is a reference to this side effect being ""very rare"" but I wonder how rare it really is --manufacturers rely  on patients to report side effects , but when they are as extreme as this many people would wish to have nothing  more to do with the drug  or its maker -that is my reaction . The main problem with an allergic reaction of this sort is that it it is not immediately apparent what is causing it  ,particularly if you are taking other drugs . Also there are many other substances that can cause allergic  reactions and even a consultant dermatologist may not look at a mainstream drug as an obvious candidate when there be any number of environmental or food factors  involved .Only by a long and exhaustive elimination process was amlodipine identified as the villain in my  case --stopping taking it while continuing the steroids  cured it completely ,but as soon as I started again [still taking the steroids ] back it came and the steroids could do nothing to stop it . I think more research needs to be done on this --the swelling and hives if they progress inwards around the face can lead to serious complications.",1
"I have been taking it for 5-10 years. At first, it caused ankle swelling. That went away with time. It still causes some fatigue. But BP went from 150/100 to 120/70. Doctor said he could switch me to another med due to the fatigue, but all medications have side effects. I will just deal with the one I have.",5

"Tried Lisinipril which made me swell in face and hands, Losartin which made me have symptoms like I was out of breath, finally my Doctor put me on Amlopodine. I cant believe how much better I feel. It took me 18 years to feel better, don't let it happen to you. If you have a reaction get to your doctor. I thought it was my allergies and asthma when it was really my blood pressure medicine. Sometimes your Doctor takes a guess and your the loser.",5

All I saw with all of them was problems with cataracts and allergic rashes that would take down an elephant.  Why don't doctors' want to be doctors'.  They are drug dealers of the worst kind.,1
"I take 5 mg of this medication for over ten years and it has lowered my BP some but not quite enough so my MD added 10 mg benazepril which has helped a bit more. I have some fatigue, the swelling of the ankles has almost stopped, I do have some sleppless nights and some depression.

My doctor's out of town til next week.  so, until then, I'm going to try taking half of the 5 mg tablet & monitor my BP.

"After extremely high blood pressure, the cardiologist prescribed amlodopine.  I take the generic.  I have taken it for about 2 yrs.6 months into it, my thyroid started becoming irregular and I had heart palpitations. We tried adjusting the thyroid meds, but I kept getting heart palpitations even though the thyroid was running low.    After over a year of trying different meds for thyroid, I asked to be taken off the amlodopine since I read it can affect thyroid.  The good news is that I have not had a single heart palpitation since I stopped this med.  My bp is back to being high again, but hopefully the dr will prescribe something else other than this horrible medication.   By the way, I had no swelling, never realized the meds were causing the heart palpitations....I was blaming the thyroid medication.  I am glad I am off this. ",5

"I slowly started to experience dizzy spells while taking this medicine for 3 weeks.  No swelling like others have mentioned.  After cleaning for a few hours which involved bending over and moving my head in different directions I became extremely dizzy and tired. When laying flat on a few occasions I had vertigo where the room spun. Had to sit up to relieve the spinning.  My doctor said vertigo would be related to my ears and not a side effect.

"After repeated bp systolic readings over 200, I was started on this med in December 2013, and am still on it. I have also been on 2 other classes of blood pressure meds for years. All bp meds are at maximum dosage at present. I also have had a diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome with associated osteoarthritis in numerous locations AND fibromyalgia; that was diagnoses in 2000. As of now, my systolic bp is still high with frequent readings in the 170's.  What I specifically want to address is that the side effects of this medication has had a devastating effect on my carefully balanced pain management.   The swelling of the hands and feet has brought on almost constant pain in my wrists and hands.  Sleep is always an issue with fibromyalgia, and this drug only adds to those issues; I also certainly did not need help with my depression.  I am so tired and in so much pain.  After appointments with my family practitioner and my rheumatologist this week, they are working together to on how to satisfactorily manage both my bp and my pain level.  I think this drug needs some careful study on its interactions in patients diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome.    ",2

Painful and very uncomfortable.  Sure it lowered my blood pressure, but I don't think the side effects were worth it!  Looks like I have elephantitus or something!!  ",4

Other factors must be considered as other meds. taken, B.P. II med. Lamotrigine was cut in half last 2 weeks also.  Stress factors also need to be considered.  Must find way to reduce them (yoga, tai-che, mediation, diet, exercise) and then see if 10mg can be cut back to 5mg or zero!  Still have occasional tightness of chest at times.  Must take deep breaths for a minute or two, then I'm okay.  No real side affects noticed except very foul urine stench, and being 'bound"" up.  I've forced myself to drink more fluids to flush the med. and found 1 to 2 cups of hot tea, 2000mg vit C, 1000mg vit. E further helped to reduce ""foul"" urine stench.  Added more dark leafy veg's. to keep looser.  Other than that, it is easy to take, 1 pill in the am.  Hopes this helps some reading this.",4

I had taken this drug for 2 years. My feet started to swell after about a year but I did not attribute this to this drug because I'm on other meds.

Best to have a cardiologist do the fine tuning on BP meds and not leave to a GP. Felt it was working well in conjunction with Benezepril med and dissipating some of my mild stroke symptoms. Doing hese meds in conjunction with largely fruits and veges diet, weight loss and 30 minutes per day brisk walk on treadmill...",4
I have been taking this medicine for 2 years and over the past year I had lots of problems with swelling in my legs & a rash. I was given creams and Bactrim for the rash but it continued to get worse. I was given Lasix & potassium for the swelling but it continued so after stress tests & an echocardiogram & a ultrasound for blood clots which all came back negative...My Dr. increased the Lasix & potassium to the point my blood pressure bottomed out & I felt horrible so I quit taking all of these but I continued my Cozaar until I went back to my Dr. today. My rash is clearing up and my swelling has went down so now my doctor tells me that this drug may have caused all my problems. I wonder how long he would have taken to figure this out if I hadn't quit this drug by myself? ,3
I have had gum surgery (gingivectomy surgery) and will have the third surgery due to this calcium channel blocker.  It worked great for the blood pressure but not for the gums.  When I mentioned this to the pharmacist he knew exactly what I was talking about.  I will go on an ace inhibitor for blood pressure and then have my lat gum surgery. ,3

I had, on 4/19/12, complained that the amlodipine, which I'd taken for at least 2 yrs, wasn't working. I complained that my BP hadn't marginally improved, and that the medication caused bloating. Well, my Dr, at my request, put me back on Metoprolol (50mgs)beginning on 6/7/12. To date, I've lost 17 lbs, the bloating has disappeared, and, most important of all, my BP has has lowered significantly. I feel SO MUCH BETTER! Best of luck to all of you for continued good health!

The doctor has changed my meds around so now I am taking an increased dose of Cozaar and this medicine at night along with Clonidine.

My feet and ankles swelled so they were almost deformed and the skin was shiny.  I was on vacation when the worst of this hit and it nearly ruined my trip.

Though I have had them throughout most of my life, I have suffered severe daily, debilitating migraines for a year straight now with absolutely no relief from the pain, as well as any or all of the other symptoms that come along with my migraines. Every medicine that I've tried has not helped, the strongest pain medicine only taking the edge off & allowing me an hour or 2 of sleep, If I was lucky. It has been just about 2 months since I started on this & my doctor & I have decided to try removing some of the others, beginning with Topiramate/Topimax & then we will try taking me off some of the pain medicine & I am hoping to not have to use anything other than my Immitrex nasal spray, but my insurance only covers 6 (20mg) per month. I was told that I may have to have my dosage of Amplodipine raised soon but I am on a very low dose & it is apparently not given often for migraines. So far, this is working very well for me & I have faith that it will continue to work. ~ I'll keep updating as time passes & I truly hope that this is helpful for some people going through the same issues.",4

Going to start on more exercise.  Then maybe I can stop any of these BP meds.  They all have roughly the same side effects.  Years ago, when first diagnosed with HBP, was taking Tenorhetic.  Loved that one, absolutely no side effects with Tenorhetic, going to talk to doc about switching to it again, if it's still available.",4

Didnt seem to think it is meds since I told her that I had been taking acai berry concentrate in my water daily.  After reading this post, I know it is the meds--because I was taking acai berry before medication with no problems.  Anyway, I will refrain from both.  I have tried two other medications--experienced uncomfortable side effects.  Oh yeah, also have weight gain and stomach bloating.  I hope to find a natural alternative.

Fingers are so bad that I could barely get my rings off. Keeping rings off until the meds get out of my system. The swelling in my face and neck is slight--but odd and uncomfortable.

I can do the math.",2
since starting this medicine i started to have problems with breathing and shortnest of breath,1
"Started 1 month ago on 10mg Amlodipine, 10 mg Lisinopril, and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for scary high BP. My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups!   I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal.  I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite.   My goal is through weight and diet management to be able to get off the medications completely. I'm still about 20 lbs too heavy so I'm working to lose the extra lbs. Hopefully that will normalize my BP and allow me to be medication free. Wish me luck!  ",4

I finally decided maybe it was the amlodipine,  remembering back to the timing of when I began taking it and when the headaches started. So, I was anxious to look at this site and read others experiences with this drug. I want to thank everyone for sharing.  It is so helpful to know I am not the only one having these awful headaches. I am also having some bladder problems  which I had not associated with this medicine before reading the reviews.  I will stop this medicine tomorrow, maybe I can get my life back.  ",3

I'm so confused and in such pain. Effects my ability to stand, cook, walk, or function & I'm tired as heck. Will try the new heart med enalapril for 2 more days if no improvement, off to ER. Not a diabetic and only other med I take is for high cholest.  Need to function and get to the root of this problem! ",3
"Started taking this drug 1 month ago because Hyzaar 100/25 caused me to cough which affected my vocal cords. For 2 weeks felt good and had energy. after 1 month feet, ankles and leags are swelling. Taking this drug with 25mg of HCTZ also. My husband takes Amlodipine and does well, but this drug is not for me. Cost is very reasonable. Now have samples for Tekturna ugh oh, here I go again.Its an expensive drug too.",3
"I have been taking this med for 4 days and have experienced itching and stinging of the skin, loose stools, frequent urination at nite, severe abdominal pain and some joint pain. I am trying to stick it out because I have tried so many blood pressure meds in the past the Dr. is about tied.",3
"I was on 2.5mg until two days and now on 5mg. Yesterday I had a very bad headache and felt bad until late evening(better after taking pain releivers). Today I have an upset stomach and feel horrible. Going back to 2.5mg tomorrow on my own to see if this stops (nurse said give it a week). No problems with swelling. Don't know if weight gain over the last year is the medicine or me, trying to eat better and exercise.",2
"After reading the posts, I realize why my ankle swelling won't come down even taking lasix (furosemide) doesnt help reduce the water retention.I take in the AM a 325 aspirin, Diovan HCT 325, Metoprolol 100 mg, Clonidine 0.1mg. In the PM, Clonidine 0.1, amlodipine besylate 5mg. I love to walk and have had no problems walking or with any of the medication execept when the Metoprolol was increased to 100 from 50 a month ago. Now experiencing some light headedness when I bend over to tie my shoes. And the water retention is bad. I drink lots of water and the more I drink, the better I do elimnating excess water. I take the lasix only very ocassionally because it does not help. ",1
"began taking 5mg on June 4, 2011. Today is June 25 had headaches at first, then seemed okay. Hot flashes began and now feet are swelling and legs feel hot and aching. Seems like shortness of breath. Body feels swollen, calling dr Mon.Was on Hyzaar and did not have these same side effects",3

"Taking it in the evening seems to help me sleep better.  So far, no severe side effects.  Take the 5 mg Amlodipine and changing my eating habits lowered my BP considerably.  Also, try to eat a banana several times a week to prevent leg cramps.  It's worked so far. ",5
"This was added with my existing blood pressure pill and my counts have been in the normal range for the past 3 months.  I do have some dry mouth during the night, but during the day, everything is back to normal.  ",5
"Have High blood pressure, am diabetic, had triple bypass that was failure, now have 8 stents.

I sleep well every night I did not know I had a heart, now I can feel my heart beating with a nerveness.",1
"I've only taken it for a week but plan to discontinue immediately.  Most of the side effects described here, I have experienced.  It doesn't seem worth trading my moderately high blook pressure for a whole long list of undesireable side effects.  Thanks for your open comments.",3
"The side effects seem to outweigh the benefits. They include depression, nightmares, light headedness, swelling of ankles, dry mouth, dry eyes and vision problems.",2
I have been on many different kinds of blood pressure medicines and so far this has worked the best.,4
The most common side effect I've noticed in my patients is regular tachycardia or fast rate arrhithmia. Very seldom I've to change medication for another option,3
Dont feel as though Ive been taking this med long enough to give an accurate description with my experience and the treatment.,3

Had swollen ankels, severe case of hives and rash.severe headaches,muscle cramps in my calves. heart palpations insominia. thought I was going to die from all the side effects.  took myself off 2 days ago. hope i don,t get any problems. but all my tests claim my heart is in excellent condition. anyone have any problems from just stopping on your own.  I know my Dr. will ber mad when I go Back. Going to try to keep pressurte down the natural way. This medicine should be outlawed!!!",1
I love this medication.  It mellows me out and makes me feel so good.  It has helped my blood pressure return to normal.  I take it with two other blood pressure meds.  Together they have been wroking great for me.  I wondered why I had gotten mild cramping.  Although0 that's a small price to pay for what it does for me.  ,5
It has been very effective in controlling my b/p. I initially stated out on 5 mg. and was increase to 10 mg. I am now back on 5 mg. I also take metoprolol,5
I dont take this drug in the afternoon due sleeping mode that cause my work ineffective. ,2
"After beginning taking this drug, I had problems with my legs, the calf muscles became so weak that I could hardly go to the store, mailbox, etc., they felt as if they just could not go any further and bad headaches became common, and if I became upset, which happened much more frequently than ever before, the headaches were bad and mild confusion developed.  Then, a couple of weeks ago, having developed an upper respiratore infection, the blood pressure was up, and the dr. prescribed another does per day of this which made it 5 mgs. in the morning and 5 mgs. at night.  My legs got much worse, ankles were swollen, behind knee was swollen, eyes were puffy, and bad headaches.  Went to my doctor and we have decided not to take this medicine and will check back with him in one month.  I feel this is a very dangerous drug for some people, we cannot all take the same drugs.",1
"I took this drug for 4 days felt very bad had fast heart beat and felt like it was beating out of my chest. Also had hot flashes, and never had before. ",1
"Dr. had me on lisinipril and amlodipine.  She took me off lisinipril because of cough, back pain and added tekturna. No symptoms but blood pressure didn't go down enough. Seemed to get nose bleeding once tekturna added, but dr. doesn't think bleeding is associated with medicine. Then she added Losartan and I am still experiencing nose bleeding.  Anyone else experience this?",4
"I have been on amlodipine for several months, for high blood pressure.  I got severe headaches which I thought was a sinus infection and I was very weak.  I took antibotic's and when that didn't help.  I went to an ENT. Had a CAT scan done sinus were fine, but I still had headaches and extreme fatigue.  I looked up this medication on google and there were all the side effects.  I stopped taking it immediately.  Back to my old peppy self and no more headaches.  I will never take this drug again.  If it work's for you take it, but if you have one side effect, call your doctor and asking your doctor to change medications.  It doesn't get better it gets worst.  ",2

"I have been on this medication for a year and it brought my blood pressure down to normal, when no other drug would do that.  The only side effects are slight swelling and flushing to feet.  I take a diuretic to counteract the swelling.  Now I notice my gums are swelling.  I believe the circular that came with the medication stated a side effect is gum overgrowth that should be reported to a dentist.  I am planning to see my dentist soon, and will ask my doctor if it is time to change this medication to another one.",5
I went from 5MG to 10MG and I feel tired and depressed and dizzy and a little quezzy,2

Taking for migraines. Started taking 5mg but still had migraines. Doctor increased to 10mg. I haven't had a migraine in a little over a month. I was having an average of 10 migraines per month. This is 1st medicine in over 10 years that has helped me. Only problem I have is the swollen legs/ankles/feet. I'm sure I'll have to stop taking it soon and go back to the headaches. It was nice while it lasted...,5

Libido and desire yes....but absolutely no errection.  Dr said it's not meds probably my age (52) I'm don't agree.  Also have been feeling tired with flu like symptoms.

"2.5mg daily, on it for 45 days, for occasional angina. After 3 weeks the angina has now virtually disappeared. Even with much increased low level excercise. BP has not changed, still 130/65, I take other meds for that. Major side effect - Very tired, all the time, every day.   Sometimes minor - dizziness, nausea, head pain, stiff muscles, weight gain.  One irregular heart beat. ",3
"Family doctor started Tenorectic and then added Amlodipine, both for high blood pressure.   Dosages were at the lowest level.   After Amlodipine was added, the side effects included a “boiling soup” sound and sensation in my stomach, alternating constipation and diarrhea, tarry stools, stinging, burning and pain going to the bathroom, weird sensation in mouth in morning, hot flashes and sweats, flushing, irregular heartbeat, etc.  After enduring the side effects for too long,  a cardiologist eliminated the Amlodipine. The side effects were gone within days, except for the stinging and burning going to the bathroom.  Six months after the Amlodipine was stopped,  an endoscopy showed a healing ulcer in my stomach.  The periodontist  may need to surgically fix the receding gums.   A  colonoscopy was clean.  As of this date, the burning sensation, abdominal pain and the tarry stools, have not occurred since the colonoscopy.",1
"Switched from Lisinopril to this 5g medicine.OK at first but now have large swelling in my calfs,""crawling"" all over my body,rash on my legs. urinating all night,no energy and a dry mouth. Very unhappy with the side effects.",2

"I was prescribed this medication back in 2001. The first thing that happened was swelling of my ankles. My doctor told me not to worry, its a side effect. After being in this drug for 6 mos. I never felt good and sometimes had palpitations after taking it. I weaned myself off of it and refuse to take it. Wish doctors understood how hard it is dealing with side effects. Oh, and I developed a horrible rash just on my lower legs and even though I no longer take this drug, the rash never went away. ",2
Two words : Hair Loss !,3
Horrible hair loss and swelling of ankles and feet.  Swelling of gums?  Not sure if that is from the med.,3
"Started having nose bleeds, legs & feet swelled. am not happy with this drug",2
"I HAS COUSED MY FEET, ANKLES AND LOWER LEGES TO SWELL A LOT. I JUST CALLED MY DOCTOR TO SEE IF THEY CAN TAKE ME OFF OF IT AND USE SOMETHING ELSE.",3
"Dr. put me on this medication first at 5mg then when that didn't work 10mg. Even with the other two rx I am on, Diovan and Lasix, my BP is still high; but within two days I was itching. Now after two months I can hardly function because I am too busy clawing at my skin until it bleeds. Even benedril doesn't work. I am done with this stuff.",1
erectal dysfunction,5
"I suffer from Tachycardia, at times. Supplements(Drenamin, Withania) have toned it down. Metrolopol is still needed PRN, and works! Good luck ",4
"I have used this for 8 months , the only side effect I have noticed is dry mouth . I see some saying they have had sexual side effects , I have had none , if anything my wife has said I have more energy !",4
"I take this medicine along with Diovan HCT for high BP. I appear to have experienced a lot of the same side effects as reported by other users. Sexual dysfuntion, leg/ankle swelling, urinating multiple times during the night, dry mouth, reduced energy levels. Not really satisfied, been taking this medicine for a long time, and am going to speak with MD about the alternatives.",3
Abnormalities: excessive urination; leg cramps.,4
I'm an asthmatic and since I started taking this pill my asthma has worsened. I would have to stop and rest 2-3 times to go to the road to get my paper and mail. I am extremely dizzy and can't bend over to put the clothes in the dryer. When I cough I get dizzy and almost fall over. I've also gained at least 25 pounds since I started taking this pill and I bruise extremely easily. My arms hurt so badly I asked my husband to massage them and now I look like I've been beaten! The FDA must re-evaluate this medication because of the excessive amount of side effects. I'd rather have the high blood pressure than the terrible side-effects of this pill. ,2
I have had the dry cough and my sinuses are very dry with some low level of pain.,3
"Started taking this for high BP. Was switched from Lisonapril/hydrochlorizide due to side affects. This one was worse I have been on it for 5 days, 3 MINI- migranes tired, weak, flushed face, No libido, Erictile dysfunction and general lousy feeling, hip pain. A freind is also on this and he is just tired all the time. Be aware of side affects that you do not dismiss them as old age or the flu.",3
I was taking 5 mg. daily and this dosage was not controlling my blood pressure and the dose was increased to 10 mg daily. After 2 months suddenly my ankles and feet began to swell to the point that I was in pain. The medication was discontinued and immediately the swelling disappeared.,3
"I have taken this drug for several years, but now hve  a dry  cough.Do I change the medication again--as I had to do 4 yrs. ago with another drug?",3
"Have been taking 10mg dose for several months. In the beginning it did a good job of controlling my blood pressure with no other side effects. Now I am experiencing a few. Considerable swelling of ankles and feet are the biggest concern now. Sometimes I feel bloated, like I'm retaining fluid. I urinate almost every hour all night long. Tough to get a good nights rest. My sex drive is almost zero. (yes there is sex after sixty :) Oh, and my ears itch. Strange, but true. My blood pressure is still good (115-120 over 75) But I know I have gained at least 10-15 lbs of water weight. Is there a diuretic pill that can be taken with this drug to counteract the fluid retention? I feel like a water balloon!",5
I get an upset stomach if I take it everyday.  I take it every other day and and I'm OK,5
"Was having high blood pressure, plus potassium and calcium deficiency, this was prescribed, now am having swelling behind knees and knees and muscles in back of legs get weak at lots of times.",1
"So I've been taking 5mg every day for about 3 weeks.  Biggest problem is that I'm having severe heart palpitations/fluttering - usuall when I'm lying down at night.  It was so scary last night that I slept with my clothes on...just in case.  No swelling, but have had really bad cramping in my right calf muscle for two days now.",2
went from 2 5mg to the one 10 mg and blood pressure shot back up again.Different mfg.,1
Makes me feel awful,2
"I've been using it for 1 month now and it seems to work on lowering my B.P, but it is making my feet and ankles swell. ",4
"I took this medicine for High BP, while it has lowered my BP, it hasn't lowered it enough. In addition I am experiancing extreme leg and muscle pain. While easy to use, it's one of those meds you can't just stop taking when you don't like it, you have to be weened off, I'm not comfortable with that. I have found several natural remedies that I will be switching to as soon as my doctor gets me off this crap. ",3
"I switched from Lisinopril 20 mg. to 2.5 mg of Amlodipine. Blood pressure stays around 110/78. Also taking HCTZ, so no swelling noticed in legs & feet, although I am gaining weight. I got very ill after drinking a daily ounce of pomegranate juice with my medication: severely low BP (at lowest point, 79/58), dizziness and shortness of breath.  I drank pom juice with meds for 3 days and the effect has been like an overdose. DO NOT DRINK POMEGRANATE JUICE WITH AMLODIPINE!  It is like grapefruit juice and can be toxic!   It has been 6 days since I have been off my meds and my BP is staying low (109/77) and still dizzy.  I can't walk for long periods of time and have to stop for a few minutes to catch my breath and control the dizziness.  Hoping that the effects will dissipate soon and I can get back to normal.  I am drinking cranberry juice to help detox my liver and kidneys.  It seems to be helping, but I had like 15 days worth of meds in my body.  ",4
"Started on 5mg but was not effective.  Dr. Increased to 10mg & it brought it down to normal to boarderline range but I am not convinced my BP is as low as it should be.  As for side affects - some swelling though not too bad.  No real pain/itching/rashes to mention, I do have dry mouth & urinate a couple times a night (but this was occurring before the med), no erection or sexual performance problems either.",3
"I have been on this medication for over a year.  It has helped lower my blood pressure, along with another med for high b.p. Unfortunately, it is beginning to cause my ankles and feet to swell.  This also is a side effect of the other blood pressure medicine.",3
"Dont know if this drug is causing my problems, but will stop taking it today.Has lowered my blood pressure, altho I now have swelling in my feet and legs, very hard breathing cant walk to mail box and back with out stoping to rest, doctors put me on oxygen but it dont seems to help, yes I have copd.  Only started noticing these problems after starting taking these pills 2 1/2 months ago, they have run ever kind of test you can think of but dont have any answers except to do more tests. Have also a hard time peeing but sleep the whole night with out having to get up. have body pain all over and unable to do anything with out being worn out.  will see if these pills are the problem and report",3
This medication causes swelling in my legs and ankles.   I was so afraid I stopped taking it after a week. This medication is a poor substitute for Felodipine ER 10 mg.  There should be warning listed on the medication.,1
since i took this medication it has lowered my high blood pressure. ,3
I have not taken this med yet. I was on lisinopril for 3 days and made me VERY sick. Stopped taking it and was fine the very next day. The doctor put me on this today and after reading reviews decided not to take it. The thing is that I went to the doctor for a rash on my leg and they never even adressed that now they have me taking all kinds of tests and taking meds for high blood pressure. How do they know I have high blood pressure if it was the first time they have taken my pressure. You cant make that judgement by one time. Time to find a new doctor. By the sounds of things I think the doctors are getting a kickback for prescribing this med. Well they are not getting my $$$.,1
"I have been on this medication for some time in addition to taking Diovan HCT 320/12.5 which is a combination blood pressure and water pill. I would take the Amlodipine 10mg in the evening and the other in the AM hours. I too had attributed my aches and pains etc. to getting older, however after reading all 274 Reviews I believe this medication is responsible for most of my problems.. No sex drive, weight gain, crazy dreams that make no sense at all, swollen feet/ankles and legs, feeling that my throat was narrowing, making it noticable to swallow, dry itchy skin, pain in my left shoulder and neck, getting up 2-3 times during the night to tinkle,inability to get to sleep or sleeping for 4-6 hrs a night,thinning hair, dry eyes and mouth, heart palpations which caused my cardiologist to feel that I needed a pacemaker, which I have had now for one year.(Wonder if I really needed that). Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too. I'll keep you guys posted.I hope everything gets better for everyone.  I'm starting to feel Gr-r-r-eat!! ",2
Been on this medication for a month doctor added this to my Lisinopril/Hydrochloride i became weak and my breathing got really bad i do have copd but this made it worse. i stopped taking this medication and i'am back to my normal self well almost copd isn't normal but least i can move around now.,1
I had a severe allergic reaction to Amlodipine. My head was pounding and it felt like my body was on fire.  My entire body was red with hives.  I do not recommend this drug to anyone.,1
"dizzy. headache,",3
I had swelling in feet and legs.  I gained 24 lbs of water weight in 3 weeks.  Could not urinate and still can not maintain an erection.  On it two weeks now off it two weeks.  Went to the Dr. felt like I was going to explode.  Have to go see a specialist.  Ultra sound found my abdomen is filled with water.  Nose bleeds as well.  Horrible.  May have done significant damage to my body.  Do not recommend at all!,1
makes me feel sad. ,3
Eye twitching,4
I just started it today.,3
Started on 5mg. There was little change.  The Dr. increased to 10mg. My legs and ankles swelled and became blotchy.  Dr. prescribed water pill. Swelling continued to increase and a fevered redness spread over ankles. The Dr. than prescribe an antibiotic to help infection and stop the HP prescription. The infection got worst in three days and I had to go to ER. I was in hospital for 6 days. I do not have diabetes or poor circulation. For me this was not the drug. I can't recommend.,1
I have been taking this drug for a year now. only side effect for me is slight dizzyness.,5
  When I had a severe alergic reaction to Lisinopril my doctor switched me to this medication.  It in conjunction with Clonidine has done me very well.  Although I have had very bad swelling in my feet and ankles after taking this.  My doctor added Furosemide (Lasix) and it has helped considerably.,5
"I was taking lisinpril for over 10 years, when I started experiencing a dry cough(which I believed to be my asthma).  Dr. insisted it was my lisinpril and switched me to amlodipine.  I have been taking it for 6 weeks now.  Cough stayed(no surprise) but now I have swollen ankles, feet, dry month, excessive thrist, and am up every 2 hours during the night going to the bathroom along with the cough. Dr. hasn't taken my blood pressure since he switched my meds.  Maybe time for a new DR.",3
I have been using amlodipine to steady my heart and lower my blood pressure. I have heart disease for 20 years....this medicine makes my saliva bitter that makes all foods taste terrible. I suck on Halls menthol cough drops.,4
"I have been taking this medication for about 10 years, it has been doing me good.",5
"Not as good as the brand name ""Norvasc"".",1
my blood pressure run about 160 over 106. but sent they gave these pills. i'm steel cold all the time.,3
IT WAS EFFECTIVE BUT I WAS TAKING IT IREGULARLY,4
GOOD,5
Dr. stated I had pre hypertension. Put me on Lisinopril but stopped taking it after constantly coughing day and night. Switched to Amlodipine Besylate 5mg one a day and now have red blotches over both arms and legs with cripling pain in back and arms that appeared after two weeks on Amlodipine. Went to my Dr. but had to be seen by a Nurse Practicioner who stated it was not a side effect of the medicine. Was all of this just a coincidence? I thinking of stopping the Amlodipine myself to see if it all clears up. (or change Drs),1
it doesn't cure the pulpatation,3
have been on several bp meds nothing worked for me doctor put me on  amlodipine 5 mg didn't work increased it to 10 mg works great bp never looked better no side effects at all am overall satisfied with this med.,5
"Have had muscle ache in legs, hair thinning, rashes on lower legs, poor concentration, very dry skin, less control over my anger, somewhat depressed (not my usual sunny-self). Absolutely zero libido. Dr. keeps adding meds to lower BP    (Need a new dr, not more meds)",4
did nothing to lower my blood pressure,1
"Lowered my BP to a normal range. First couple of days I felt slightly dizzy, but that went away after a couple of days. Beats having a stroke! It`s the only medicine I`m on. I`m back to surfing regularly! : )",5

"unable to obtain an erection, or upon manual stimilation of my penis, unable to maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse",3
"The immediate side effects was swollen ankles and feet within 1 week. Later tingling in my throat, frequent urination at night, dry mouth, thrist, and the over all bad feeling.  I thought I was the only one with these side effects.  But after reading others problem with the drug, I am going to discontinue using immediately.  Thanks everyone for the information.  We all have to stick together. ",1
"Amlodipine 5mg is poison for me. I stopped taking it after a month because of the following symptoms: severe flu-like pains with aches in my limbs,nausea with dry heaving, feeling like I got run over by a bus, trembling, endless hot flashing. My doctor said that these sysmptoms are not from Amlodipine but after reading all the comments I beg to differ.   Two days after I stopped using it I still feel bad but not as bad. The nausea is finally subsiding.This stuff is not for me. I would rather have high BP and then live in misery. Way to go Pfizer.",1
"Yesterday, I reported all was fine after 6 days.  I was wrong.  Last night I experienced some pain in rt side of my heart and immediate indigestion on rt side, further below the heart.  I sat up all night, as it makes me feel better.  Feeling achiness in rt chest.  Have call into cardiologist for something different!",1
"I have been taking this medicine for two months now. BP has come down slightly. Side effects are very dry mouth, constant sore throat and cough. However since I started this medicine I want to eat everything in sight. I can't stop eating. I felt better before I started this medicine.",3
"I have been using this medication for almost a year now.  I developed serious side effect on the drug - hives, hot rashes in between filings.  But after talking to the pharmacist and switched between a couple other manufacturers, I was able to settle on one of them.  If you are experiencing the same problem, you should have your pharmacy switch the manufacturer to see if it helps.  It takes me a couple month to find the right one.",3
"I'm writing this because of my mother's problems with it. She had it in the past and was taken off due to bad side effects, then was on it again in Azor, and  now is on it alone again. She just went through a spell where she almost completely lost control of her mind. She could not do simple tasks. Her memory was all over the place and she'd get her mind on one thing and not be able to let it go and her worrying was through the roof. Now that she's on norvasc alone, she's sliding again. She is having to urinate frequently, especially at night, so she loses sleep, plus insomnia is a side effect, so the combination is taking her health down. Her doc tried to convince me it was old age. Sheesh! She has many other side effects listed for it as well. ",3

"Being on this drug for about 1 month and checking my bp every day, I find that my upper pressure is high (146) and my lower pressure is better (75).  Shouldn't the upper number be lower?  I really don't think the drug is working correctly.",3
it lowes my blood pressure,5
diziness,3
I just started this medication about a week ago.. After reading all of your comments about weight gain.. and leg pain I am considering stopping the meds myself. I am experiencing leg pains and a dizziness that is crazy. I feel high as a kite for hours. I have not seen any swelling but I feel so tired. I didnt take these pills for one whole day and I feel much better without them. I have not been testing my blood pressure at home but I can feel when it goes up and down. I too have had crazy psychotic dreams off and on. It was scary. Taking the pills at bedtime helps u sleep through the  side effects if u take it earlier enough. Oh yeah and I too have night sweats. I dont trust medications AT ALL.. and this one I am not sure I am sticking with either..,3
tiredness,4
"right ankle swelling is worse since doctor put me on this med.  I am going to ask her to take me off of this med.  Don't like it at all, plus reports that it has been reviewed by FDA for recall. ",1
"Doc replaced Lusinapril with this, after 3 months, BP is a little bit lower, have had neck swelling, and itching, chest pains, wild dreams (dont mind them too much yet), loss of sex drive and cant really find out what symptoms to expect. Thought I was having a stroke or something one time.  Im going to change when I take the pill, 5MG, mabe it is too much.  Have leg pain and I have gained at least 10 LBS since starting.  Eat right and work hard every day.  Bp fluctuates frequently and wake up with fast heart beat and soaking wet frequently.  Can any one tell me if there is a better med?  I just dont feel good sometimes.",2
Toss into hypertension because of surgical menopause.  Never had it before.  Took this med which did not work.  Made a mistake and had grapefruit with it and I felt like I was going to have a stroke.  The maker of this med did not mention that grapefruit should not be eaten with it.,1
It has reduced my high blood pressure. It has caused excessive swelling in my left foot with large red skin rashes from above ankle to toes and same for right foot ut but less swelling,4
My BP daily ranges 110 to 130 top number and 70 to 84 bottom.  I am having such dreams that make me wake up to make sure it isn't real!  Anyone know if this ends?,3
Lowered my Blood pressure also I was able to get an erection!,4
Treatment is effective but causes foot swelling. I find that my dose needs to be smaller than the current smallest provided dose allows(5mg)so cut about 1mg off a tablet,4
Had to increse the dose to 2.5 and increase weight gain immediately. Going to bathroom several times at night and through the day.  does anyone else have these problems? ,2
"Note to ""Not Feeling Well:"" My advice is get a new Dr. before this one kills you with over medication! Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion.  After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition.  Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.",4
But am having trouble with the gerneric  norvasc. I want to know if there is corn used as a filler in the pill. I;m very allgeric  to corn. I've brrought out in lips sore and open soree and icheyeyes and have knose bleeds which I haven;t had for years. I've been on the Norvasc 5 mm for over 6 years and no trouble. So hope you can me the ingreints in this pill. thanks,2
Lisinopril made me cough; a diuretic didn't work.  Amlodipine was just the ticket.  I had a slight swelling of the ankles initally but since I've cut way back on  bread and other starches the swelling has disappeared. My moods have leveled off also.,5
"I have been on this drug for abt 2 months. It seems to be effective in lowering my bp, but my biggest concern is excessive thirst throughout the day and getting up every 2 hours at night to urinate. Also have experienced wacky dreams most nights. The past 2 weeks my ankles are swollen at end of day and have red blotches on them. I also have more problem with lower back pain.",5

"The prescribed 5mg did not keep my blood pressure within range.  I tried taking 5 mg twice a day and that evened things out.  When I took 10 mg once a day, my systolic was out of range at the end of the 24 hour period. I was waking up with a systolic above 80 (resting rate) and a headache.",1
"I started taking this medication for high blood pressure that started after menopause.  It has lowered the blood pressure but I am having severe hot flashes, fat legs, ringing in my ears and fatigue.  I am considering stopping the medication.  I went through the hot flashes with menopause, and before I took this med I had none.  Now they are back.  I exercise everyday, eat right, and have always had to work to keep my weight down, and I am very uphappy that this medication is working against me.  I am thinking of going of off the med and seeing what happens with the blood pressure.  ",5

"Taking 10 mg/day along with lisinopril 20 mg in morning and 10 mg at night.  My blood pressure is much improved.  However, despite no decreased sex drive, I am having problems getting and keeping an erection.  I don't know if it is this drug, or the lisinopril, or the combination of both.  Doctor says neither, but I disagree.  Anyone else with same problems?",4
"My Doctor first started with 10mg of Bisoproplol,20mg of Lisinopril and 10mg of hctz. After not having very good results he increased my dosage to the same Bisopropolol, 40mg of lisinopril,25mg of HTCZ and included 80mg of Lipitor and 5mg of Amlodipine I always feel bad, I have a cough, I get really nausiated and shaky, I can't sleep.

Last 2 months increased dosage to 5 mg 2xday which immediately decreased my chronic angina without decreasing my BP.  My BP runs low normally and never had high BP.   With increased dosage have noticed  numbness in lips/gum tenderness and these discomforts are increasing.  May return to 1xday to verify reactions caused by increase in amlodipine and then decide if the benefit of less chronic angina is  worth the lip numbness/tender gums.  Will consult with cardiologist/PA.  Also taking metoprolol and ranexa for angina along with aspirin, plavix, pravastatin, zoloft, stool softner, alprazolam, temazepam, multivitamin and iron supplement.      ",5

My doc says there's nothing in the drug that I can be allergic to (I'm allergic to sulfa), but can't I be allergic to the drug itself?  I stopped taking it, but the hives haven't subsided.  Wonder how long it takes to get out of your system?",3
"My doc put me on Amlodipine after HCTZ gave me hives and Lisinopril/HCTZ gave me a cough.  It may be working for my BP, but I am once again covered with hives.  I have found out that one of the side effects is hives, although my doc says there's nothing in the drug that I could be allergic to.",3

"The medication's side effects were not described to me at all when they were prescribed; when I reported problems with edema in my fingers, lower legs/ankles/feet, and genitals, no indication was given that this medication might be the cause.  I also reported tingling/numbness of the feet (neuropathy) and again, no mention to me that this medication was causing the problems.  The same with severe lower-back pain when walking or moderate exercise.  I was sent to a vascular surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, and more--but not one of the doctors indicated all my problems might be related to amlodipine. I cut my pills in half, and began to see a marked, though not total, lessening of the problems.  However I'm sure the doctors would object.",3

For the past three weeks I have experienced swelling in my feet and ankles. Which happen to be one the side effects from this medication,3
I only use this drug after taking 20 mg of Ramipril and my BP is still high.  I took it last night and had very bad dreams.  I'm wondering if this is a side effect of the med.  I know that stress and what we eat has a lot to do with our BP levels.  Fatty and salty foods tend to cause my BP to jump.  Stress is my worst enemy.  Wish I knew how to get the stress down.  Tried everything.  I keep Amlodipine with me at all times.  I've tried several other meds that had bad side effects.  This site allows us to share info like this.  Thank you WebMD.,4

I had been on Amlodipine for a brief 2 weeks.  After hallucinating, I'm done with it.  I feel that I had an adverse reaction to it and have discontinued use.",1
"Started with 5mg, moved up to 10mg after a month or so, total treatment duration aprox. 3 month. Taken with a mild diuretic for the lenght of the treatment. Presently changed to a new medication within the group of ACE inhibitors called Benazepril at 20mgs plus the same diuretic. OK, back to Amlodipine: It does lower your bp but in my case with several side efects such as Lightheadedness, swollen ankles low libido and very poor tolerance for alcohol, those still persist, however some of the initial side efects such as insomnia, constipation and skin rashes were gone after the first week of use. Overall and effective med. to lower your blood pressure. Bottom line: I'm happier with Benazepril 20mgs with less side effects and a remarkable drop in blood pressure not even close to what I was able to achieve with Amlodipine.",3

Tried taking it at night and even taking half a pill but couldnt function & miserable for 12-14 hrs before it would start wearing down. I work at a busy office that requires me to be alert but had to miss 3 days due to these side effects. Gave them back to my doc this morning & asked her to dispose of them for me & go with another med. Havent taken it for the past couple of days and feel back to myself again. Am so glad to be off it.

My blood pressure is still high and since I've been taking the meds my ankles are swollen & I am constipated.  I have never had frequent problems with constipation.  My doctor gave me a prescription for lisinopril to take along with the amlopidine.

Before that I was on Sular 10mg for about 2 years but did not have any issue.  So far, my blood pressure has not drop a bit, still at 140/90 even with the medication, same as when I started.  Sometime even higher, especially during the day when the stress level (from work) is at its highest.  I will stay on it for a little bit longer to see if it actually works for me or I need a higher strength.  One thing I did see improvement is the side effects of hives.  I do not get the hives as frequent or as serveve, but it still exist.  (I have a full panel of blood tests for allegies, but ruled out all of them).   Other side effects are the same as Sular, such as dizziness, headache, lack of concentration at work, tired, having hard time falling to sleep, sudden fast heart beats, etc.  Overall, I did not find it to be very effective.",2

"Started on 5mg and cardio Dr. upped to 10mg a month ago.  Now I have swollen ankles and feet, leg cramps but has helped control BP.  Called Doc and he said take half of pill for two weeks.  I take it with diuretic.  Would rather try something else.",3

"I started using 5mg of Amlodipine once at night for the last month. The cardiologist decided to add this drug to the current Benicar Hct 40/25mg that I was taking once daily for a year to lower my BP some more. The first thing I noticed were the side effects listed for this drug: fatigue, lack of motivation, dizzyness and mental fog, and constipation. It does lower my BP, but I feel way too laid back to be productive at all. Last week an unusual tenderness and fluid buildup appeared on my left forearm. The next day it moved to my elbow and has caused my elbow to be tender and swollen. I will be calling the cardiologist to get off of the Amlodipine. I wish there was a drug out there that was good for you and actually made you feel good too! If you are sexually active or want to be, do not take this drug!",3

I now notice that my ankles are swelling and my skin itches, feels like its streching and my inner wrist itches also.  I thougt maybe it was the weather or something I ate or an allergy. Well after reading all the comments I think its the AMLODIPINE. Ive already tried 2 other BP medicine and don't want to change again but I'm uncomfortable specially with the swelling.  I will call my doctor tomorrow.",3
"Oh boy this one almost put me over the edge! I ached all over, was dizzy, nauseous, wanted to stay in bed all day, legs swelled and itched so badly that I scratched oozing sores in them.  Even my scalp itched terribly and oozed when I HAD to scratch.  I was so tired and depressed, at 74, thought I was just old.  My boys came to visit and asked what was wrong.  I said I'm just getting old and they said ""NO! get to the doctor!""  I quit taking it that day and began to feel better by the next day!  BP went up but so did my morale!!! Now on new drug.  Hope it works - couldn't be any worse!!  Life is good again!!!",1
"I have been taking this w/quinipril for about a 9 months. My ankles started hurting but a foot doc told me it was nothing. So I just lived with it until about 1-2 months ago I started getting some big swelling in my feet especially my left. Finally got into my doc today and he told me he was 95% sure it was because of this drug, so he took me off of it. I guess we will see in a few days.",5

AMLODIPINE I take it late at night when I go to bed and snack on crackers before taking it so it won't bother my stomach. HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE I do not take it at night because it wakes me up 2 or 3 times to urinate, so I take it in the morning. My blood pressure was 179/92 for the last two months its been pretty steady at 135/80. Hopefully it will go down more. The only side effects I experience is drowsiness with AMLODIPINE. ",4

"Dr. switched me off of benezepril to avoid incipient kidney problems (no technical explanation) to amlodipine 5 mg.  Daily, usually take at around midnight before sleep. My BP is lowered, and I have far fewer side effects than with previous meds but do have irregular sleep, mild nausea, some weakness in legs, and mild constipation on an irregular basis. This round of medication is the first in my life (age 71) and I don't know enough about side effects to worry over these symptoms.  Went 4 days and nights during travel without the meds (forgot to pack 'em) and felt great the whole trip.  Got back, resumed once daily intake, now have leg weakness, stomach upset, irregular sleep, and heavy eye mattering again.  None of those is fatal I guess, but there is discomfort when using amlodipine. I'm hoping to be off all meds altogether after a year's use of BP med, and first time ever watching dietary content.  It's disturbing and not in my lifestyle pattern to take anything.",4
"I haven't taken for one full month yet. It has lowered my B/P; I take 5MG, generic Amlodipine. Woke up with what looks like ""heat rash"". First on inner wrists, arms, then on to chest, abdomin, back, neck and spots over eye, behind ears. This rash is slightly raised, hot & itchy. Bendryl helped temporarily yet rash came back full force. Oatmeal bath did not help. I am irritated that Amlodipine seemed to help initially, now is rashy and I had to stop Lisinopril after BAD dizziness.  There has got to be a better way!! I'm gonna try the Hawthorne berries/Cayenne combo that a previous person mentioned.",3
"Since starting this med I have severe hot flashes and very bright red face, a hundred times in 24 hours. Also libido has dropped through the floor.",4
"I have been on Amlodipine for 3 months, along with Cozaar.  Since starting the Amlodipine, I now have swollen ankles, itchy rash on arms, chest, and back, and constipation. My blood pressure is not as low as I would like (132/68), and I really must get off of it and try something else. Cozaar had no side effects for me.  ",3
"I, too, am experiencing left-sided numbness and tingling. My ankles/feet swelled immediately after beginning treatment for which the PA prescribed Hydrochlorithiazide.  Also feel the flushing in my face at times.   ",4
"neck pain, perhaps medication lowering blood pressure too much red hot face that went away with Lisinopril and is back.  Do not like the way it makes me feel.",1
"After taking many differant medications for my condition, my Doctor finally got one that seems to work for me. It is not perfect but it seems to do the job better than anything I was taking before.",4
"dizziness side effect possibly lowers BP excessively, sit to stand",5
Caused nausea and swelling of ankles.,4
"Have feet and ankle swelling.  I don't know whether to stop it or not.  Also have a skin rash, but I don't know if it's from the AB or something else...Sigh...  ",4
Increase in urination,2
"ACID REFLUX!! Despite the doctors telling me it can't be, I never had a problem until I started on this,and now that I stopped, it has gone away thankfully.  Also, lots of dizzy spells and unusual head pressure.  BP was down for a few weeks, but then spiked up.  Too many side effects to deal with.",1
"Have been on amlodipine besylate 10mg along w/lisinopril 20mg. Worked great lowered bp from 160-173/100-103 to 117/79. Side effects outweigh the +'s...neck/shoulder ache, severe stomach pain. Stopped taking today and going to get another med. ",4
"I was put on 10 mg as B/P was 130 over 58. I can tell you if you want fat legs,feet and ankles then this is the med. to take. It did nothing to lower my B/P.",1
My feet and ankles swell,4
"BP still a little high, having problems with severe constipation, face & neck flushing, some dizziness & headaches.  If no improvement soon, will call Dr. to change....",3
I have been on this drug for 10 days and it has lowered my BP somewhat. My complaints are that it causes extreme constipation and hiccuping. My opinion is that the negative side effects out weigh any potential positive effects it might have. I am discontinuing the med.,4
i seem to have chronic headaches,3
"Diagnosed with vasculitis. On 450 mg of lubetalol, 10 mg Norvasc, 2.5 mg Rampril. Swollen legs, no libido. Switched to 1000 mg of magnesium chelate. Stopped Norvasc, swelling gone, bp down to 118/80. Bad reaction to the drug, there are alternatives. Check out Dr. Jay Cohen MD's. book The Magnesium Solution for High Blood Pressure.",3
I have been on this drug approximately one month and in the past week experienced swelling in the ankles and hot red blotchy areas on the face after the first hour of taking the pill (usually first thing in the AM).  The redness disappears later in the day.  Dr. does NOT think ankle swelling is from the drug and I beg to differ because never have I had swelling in the enkles - just seems likely that when a person starts taking a different drug and experience symptoms not evident previously - then DAH! This is not rocket science to equate new drug with never before afflictions!  I prefer NOT to take any drugs.  I am going to half the 10 mg. dosage and see if that helps or go off altogether.,3
130/81 not to low,2
easy morning small pill to swallow. my BP is wonderful,5
I have only been on this drug for 5 days and I hate it.My heart is pounding so hard it wakes me up at night.I do not know if it is lowering my BP or not but do not care for the way I feel.I can hear my heart in my head !,3
"I have been given this med for High Blood Pressure, It has lowered since I began taking it, But Iam Experiencing numbness & tingling in left side from my feet up to my arms-Anyone Else???",5
"Been on it a month.  BP droped from 175/80 to about 145/75.  But heavy fatigue - I could sleep 10 hours a day if I let myself.  Libido is gone, even when I try to have sex erections are hit and miss.  Ther'[s gotta be abetter way.  I see the Dr tomorrow",3

muscle weakness in legs painful feet making walkin difficult,4
This medicine has not worked very well on my blood pressure and caused severe pains in both of my legs. I have stopped taking it.,3
"My Husband has been taking Amlodipine 5mg, then 10mg for 2 years now.  I have watched my husbands health deteriorate and I blame it on this drug, and the dr who prescribed it and told him he would have to take it for the rest of his life.  3 visits to the drs office his bp was elevated, and he told him that he needed to go back on meds.  He didn't ask what was going on in his life or how he was feeling he just wrote the script and walked out.  My husband's demeanor changed for the worse, his libido is nil.  He sweats profusely and has gained 40 lbs in these 2 years and has added stomach problems to his laundry list of symptoms.  Istead of taking the meds away they add more.  His BP has been normal since he started taking the pills, it just goes up when he stresses out about having to go to the dr.  His legs are going bad and he has sciatica.  I believe that if they would take him off that Amlodipine he could get his health back.",2
"I was prescribed Atenolol by my ex-doctor when my hypertension was discovered. For almost two months, nothing positive to actually lower it happened. My new doctor advised me to switch to this drug after assessing my condition (43, F, semi-vegetarian, smoker, occasional drinker, exercise present in job). First 2 weeks into it were terrible - chest pains, racing heartbeat, neck stiffness and body pains. After that, everything went okay. From an average BP reading of 150-160/105-115 a day, it's now down to 125-130/85-90. My dose is only 5mg/day which I take every 8am. Quite effective, I think so. ",4
I feel much better after taking this drug.,5
"I was diagnosed with angina and high blood pressure.  Have been taking the medicine for 1 year now.  No episodes of chest pain at all.  The side effects are dizzy, heart races, very somewhat disoriented at times.  I need to discuss a change with the Docotor.  Told my husband that I did not understand what was going on with my body but something was out of wack....",5
"I used This drug (10mg) for about eight months.  It never lowered my BP. Recently I started swelling on my both feet.  After waiting for few days, thought it will go away, It got worst.  So I checked in with Doctoer and he mentioned the swelling was due to my BP medicine.  He immediately put me ona different medication.",1
 When I started taking Amlodipine one tablet 5mg about 8 PM daily I feel my self better and BP is around 135/90 compare with previous one of 185/105.     ,5
"This medication brought down my blood pressure, but I have no desire for sex, my skin is dry and itchy, especially my scalp and my hair is getting incredibly thin. I'll try to waite it out to my next doctor appt.",4
"I am taking it for 2 1/2 months.  Thought it was fine,  athough my blood pressure is not as low as it should be.  The other day I had to be rushed to the hospital, my left side was tingling from head to toe and getting numb.  I was diagnosed with a TIA, but I think it may have been the medication.  I am going to change. Has anyone else had this reaction?",2
Simple easy & cheap.,5
"Lowered my B.P. to acceptable levels. Caused shoulder pain, mostly in the left shoulder. Some ankle swelling and constipation.",4
"Extremely tired, legs ache, diarrhea, stomach pain, flu like symptoms.",1
My doctor added amlodipine to Avalide for high blood pressure.  It has been an excellent solution.  My only side effect was ankle swelling which was remedied by the addition of a diuretic to the Avalide.  ,5
"This medication made my ankles swell, my blood pressure is under control, its just my ankles are kinda fat",4
"It was effective in lowering my blood pressure, but the side effects were not worth it. Severe muscle cramps, vision problems and fatigue were my negative reactions. ",4
drug great but cant get it up anymore wife thinks its her gonna get on another drug tomorrow,5
What are the side effects?,4
I am taking [1] Lisinopril 40mg TAB & [1] Amlodipine Besylate 10mg TAB together daily for a couple of years and have had no side affects except for errectical dyfunction. So I give this a 5 star for controling the blood pressure but sex life has been nil.....,5
"I was first placed on this med.11/07 @5mg, it really stopped the chest pain,after 6 mo.s it had to be increased to 10mg. but i can walk a great distance,do heavy work,w/o any pain ! My only concern is whats next, I""m on the highest dose avail.?",5
"Feeling unwell,dizzines,painfull legs,",1
"My husband just recently (2 months ago)began taking amlodipine 5mg.  I am seeing a significant change (not good) in his normally calm and patient demeanor, and his sex drive is completely gone.  His anger and frustration is being directed at me.  I'll be calling his Dr. tomorrow, and hopefully, he'll prescribe something different before it's too late.",3
"This medication was prescribed to me by my cardiologist on 08/01/08.  At the time my BP was 156/102.  My cardiologist also recommended that I purchase a blood pressure monitor.  I used the blood pressure monitor today for the first time and my reading was 122/87.  This medication has drastically reduced my high blood pressure in a very short period of time.  Also, I haven't had any side effects.   Thank You...Hilda Zorrilla!",4
"After three weeks of use(once a day),  I have experienced an extremely painful swelling of my feet.  Very much like gout except it is not semsitive to touching.  ",4

"Prescribed for migraine 5 mg.  Some moderate effectiveness.  Side effects include itchy scalp, fatigue, and perhaps minor mood disturbance. ",2
"Began taking amlodipine after my accident in 2003 along with maxzide for blood pressure. Though it helped lowered my BP, it also caused swelling in my ankles, fatigue, and a severely decreased libido. Stopped taking it and replaced it with hawthorne berries and cayenne supplements. BP has been normal ever since and the side effects are gone.",4
I have had a very bad experience with this medication. I have been taking it for about 2 wekks and since then i have had severe chest pains very bad dizziness and fatigue. i read that the chest pains could be a sign of infection from the medication.,2

it makes me sick and out of sorts,1
"Taken this med (5 mg tabs,) plus Metoprolol 50 mg, for 5 months; it has lowered BP well. Recently my ankles have swollen. I started to reduce dosage to 2.5 mg, and hope that will solve the problem. ",5
How long does it take for the med to get working?  I have been on for 1.5 weeks,1
First dose caused severe headache; ankles swelled up after a week on the drug - never had swollen ankles in my life before this.,3
"I have been taking this drug for about 5 years. It worked well for me. However, lately I am having symptoms that I attribute to the drug. I have extreme-severe swelling in my feet, ankles and hands. I went to my doctor and I'm having a few additional tests performed and if there isn't anything else wrong, I am going to ask to switch to another medication.",4
"Pressure was 140/90 before. Hardly came down to 125/90 or so after 5mg for a year. All of a sudden (after a year), I started to have burning and itching sensations on my arms/face/legs and severe constipation. I requested a different drug yesterday and stopped it. Hoping that my rash and constipation goes away.",2
"Pill works great for BP but has left me with bad sholders and neck pain, also arms are very weak. Not going to take it anymore.",5
I had a very hard time controlling my blood pressure while taking lisinopril and atenolol since taking this medication this is the lowest its been in 2 years,4
"Side effects severe, even after 2 mos. of drug therapy.  Heart ""pounding"", irregular heart rate, and feeling VERY hot.  These symptoms seem to occur more so at night and are very bothersome. Dosage reduced from 5mg to 2.5mg after 3 days of 5mg/day dose. Symptoms continue after 2+ mos. of tx at 2.5mg.",1
"I was originally on a 5mg dose with no improvement in B.P. Switched to 10mg which improved B.P. but caused significant swelling in feet,ankles and calfs (and probably some weight gain). Have been taken off the drug entirely.",1

blood pressure under good control. Causes increased urination at night. Question if switch from Norvasc to generic Amlodipine is causing excess abdominal flatus?,5
It has been beneficial in relieveing peripheral neuropathy,5
"this medicine caused swelling in my throat, after taking it for 2 days, on the third day I was woken up with chest pains. something I haven't been bothered with in many years. this is not a good drug.",1
I'm taking this drug along with Atenolol since Oct 2007. Blood pressure has been normal (124/78) since. Now the last two months I've been experiencing ankle swelling along with red blotches/rash and has been getting worst as time goes by. I never had ankle swelling until I went on this medication. I will ask my doctor to change medication.,4
I developed severe heartburn with this drug and couldn't swallow any other meds or vitamins.,1
I have been using this medication for about 5 months now and I am suffering with an itchy rash(hives)since October. Have been seeing an allergist since December for the Hives and can not find the cause of the recurring itchy rash. Just did research on this drug and these are all side effects. I am calling my doctor in the morning for a new script of Norvasc which I have never had a problem with. This is a terrible medication to give someone. Please be careful with this medication.,3
"i have been using this drug for about 2yrs,not much change",2
"Before I took this medicine, my BP was around 140/95. I'm taking Amlodipine 5 mg with Ramipril 5 mg and Hydrochlorothazide 12.5 mg. I'm also a type 2 Diebatic and I'm taking Metformin slow release 500 my tablets. Now my BP is almost near normal. My blood sugar level is also well within limits.",4

Terrible redness on my face and legs.  The edema side effect is now a major problem.  I am requesting a new medication.,2
"I gave my husband, who is a stroke victim, this medication for about 2 months.  His face, neck, shoulders and upper chest turned red.  He seemed really dizzy and he was very constipated.  Laxatives did not help the constipation.  I stopped this medication, no more constipation and he seems to be feeling much better but the redness has not gone away.  I got a new medication for him, just started today, which has lots of side effects also.  Why can't we get medication without so many bad side effects?",2
"Have just been put on this medication,so have'nt been on really long enough to tell. Just started it on November8th,2007. Guess will see how it goes?Glad to be able to see Reviews on here on Medicines.",3

My high blood pressure has dropped significantly although I do feel tired a lot since being on this medication and after about 2-3 months my erections have really suffered. I've lost about 2 inches on my boner and I am no longer stiff as a board. It also takes a lot more for me to get an erection when normally I look at my wife and I'm standing at attention. This is very disappointing to me as I am still very sexually active. My wife says she doesn't notice a difference but I sure do.,5
Blood Pressure was not responding to my old medications and we switched to this combo.  Blood pressure was down from 160 to 115-120 in a matter to days.  Blood pressure is right where we wanted it to be for my age.  Very pleased with the results. ,5
"Have been on meds for hypertension for over 40 years. have taken many kinds. Was on amlodipine alone and no longer worked; went to higher dose but had lots of swelling on my feet. Switched to this and blood pressure dropped, no more swelling. No diuretic needed any more. Awesome!",5

"I took 5 mg at night.  Within two days I was feeling ""off"", not dizzy, but not totally together.  The longer I was on it the worse the symptoms got.  I had to pay attention to where I was placing my feet or I would get off kilter (indoors on flat floors), be careful going down stairs.  I would bump into walls.  My gain widened for balance.  I was vaguely nauseous.  I finally had to tell my doctor I needed to stop taking it when I was coming up concrete porch steps and lost my balance luckily grabbing the railing and not falling backwards.  As for my Blood Pressure it was great! But I wasn't willing to risk a fractured hip or skull.",5
BY USING amlodipine besilate (lodopine 10 mg) swalloing on lower parts legs (pindli) has occured. pl advise. Regards,5
may I use this drug for blood pressure/heart as I am out of Metoprolol ,5
this is poison to you,1
"My systolic was jumping over 200 while on daily doses of Lisinopril HTC 20/25, Linsinopril 20mg and Atenolol 25 mg.  My Dr. added Amlodipine 10 mg.   I hated the way it made me feel from the beginning, but at about the 8-week mark I told my Dr. that it was exacerbating almost every Fibromyalgia symptom I had.  Given it was a time of year when the weather was tough with fibro, we agreed I'd stay on it longer.  Around 4 months I began to notice some edema in my ankle. At 5 months I developed so much pain in my hands that I virtually couldn't use them.  My rheumatologist and family doctor consulted back and forth for a month--meanwhile my BP had still been running high 170's/90's. Finally the Amlodipine was reduced by half. After 1 week on the reduced dose, I was not having any reduction of the pain in my hands, so I called my doctor and told her that I refused to take the Amlodopine any longer.  After another 10 days off it, my hands were still very painful.   At the present time, I am on prednisone, but have not been able to taper that out to the lowest dose before discontinuing it. To be clear: For me, the Amlodipine caused a build-up of fluid in every joint of my hands and wrists; that felt like my hands were going to explode.  The visible edema was not significant, but that wasn't what every joint was telling me. I hope that my experience is very uncommon, and not applicable to you!     ",1
It makes my face turn very red and I do not like that.....is there another drug that does not have these side effects and is both effective?,5
"My doctor switched me from Amlodipine to Amlodipine-Benazepril. Was okay for 2 weeks then since feel tired all the time, dizzy, ear ringing, pressure in my head, feet ankles swelling, constantly urinating all night, neck and back bones sore, went to a chiropractor thinking I threw them both out. Has to be this drug. Going back to just Amlodipine as I was doing okay with it. ",3
"The medication I had been taking was removed from my RX formulary and this was substituted 5mg. After monitoring my BP for two weeks it was marginally better, never below 135/70 and most of the time over 145/80. I am fatigued from the minute I wake up til bed time. I don't know if it'd the amlodipine or not but I would like my blood pressure better controlled.  ",2
"My doctor put me back on this drug after a bout of super high blood pressure. I had taken it in the past, along with carvedilol and pressure closer to normal. However, now I remember why I stopped taking it in the past..Its only been a few days and already I am breathless, dizzy, and can barely get out of my own way, not to mention the return of an erratic heartbeat..Like the way it works, but have to stop taking. Will see dr. next week to get something different.",4
TLL HAVE HIGH BLOD PRESSURE,1
"I was taking this for 4 months and it was horrible, terrible cough which would make me gag and throw up, Dr took me off this and it took about 8 or 9 days before I stopped coughting, I feel sooo much better after I stopped taking  it. If you have these problems please have the Dr change it and you will feel so much better.",3
This did help to lower my B/P but the side effect of coughing and throwing up was not worth it. Went to DR today told me to stop taking he prescribed something else but said it could take up to one month to get it out of my system. It is going to be a long couple of weeks.,4
"Began to bruise easily, and got thin-skin.  Bruising of forearms so significant that blood would leach out of skin.  Stopped taking & problem is almost totally gone.  Other issues like severe leg and hand cramps when working.  Skin tore very easy. ",5
"My blood pressure went down, but I have persistent dry cough.",4
Should I take Amlod/benaz with Lisinopril?,5
side effect exparancing ED ,3
It has worked great for me.,5
what are the side effects if any,3
"Just read the side effects: Insomnia, swelling, tiredness, nausea, cramps, vision issues... That just described the last two years of my life! Never suspected it was this drug. Going to speak with doctor A.S.A.P.",5
"I have been taking this medication for a number of years without problems but in the last 4 months I have been experiencing pretty annoying dizziness; I have been through 3 MRI's and 2 MRA's, all have had normal results. I am now concerned that this medication could be the cause.",4
"This Med was keeping my BP down in normal range. Now that I am losing weight and swimming 5 x a week, I am experiencing low than usual blood pressure numbers, like 109/65 and 107/62 and 106/64 Is this too low? I am seeing my doctor mid-June 2012. Sometimes I feel dizzy and faint when it is low. ",5
Took 5-20 2 x's daily for five years with great results.  Insurance switched me to 10-40 1 x per day and I have a marked increase in BP from 128/70 to 160/82 on average. Now have ringing ears and rapid heart beat. Going to see the Doc for a change. ,4
Effectively lowered my BP but after a month am starting to notice vision changes.  Will be talking to Dr. about this today.   ,5
it's changed my life,5
"Doctor prescribed amlodipine in conjunction w/ lisinopril, since lisinopril by itself wasn't lowering BP .  Both keep my BP down, especially after exercising.  Didn't seem to have any side effects; other than initially getting lite-headed after standing up too fast; libido is normal.  I don't really follow HBP diet guidelines.",4
Pressure still at the high end (179/83). Also using atenolol.,3
I was taking amlodipine besylate for some time when I finally realized that the swelling in my feet and ankles might be due to that.  I had my doctor change to another med and immediately the swelling stopped and I have no longer had that problem.  My husband takes it and it does NOT cause him any swelling.  ,1
I cant find the name for this big pik bd pill! (bipolar mania),1
"bad stomach cramps, indegestion",1
"I am currently taking amLODiPine Besylate along with .81mg aspirin and a  diuretic for swelling of my legs. From the beginning I have suffered from insomnia only getting 4 to 5 hours of sleep at night. The doctor then prescribed .5mg daily of Ambiem. I have been doing this for two years. My symptoms are headaches, nausea, upset stomach, heart pounding during the night and always tired. I either switch doctors or medicine. The doctors offers no solution and when I talk to him I get the impression that its normal.  I get the impression that 'he knows best' attitude. ",4
this medication is not lowering my blood pressure.,1
tried sleepy don't feel like doing anything life is not too good with this drug and I really don't know what else to take my doctor has tried a few other drugs they work for about 6 months and then they quit working or they start causing me problems I go to a family doctorI was wondering should I go to someone the high blood pressure is their specialty and if so what are they called ,2
"Four years of usage. Very good results. No obvious bad reactions. Low libido but I am not sure if the medication is the culprit or just not turned on by spouse after many years of marriage. I know I could go all night with new ""receptor"".",5
not working as well after many years.,4
makes me dizzy when i bend down,2
"Drained all the life out of me!  Gives me headaches, dizziness, gas.  It's an awful drug, getting off out it ASAP.",3

Amlodipine besylate 5mg is soooooo EVIL. IF I had known about this medication before I started taking it. I WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO GET IT. This medicine makes you feel like you're having a heart attack and stroke. Trying to stop taking this medication is like you feel like you have an addiction. It's  like the medication tries to FORCE YOU to take it because of the harsh side effects. I had to basically dumped the medication down my garbage disposal. For 5 days I felt HORRIBLE.

Didn't bring my blood pressure down and I was stuck with all the symptoms. When I went back to see the doctor I told him about it and decided not to take it any more.

"My Doctor switched me from Lisinopril [on this for years!]to Amlodipine because of the 'Dry Cough' that may be a side-effect of the Lisinipril.  BUT, since I started taking the AMLODIPINE, I found I had the same side-effects as the first review I read here at WedMD; stomache problems, weight gain and chest pain! I thought maybe it was all in my head and that I should give it a chance, but I am contacting my Doctor today, and asking to get back on the Lisinopril- I'm not a ""weight-gain"" person either, and I've put on a good 8 to 9 lbs. in the last 2 months!

"I have been taking this drug for close to two years and have had three episodes of stomach pain that landed me in urgent care.  I was given Omeprazole the firs t time and Famotidine the last two times, which are antacids.  I finally got fed up and did my own research online and discovered that one for the side effects of Amlodipine was stomach pain.  I immediately sent a messaged to my doctor and attached the article for his review.  Finally he told me to stop taking the medication.  Today is the first day in almost two years that I do not have stomach pain.  It was so bad that it felt like I was having a heart attack.  I always had this painful full feeling after every meal and I have gained over 20 pounds, another side effect, which is so unusual for me.  There was also the issue of swelling of my feet.  This drug was very harmful and costly to me and I hope this reveiw helps others with their symptoms.",1
My husband has been taking for three weeks for high BP.  Doc said there were no side affects...bull s**t (especially after reading all the other posts).  He has had mild to severe chest pain.  He says it either feels like he's just had a hard workout or got kicked in the ribs by a horse.  He has an extremely high pain tolerance but he was doubled over on the floor this morning in pain.  He's going to doc today.  He didn't notice any weight gain or swelling like others have reported.  Worked great for his BP but not worth his pain.,4
"causes swelling of ankles and lower legs, shortness of breath, dry cough",2
"easy enough to take, but not as effective as claimed.",1
Started to us this drug along with Benicar 5mg at night.  It did help to lower my BP but I started to notice when I was in bed it felt as if my heart was outside of my chest and my face broke out.  Told the doctor about the rash and she said more than likely it was the Benicar and since the Amlodipine was working better she now have me trying it alone twice a day with a water pill Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG once a day.  Have been doing that for approx 3 weeks now and the blood pressure is almost sometimes lower than 120/80 in the AM but approx 130/85 at night.  I have now noticed that a several small bumps on both arms and both thighs and upper chest area and the face is like a road map.  Also have started to experience swelling ankles for the last 5 days. Thought it was due to excessive salt until I started to read the reviews.  Oddly enough I took the Benicar by itself for 3 days and the swelling of the feet went down.  Will now stop taking the Benicar and Amlodipine and go back to Diovan until I see my doctor in early May.,3
"Had major swelling in feet and legs and heat in them too.  Doctor had me tald amlodopine at night and my lisiopril in morning as usual.  TAKING AT NITE MADE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE IN LEG SWELLING.  BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE !!!!!!!",3
I am taking this for High B/P. The first 6 months was ok but then started noticing the weight gain and leg and feet swelling. about 2 months ago the shortness of breath when going up stairs. Has anyone else had bruising type rash on lower legs?,3
Taken to lower blood pressure that went up due to stress. Doc raised dosage four days ago to two pills daily.  I take them at night because label says may cause drowsiness.  Since yesterday I am so lethargic and dizzy I can barely function.  My head feels like I have a tight helmet on.  I had gained 18 pounds in two months.  I think this drug contributed.,1
"I have been taking this medication for a couple of months. It has lowered my blood pressure a little bit but when I checked it today it was too high once again. I noticed that after I started on this medication my weight began to increase, and I have been having trouble breathing, and now I have a horrible rash under my arms from it, but one good thing about this med. it did get rid of my migraines. But I cannot handle gaining alot of weight, I would rather have high blood pressure than gain anymore weight. I have Severe Fibromyalgia and  weight gain makes you hurt more!! Needless to say I will never take this medication or anything in the same family of it ever again. ",4
I've been taking this for over a year and the swolling in my legs has worsen to the point I come home from work and have to elevate my feet. Shortness of breath and weight gain also.

My joints became painful...as soon as I can see my doctor, I am getting off this medication.  I would not recommend it to anyone due to these side effects. Had begun to experience shortness of breath...after I decided to read up on this med, I knew why I had recently developed these symptoms...I have only been on it for about 2 months now...long enough to know I don't want to stay on it.",2

"I was already on Ramipril(10mg)for HBP, but my BP wasn't reducing enough so the Doc advised me to have a combination of Olmesartan medoxomil/Amlodipine & Ramipril. This did reduce my BP at first, and seemed to be working very well for a few months.  However, a range of symptoms began to appearand take root nameley: swelling of ankles and lower legs; extreme depression and mood swings; increasing dizziness; lack of libido; insomnia; upper and lower back pain; body aches;chest pains (including palpitations);and finally, a lowering of my intellectual capacity (ie poor memory, inability to concentrate etc.) Please be warned that this drug CHANGED MY LIFE IN AVERY BAD WAY.  I have now been off this medication for 2 weeks and have no swelling at all in my legs and ankles, and the other 'side effects' are slowly but surely disappearing. My BP is marginally high, under control with other meds.",2
"This med worked very good in lowering my B/P. Having been recently told by my MD that my B/P is of a teenager's, I have endured tremedous suffering and pain. On a daily basis I go through a series of constant fatigue, hives/rashes, dizziness, flushing, INSOMMNIA, sweats and at times leg weakness or leg pains , including swelling from the knees to my ankles. I feel miserable and have no energy for anything. I push myself but it is only getting worse. Here's what I figured out since I have been on this med (approx 6-8 months). In the beginning it works really well with no notable side effects. However,as time goes on, the side effects begin to appear one at a time, becoming unbearable as time goes on. I beleive the manufacturing company purposely designed this med this way in order to get HBP suffers SOLD on its effectiveness and yet hiding the side effects that come on during theraputic use. I am now seeking a new Heart/ HBP Md that truely cares about his patients and not just what free golf outing or vacation he can get from the drug representative who convinces him to push POISON on to us patients. I am now suffering with ITP (lack of platelets) a blood disorder and I believe is as a result of this medication. Please use every precaution before and/or when using this Medication. If you are on it on get off it ASAP. This med can kill you",4
"I have had HPB for over 25 years and used other drugs in the past.  My BP had gotten harder to control and the Dr suggested Azor.  This medication is working very well, even during personally stress filled times in my life.  I have no known side effects and am very happy and would not hesitate to reccommend it to others.  I was hesitant to change, but am so glad the Dr insisted.",5
"The warning that this drug may be harmful to small children and pregnant women should have been a major red flag. I've been on BP meds for years. After retiring and losing 20 lbs Doc switched me to 4 MG (half a 8 MG pill) Atacand looking for a weaker med.  After being on Atacand for a month I ended up in the ER after my BP kept climbing all day (150/110), dizziness and pressure on my chest. I also was experiencing mental confusion. When they asked me in the ER who the president was, it took me a good 30 seconds to come up with his name! Very concerning. After being back on half a dose of my old med for a week, I am back to feeling like myself again. Avoid this drug if at all possible.",1
I have been on Atacand for 3 months. I immediately noticed bags under my eyes and tiredness. i have since noticed my hair thinning. i now have pain in my chest and blocked ear canals. The med has certainly lowered my blood pressure.,5

"Why is my supplier and also many local drug stores unable to get the generic brand of candesartan?  I now have to take the brand name and because we have to purchase through mail order, it is quite expensive!  Is there an ingredient missing?  Anyone know what the problem is?  Thank you!",5
been on it for 3 years along with hct water pill. sometimes it works.  but blood pressure still rises.  not in the normal range.  doctor put me on atenolol.  will see if this helps.,3
have got most side effects even to the point of having endoscopy which was fine so I beleave it was a side effect of the tablets one side effect is food hard to swollow,1
"Taking Atacand 16mg for about 6 months.  Works effectively in keeping BP down, but now have Burning Mouth Syndrome.  Pharmacist says this is due to the build up of chemicals in the drug.  Dr. says ""not to worry.""  Also found hair is thinning.  Well, at least I'm alive.   ",4
"Have had no problems with 8mg. Love it. Recently bp jumped up after 2 surgeries so Dr. added Bystolic, not digging it so far, now I have weird chest pains. Hoping after recovery can go back to just Atacand only.",5

"Only my systolic is ever high.  I take no other meds.  Usually 128/60 Pulse 60. on medication.  Off=150/60 or sometimes systolic is higher.  Tried to get by on 16 but need 32 and take it at night.  Other meds for BP were awful.  Can't take diuretics, K falls too low and get cramps.  Pain seems to make my B.P high.  Have arthritis.",4
"I've been on Atacand plus 16mg for only 3 months and have notice joint pain in my hands, whether this is due to the drug or not can not say for sure. It has been effective in getting my blood pressure back to we're it should been. Must admit a little worried reading other comments that users may have obtained liver & kidney damage due to this medication, will be speaking to my GP about this when I see him next month for a follow up visit.",4
The info given when you buy your drug do'es not list all side effects. Thanks to Atacand I now have cirhosis. I had a C T scan in Jan. 2013 and no sign of it last week it was found on a new scan.I took it over 3 years and am fed up with drug companys! You can only find out the possible side effects if you look up the drugs on Web M D John,1
"this was very dangerous for me, shortness of breath, I am very active had to quit the gym, could not walk more than half a block when I was gasping for breath, pharmacist told me that it effected by lungs; now off of if and on a duretic only; lost 2 kg and my bp dropped 3 points",3
"I take half of a 4 mg Atacand  and all I can say is that after taking it about 1-2 hrs later I am so tired, my stomach is upset all day, and have a cough. My doctor told me to take 4 mg, with these side effects on just 2 mg I have  to be insane to take 4.  People talk to your doctor you are the only ones that really know how your body feels, and make sure they are listening.",2
I have been using this medication for about 10 years and have had no problems with this medication,5
"Since I have been on this med I have sinusitis, wheezing, leg and joint pain, insomnia, and am now noticing more problems with itching and rashes. I have made these complaints to my doctor. I have seen warnings of the drugs in this category and don't understand what it will take other than death for doctors to make connections of the drug and side-effects when presented at office visits. Why does the FDA not step in and stop the pharmaceutical companies from distributing drugs such as these. One has to see the commercials after people have died or suffered. I am going to request to be put on another medication for my treatment. Some doctors have a ""god complex"" and don't listen.",3
weight gain and fatigue,4
"I have been taking Atacand for over 6 mos.  It has helped with my HP but I'm having side effects of joint pain, stomach pain along with shoulder & left arm, & chest pain after I eat. I also get a stuffy nose and whease @ night when I go to sleep.  The joint pain is getting worse and so is the Stomach issues. This is the 5th drug I have tried and they all have terriable side affects for me.  Guess It is time to see the doctor again. age is 62 I'm in good health but over weight. Need to drop about 50 lbs.  hard to do while on drugs.",2
"I have been on Atacand 8mg for about 3 years. The medication has been effective in keeping my blood pressure level, but from the start, I have dizziness, itching and have gained weight. About 4 months ago my Dr increased dose to 16mg.  Since this time I have gained more weight. I am now 25lbs overweight.  I also have been feeling depressed to a point where I don't want to do anything. I am experiencing lower back pain, pain in ankle and now pain in my thigh.  The pain is to a point where I could barely walk without limping, go up or down stairs without assistance or even sit or lay down comfortably. AND OH MY GOODNESS, let me not forget, HAIR LOSS! from the start. I'm not sure if this is being caused by this Med, but would like to know if anyone else is experiencing this. By the way, this is the only medication I'm taking.    ",4
Has kept my BP in 130 over 80 range.,4
it works very well with me no side effects an keeps my blood pressure normal,5
I find it very disturbing that the first reason for not taking Atacand is Renal Artery Stenosis and my nephrologist still prescribed it for me. ?????,5
Seems to kick up my irritable bowel.  Anyone else?,3
"This has been a great medication for me. No side effects!!! My heart function while still less than half of normal is  enough for me to exercise, swim and have a mostly regular life.  However,  since the Feds dropped it from the formulary this year my insurance no longer covers it at any Tier level. So now I have to change to something else. It is really annoying when Politics messes around with your health care.",5
"I have been taking this medication for 7 months now and by the second month I had gained about 5-10 lbs. It seems like no matter how well I eat and exercise, I can't shed the weight. I'm also very very tired. On the plus side, my blood pressure is perfect! I'm going to ask my doctor if it is normal to gain weight and be so tired on this med.",5
Ive been taking Atacand for a few years along with other meds. I would always get a headache whenever I take the medicine but it would keep my blood pressure down. My main concern is the long term effect it is doing to my internal organs. My last doctors visit stated that I have signs of liver damage so I wonder does this medicine contribute to that issue.,3
"Like Alice, I too have had muscle aching in legs and joints. Also my joints (ie knees and ankles mostly) started cracking when I try to stand up from a sitting position! Not sure why, I have been on Diovan and Avapro and had the cracking of same joints, but not the leg muscles aching like I am getting with Atacand. Doctor hasn't suggested using something else yet. Anybody have idea as to where to go with another BP medicine to try? Please email me at [email protected]",2
I have been on Atacand for 6 months and have developed a lot of joint and muscle pain and muscle weakness.  I thought it was Flecainide that I am on also but after reading about this medication I am wondering if it is Atacand that is causing all this pain.  Has anyone else have pain from this?,3
"I have been taking Atacand for at least two years since my insurance took Cozaar off the preferred drug list.  It seemed to do alright but I had to reduce the dosage from 8mg to 4mg last year because of low blood pressure readings.  Recently I have not been feeling just right - light headed, tingly, sluggish with no energy.  Dr. took me off Atacand and I feel much better but after several days my pressure starts rising.  I am starting on Amlodipine 2.5mg maybe tomorrow.  I am a little reluctant to try another drug.  Wish I could control BP without medication.  ",4
"I was diagnosed with hypertension 5years ago and started medication with Micardes 80mg which at the start worked perfectly with truly low side effects but my blood pressure started to move up after 4years of Micardes. My doctor moved me to Micardes Plus which was quite good but for a short period of time. In one of the random checks my reading was 140/105 which triggered my doctor to give another medication in addition to the Micardis Plus but I never used it. I went to another doctor who replaced Micardis with Exforge. Oh God, was fatal on me with lots and lots of side effects. I thought I may die if I continued to use it then I tried the magical Atacand Plus. Frankly, it took sometime to work perfectly but now my readings is around 120/75 during the day and 105/65 at night. Very minimal side effects and feeling myself active and full of energy. I never saw those numbers (120/75) even in childhood. I hope it will continue to work well for me. Tip of advice, learn to calm down as much as possible, meditation and stay active as possible. Cheers",5
"I started taking this med since October 2006, for heart failure it worked for me. I have been doing fine with this  med, my  heart beat is no longer irregular and heart is working much better.",5
I have been taking this drug for about 3 years and have noticed my hair has significantly thinned and I am losing hair everyday on the top of my scalp by forehead,5
"High Blood pressure? Gone. Starting in the past few months, however, I have suffered decreased libido, affecting my life terribly. We have been married 31 years but still enjoy a healthy sexual relationship, until boom! I blame it on Atacand, though I have been taking it for a few years now. So do some side effects life this appear after you have been taking this drug quite a while? I might add there has been no change in my drug regimen. Nothing new has been added, nothing has been d/c'd.",4
I was using lisinopril before this one and starting havinbg a chronic cough from it...Then I was switched to atacand.  Atacand gave me severe headaches for 3 months before I realize it was this med.  So needless to say I am taking toprol XR.  And life has been wonderful.,1
I have been on atacand for 2 yrs now. i develop constant dry coughing lately. no amount of prescription cough med. can take it away. i was on vasetic before still the same coughing side effect.,4
"I had high blood pressure for years, was taking a medication and a diuretic, yet the BP was still too high. My friend encouraged me to see a cardiologist who helped her husband with his BP, and she prescribed Atacand, along with my other meds. For the first time, my BP was just great, and I have felt fine using it for the last few years. Now my health insurance doesn't have it on its ""favored"" list, and I would have to pay $100 for it vs. $10 or $50 for the drugs it has on its list. I talked to my family dr. about it and she switched me to Diovan, which was the closest type of similar medication recommended by the health insurance. This is my first month on Diovan, so I don't yet know how my BP is doing on this med. But I really don't feel quite the same, feel like I am having some palpitations, which I never had. Don't know whether it is just because I am paying more attention to it now, or is really due to the change in meds? Be happy if your insurance covers Atacand. I am thinking of switching back even though it is more expensive.",5
"Been on 16 mg for @ least 5 yrs, has worked well but my insurance is changing and I'm looking for generic substitute.  Have not experienced any of the side effects that are mentioned here.  THANK GOD!",5
does this medication caus erectyl disfuntion,5
"Help, I've been taking Atacand 16mg for several years with good results.  Recently relocated to China where I can't seem to find it - is there anything else similar, or does it go by another name???  I tried the generic on the box but not even under that name.",5

"I am a person who has difficulty with medications.  I have taken this one for only a few days and ended up in excrutiating pain spread intermitently throughout my body starting with my back.  If someone told me this, I would probably not believe them but I have been ill for a couple of days after stopping the drug.  I am still experiencing joint pain and stomach problems.  ",4
pray to God that you will get this drug..... I am on 32 mg for 11 years....NO SIDE EFFECTS,5
"Placed on this medication in 12/09 after nearly a year w/o meds.  Previous inactive medicines caused all kinds of side effects, blurred vision, nightmares, extreme fatigue, dry mouth.  These were lisinopril, metropolol, clonidine:  Atacand has caused no noticeable side effects, bp is lower however is not where it needs to be; am not very active during winter months, but am looking forward to being able to walk to help reduce it further.  I am most at my best in the 112/70 bp range.  Have discontinued eating meats and eat lots of fresh vegetables/fruits, nuts and drink plenty of water.  No smoking or alcohol.  I thank my new doctor for listening to my concerns unlike all the others, even one whom I later found out license had been suspended. As Dr. Oz says take charge of your health!",4
"I'd been taking atacand 32 mg for 11 months now, I developed eye bugs in which I didnt mind at all. The only concern I have is I suffered skin problem after a month of taking this medicine, I have scally redish scalp like dandrupt and now it goes to my face and underneth my ears. I applied scalpicin to relieve itchy and pain, but it just help a bit. Do you think this are a side effects of atacand? Is anyone of you suffered the same thing? ",4
"The drug has lowered by blood pressure, but I now have a numbness or tingling in my hands and feet, which seems to be an ""Other potentially important adverse events that have been reported, whether or not attributed to treatment""  which they refer to as ""Paresthesia: An abnormal sensation of the skin, such as numbness, tingling, pricking, burning, or creeping on the skin that has no objective cause.""

"I am disgusted with this drug because there is no generic equivalent available in the U.S., and the price of this is med exorbitant.  There is a generic equivalent, which I have used, available in Canada from a reputable pharmaceutical company in Japan.",5

Ive noticed severe under eye bags during this time even though Ive no weight on (Hypertension is a family condition unfortunatly). Im reading this and thinking - 'Wow, how come I never associated them to the drug until now. They do upset me constantly. I had always been complimented on my lovely eyes in the past, now they are ugly. Does anyone know if I come off the drug do the bags go too? It works great besides - BP was 220/125 and now 130/80.

"fatigue, constipation",2
It is interesting to see that I have been experiencing all of the side effects.  Could not understand why I have been so very light headed and was becoming very concerned.  I have also started to experience back pains which I had when taking another medication. I have also experienced the same stomach problems I did when taking another medication; bags have also started to develop under my eyes.     ,4

I just read that the water reducing agent in here may raise my tryglcerydes. I will report back after working closely with my doctor.,5
"It works, only it will really lower your blood pressure too low. I think it gives me back pain too.",5
"It has done the job, but I guess there is no generic brand for it.  It is rather pricy and most part D companys do not cover it well.",5
"I have been on other blood pressure meds .and my pressure would always go to low causing me dizziness,lightheadness, since I have been on Atacand for about 2 months now I have been doing very well.",5
"Started 2 1/2 years ago after being over-prescribed other drugs (clonidine, benicar, diltiazem..) & it seems to have the desired result, although one unpleasant side-effect is a loud pulse sound after about 4/5 hours after taking it (8 mg).",4

Need to give a little more time but there is no cough that is associated with the medication At the moment Iam concerned about the intereaction with Pottasium I do not take supplements I have been on the medication for about 2 weeks.,5
I had to stop the drug due to severe dizziness and episodes of anxiety which occurred without warning. It did help the BP somewhat,3
"Swelling, rash,breathing, skin dryness and loss",2
Delightfully side effect free! Too bad it is way expensive - hopefully it will go off patent soon. They say December 2012 - oh I hope so!,5
My doctor switched me to this medication because my insurance did not cover my previous medication. My blood pressure has been up and down.She told me to keep a chart of my blood pressure and bring it along with my blood pressure machine in with me on my next appointment. At this time she will decide what to do. ,3
can this medication make one tired and perspire alot?,3
Only medication that has worked for me.Expensive.Ordering now from canada for  $135.00 for 90 days.,5
"Been on Atacand HCT for over 5 years and has controlled my bp 120/80. Had to switch to Hyzaar due to insurance company switch and it's not on their preferred drug list. Atacand is very pricey but may be worth the high cost. Hyzaar appears to be a problem for me (joint pain)and since i have RA, the joint pain is much more pronounced!Will have to switch back to Atacand.",5
I had tried 5 other high blood pressure medicines and Atacand HCL is the only one that seems to work.,5
"I have been on this medication for several years. It has been so effective that I have not gone to anything generic (Atacand does not have a generic yet), even with no insurance and paying $90.+ for a month supply. No side effects.  It's great.",4
"taking one month, BP staying around 125/75 or lower, get headaches from it occasionally, but relieved with aspirin; no difference in urine output, seems effective for me",5
"This has been a very effective drug for my blood pressure, but the cost is prohibitive on  us being retired, the cost of $270.94 for a 90 day supply is much higher than we can afford.  Is there another medication which will be as effective?",5
"I have had trouble with various BP meds this is the only one that has controlled my BP. I cannot tolerate Calcium Channel blockers, Beta Blockers or Alpha blockers.",5
Keeps blood pressure normal,5
when my doctor first prescribed this medication i was gatting a little dizzy he made a adjustment and my blood pressurs is usually 120over 80.i am a big guy247lbs and 64 years old.a great medicine.,4
Urrinate every 2 hrs. during night.  Do I really need the diuretic?,4
I have had HBP for my entire adult life. This medication is the only one that can control my HBP with no side effects.,5
"This is only the 2nd medication I have taken for high blood pressure. I started on the Atacand only and switched to Atacand/HCT. After one day of slight drowsiness, I have felt NO complication or unusual effects other than a consistent 120/80 BP. This is an amazing drug-no nitceable bad effects and has not impaired sexual performance as other BP meds do. Strongly recommend (I am in my mid 40s).",5
"I was diagnosed with high blod pressure about six months ago. Initially, I had some dizziness but that subsided and it definately affected the sex life initially.  With changes in diet and a little exercise my blood pressure is now in the normal range- 120/80",4
This is a very effective drug but I noticed that Express Scripts has removed it from their preferred formulary and recommend Diovan HCT or Hyzaar.   I do have some light headed feeling but I don't know what it is related to since I also take some other meds.  ,4
"I have been taking Atacand for 5 months now, the early slight dizziness passed quite quickly and now I have no side effects.  I am wondering whether it has a detrimental affect on libido though?",4

"My husband was on amlodipine 5mg table and he gain a lot of fluid retention about 15 lb , and his ankles and feet were really  swollen. Then he switched to losartan and his fluid retention increased and liver enzymes and potassium went up. Is there blood pressure that doesn't make weight gain?  ",1

"This has taken all my energy tired all day and night. I can get 8 up to 10 hours of sleep and wake up feeling totally exhausted wore-down, barely able to get out bed. It has affected my memory, and concentration and I have to research tax cases. I can be watching a program on tv and a commercial will come on and couldnâ??t I tell you what program I watching. I was taking Lipitor it was perfect my nature, personality, attitude, energy was excellent. Would wake able to get out of bed with energy, and not feeling like I havenâ??t slept in week or ran a marathon. This crap SUCKS. Also, this other substitute oval-shaped AVN 80 on one side and APO on the other side. Donâ??t take this it has the same affect. This is not helping when your are totally drained of energy. When something is working they take it away and experiment on us with these faulty drugs. Please report this drug and all the other substitute. ",1
"Fast weight gain which seemed counter productive.  Itching but didn't realize till after I went off that it was probably due to the meds.  Went off as I was loosing my ability to concentrate, think and memory.  When doing research I decided to look up a particular item.  Turned around to type it and had no idea what I was doing.  Not like me so I checked out tthe meds and I fit several of the bad side effects.  Went off and within a week was getting back to normal.   ",1
"I didn't know why they had prescribed this drug for me. I ran across some info about it on the internet that made want to look at the side affects. I had a lot of them. The main ones were achy muscles and joints,Blurry vision, and I just couldn't function. I quit taking it and I feel much more alive after open heart surgery. I asked the doctors why I'm taking it and they said it was to prevent another heart attach. There were several problems in my life which led to my surgery. I know high cholesterol wasn't one of them. This drug is also known as Lipitor.",1
It lowered my cholesterol almost 100 points in 3 months but I started having severe leg aches and back pain plus extreme fatigue. I had no motivation to do anything. I stopped taking the drug and within a couple days my leg pain decreased 90% and I now have a lot more energy.,5
"As far as lowering bad cholesterol levels and triglycerides this worked. The side effects for me included a rise in blood sugar (A1C), itch/rash, and ED. I had tried to stop the medication for a couple of weeks and I was feeling fine but then noticed the heavy breathing coming back with being light headed and dizzy. I have been on Lipitor for over 10 years.",5
I took 40mg for a year and a half.I stopped when I started falling because of week legs.I became so weak that I now can only walk with a walker.I bought an elect. scooter which I use now.I have been to many doctors with no help.I  think I need a good lawyer.,1

I had been taking this medication for at least 2 years.  I have lost 42 pounds and that is when my pain in my knees and thighs became severe.  Dr. took me off this med and has made a large improvement in pain level.  Much better.,2
"It did lower my high bad cholesterol, but also lowered my good cholesterol and that's NOT good, and had a lot of chest pain on 20mg, so went down to 10 mg and it got rid of chest pain, but I know a lot of weight gain since taking it. Does anybody retained a lot of fluid on it? ",2
I have been through a few high cholesterol medications through the years.  I have had high cholesterol since I was 18 yrs old (thanks Dad). I have been on Atorvastatin since 2008 and it was worked wonderfully for me.  No side effects and hoping it will stay that way.     ,5

Also, my heart rate has fallen for the low high 70's - 80's to the low to mid 60's.

My experience with this drug is that it has help my cholesterol and have no side effects.,5
doctor prescribed medication without informing me of reason for medication and  required dietary restrictions (grapefruit). I experienced extreme anxiety and confusion. I stopped the medication and seeking a new primary care doctor. ,3
Name the side effect and I got it. Side effects began on 2nd day. I don't understand with so many drugs for lowering cholesterol why any doctor would prescribe this one. Would never take again.,1
I was hesitant at first but unlike others I started with bad knees and it was like a complete reversal of years of swelling vanished over the first 3 months. My doctor was surprised and thought it might be a combination of nasid I have been taking and this. Stopped taking the 20mg Atorvastatin for a month and the swelling started to return. Went back on and it's gone. I would love to know if others have found similar results or if maybe its just the Tampa humidity.,4
"Started taking this medicine about 10 days ago. At first I had a little muscle pain, but that is now gone. Also had a mild headache for a few days, but that too is gone. I seem to be actually sleeping a little better. I won't know if this stuff is helping for a couple months until my follow up appointment. I'm not sure if I would take this medication after reading some of these reviews. I'll just have to cross my fingers.......",3
"Have been taking this in a low dose for 2 years. Last 2 months I have had brain fog, difficulty concentrating and lots of joint pain in hips, elbows and knees. went to doctor andam being takenoff drug for4 weeks",3

"Took 40mg last night for the first time. Had to come home from work after 4 hours this morning due to severe pain in knees shoulder and back. Feel like I'm in a fog,hurt all over stomach is all upset. I will never take one of these pills again. ",1
"Horrible muscle pain and weakness especially in arms and shoulders. Increased joint pain all over. I cant understand why my Dr gave me this drug since there are many other drugs without the severe side-effects. I went to my Dr and told him about the pain I was having and he said ""your muscles are atrophying"" and that I needed to exercise. I would exercise if I didnt feel like I was dying every time I try to move. THIS STUFF SUCKS!!!",3
"My doctor knew I had muscle pain before but told me to try it and see.  Very effective but upper arm, shoulder pain is worse, now I have hip pain, swollen ankles, itchy all over, etc.  I will make an apt. to see my doctor to get off this drug.",5
"This medication has cause my joints to hurt, especially my arms and elbows. Severe pain",3
"Took 10mg 1 year ago, thought I was going to die.  I stuck in there to see if I could get over the terrible side effects of terrible pain in my right arm to my elbow and terrible pain in all my joints.  My cholesterol went down dramatically.  Tried a different statin with little muscle pain but also no significant lowering of my cholesterol.  Atorvastatin is like poison to my body.  I will try another statin.  Some people can take it with little pain, I thought I was going to die.",5
works great  in reducing bad cholestorol..,5
"I have been taking 40 mg of Atorvastatin for 5 months now and it has reduced my total Cholesterol levels from 340 to 145, and has reduced my Triglycerides to 113.

"I passed on taking statins for years because of leg cramping. New dr. told me that COQ10 helps absorb the statin and also stops the leg cramps. Taking statin now without the horrible cramping. recommend highly this advice, but talk w/ your dr. first.",4
"I am taking it after having a heart attack 5 months ago when plaque broke off and hit my heart.  I only had two spots with plaque built up.  Stents were put in, and I am doing great.  I am having memory problems that I attribute to this drug.  My other concern is that I don't have high cholesterol, yet the cardiologist wants me on this for life.  I don't get a answer that satisfies the ""why for life?""  ""Because"" isn't enough.  I am on blood thinner for a year, and plan to stop the atorvastatin at the same time.  I hope the memory loss isn't permanent.",3
"As with any medication a physical and/or mental reaction is always possible, but this medication has worked very well for me.  It has lowered my cholesterol and now if I can just get my blood pressure under control.  I had no bad reaction with this medication but I do have anxiety issues once in a while.  So I must realize when it is a panic attack, or an anxiety issue and not the medication.  It is way too easy for me to focus on the oh no, issues.  Mostly when it is a new medication, and believe me I have been on a few in my life time.  But this medication seems to be ok, but I would always ask the physician to start me out on the smallest dosage possible, and try to know the difference between the effect of the medication and my anxiety issue.  Shoot it always seems like something, at my age, God Bless and good luck.  ",4

Also, in the past few years, while on this med, I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes even though I am not overweight according to BMI.

I'm having more energy but my back still hurts with a few other side effects.",1
"My doctor wanted me to take 10 mg of atorvastatin in stead of the 10 mg of simvistatin that I've been taking for years to lower my cholesterol.  I've been taking it now for  3 or 4 weeks.  I've been experiencing leg cramps at night, and swollen ankles all day long.  Prior to taken this drug, I had notice some ankle swelling at night only.  Now my ankles are always swollen.  I've also notice feelings of impatience, anxiety and memory impairment.  A few days ago while attending an charity function, thirty mintues into the program I began to perspire profusely, stomach upset and extreme dizzyness.  I thought I was having a heart attach.  The attendants called 911, they took my blood pressure and it was extremely high.  They had me stand up and the BP dropped to 81/40.  Never experience this before.  ER   ran tests:  EKG, blood work, chest Xray, urine...everything came back normal.  What in the heck was that all about?  Dehydration??  Heat stroke, or the new statin meds? ",1
I had a heart attack at age 50 with heart disease in my family. I am on 80mg of this drug and found that my memory and concentration is so bad it is effecting my employment. I am even becoming nervous about going out to do errands as I get forgetful about what to do. I rely on lists and phone alarms but even forget to do those things. The things i am forgetting are common every day activities including picking up kids. I am struggling to even find the right words to type this.  Been on drug for 7 months. Seeing Dr today to drop the drug. Would rather curb dietary habits then to live like this.,2
"I took this med for 7 days. day three neck pain day four and five neck and right shoulder day six pain so bad stop taking med no sleep day seven went to er 4;30am done 2ekg took x rays couldn't find a thing. stop med all together, day nine pain gone took tylenol 3 for pain.   not good med for me.[atorvastatin or pravastatin]",1
"My wife took atorvastatin for two years, and stopped about two months ago due to muscle pain in her knees. Perhaps coincidentally, she had developed an increasing sensitivity to gluten which gave her consistent stomach problems whenever she ate a gluten-containing product. Since she stopped taking the atorvastatin (with no other changes to her medicines or diet), she can now eat gluten. This change was gradual, suggesting a direct relation to the gradual elimination of statin remnants in her system.",2
"I have a little higher than normal cholesterol but have always been told my good cholesterol counter affects the bad.  I have been taking atorvastatin for one month and have started to have pain in my left shoulder and now it is beginning in my left hip.  Also seem to be having a problem remembering things, etc.  I have talked with my doctor and even though he does not think it is the drug I think the side affects are not worth the good affects it has on me.  I'll stop taking it on my own for a month and see if there is a change in the affects that I have been having.",3
"I have been on an Atorvastatin as well as BP lowering meds for apprx 3 1/2 years now. My Cholesterol went from about 212 down to 122! This drug works! I have experienced minor muscle aches and pains in my legs but the benefits far outway the side effects. Besides, I have my GF run an Epson Salt bath and soak my aching muscles once every couple of weeks and I'm a happy guy..",5
"Can't really say if it will work for me or not. The first day I took this med. I had pain in jaw, behind left shoulder blade, left arm. I thought I was having a heart attack, scared the crap out of me.I also had nausea, which I thought was from the pain. After reading some of these reviews I believe it was just side effect from this medication. I have also had cramps along with diarrhea since day one to. My Dr. may not be happy with me but I am through with this. There has got to be some other way to lower cholesterol. A little concerned though my cholesterol is 386. I've never had this problem before, Need to find something else!   ",1
"Have taken for 4 years. 7 months ago, began having severe muscle pain in upper left arm which I attributed to the flu shot. Pain continued & about a month ago, the same pain began in the right arm. Also, lots of pain in both hips for approximately 5 months. I quit taking for the last week and have not had nearly as much pain for the last couple of days. Will be calling my doctor.",3
"WHile this worked to help my husband's cholesterol, he had extreme memory issues.  We thought he had developed dementia!  NOT GOOD! Took him off the meds and saw immediate improvement.  However, he is having problems with memory. I've read that damage can be permanent or take months to reverse. We do not recommend!",3
"I have been taking this drug for 4 weeks now along with BP lowering drugs. Almost since day one I have been suffering stomach and bowel cramps and constipation. Nausea in the morning is common and belching follows every meal.I have also felt tired with muscle aches in the upper arms, back and legs. Now I am no spring chicken and expect some wear and tear to show in my day but the immediate reaction to this drug in my case was quite marked. I will be asking to return to Simvastatin at my next check-up with the Doc.",3
"I have been taking Atorvastatin for over a month. My total cholesterol has gone from 221 to 169 which made me very happy. But I don't like the side effect I have been feeling. Cramps on my legs, Jaw Pain. Muscle Pain and Tiredness. I will be calling the doctor to discuss these feelings.",5

I was taking Simvastatin for several years. I started experiencing some minor side effects about a year ago. Dr switched me to atorvastatin. My bad cholestoral has been lower no side effects so far.,4
"Doctor switched me to atorvastatin two months ago from simvastatin.I have had muscle pain,slight memory problems,tiredness.I am going back on simvastain which i took for 20 years with no problem.",4
Take Statins for 20 years now.  Lipitor is the most effective for my metabolism.  I take it earlier in the day.  Somehow the Statin increases my metabolism and subsequently hinders sleep when I take at bedtime.  No problems when taken earlier in the day.,5
"Wow. I haven't been on this very long, but I feel so sick after taking it. Worse than any illness I've ever had. Extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, difficulty swallowing, and the list goes on. Just too dizzy to try to do anything important. Taking 20mg. I want off this medication. What else is there?",2
"For last 20 years I;m on different Satatins, some are more effective then others. Now after this period I have blood glucose gone up and am a borderline diabetic patient. for which I take medication. I have been told and by physicians and read all Statins increase blood sugar. And many other side affects either ignored or not mentioned by drug companies in detail. Had I was not on this medication I could have a stroke or hear problem, though i never had any heart problem, blood pressure or diabetes when i started this medication  20 years ago only High cholesterol. ",4
I take 40mg atorvastatin. Started with Lipitor in 2008 prescribed by Heart doctor since I have had 3 procedures for stents to unblock arteries. He switched me to atorvastatin a couple of years ago. Leg cramps at night most serious side effects. Total Chol is 169 HDL -51 LDL - 105. Last 9 months PCP put me on 500 mg metformin 2 times a day for type 2 diabetes. End of Sept/14 doubled metformin since AIC was 8.4. Had severe uncontrollable diarrhea and gas. Stopped the extra dose and now he added 5mg glipizide divided am  and pm to the metformin. I read that statins can cause type 2 diabetes and did not have it until 2 years ago. I am going to concentrate on losing weight and adding more exercise to see if I can eventually get off these drugs or at least reduce the dosage. I feel all these meds are working against each other. It is frustrating.,3
" Was on the generic atorvastatin took myself off of it, after having extreme joint pain, chest pain, neck pain for three years. Have been on statins for over 15 years with general pain and joint pain. All my pain issues went away seems I'm not older like my doctors seem to want to defer to or doing work that I'm not used to, like my doctors say. Right now I am pissed off because it seems my complaints over the years have been defaulted to thinking I am wrong about my pain. It was after talking to a neighbor about my knee pain that he told me that statins were shutting down his liver, he went on to tell me about lower chronic back pain and leg pain which I also had.  I had a heart attack three years ago and had a stent put in and my level of statins upped from 20mg to 80mg which is when I really started to have constant chronic pain. You need to be your own watch dog on the medications your doctors give you, because they won't tell you it is the meds doing it to you. The AMA tells them its OK and that ruling is the bible to doctors. Since being off of statins for over a month I feel like I have gone back in time 20 years, I don't have pain I have soreness when I work which is normal. I have more energy, I don't have the stiff neck I have had for over three years, I don't have the tight chest like I've had. I do have less respect for people I thought were working with me only to find out they want me back on the statins. High cholesterol runs in my family my mother died at 86 after falling and going into a coma, not because of her high cholesterol. What I am trying to say is you know your self better then anyone be your own advocate. Trust that most doctors are going to do what the AMA tells them to do, not what is best for you. ",2
"I am so confused. I'm trying to get info on why after several months taking this my ""bad"" Cholesterol has effectively gone higher and my ""good"" cholesterol has consistently gone lower! Two months now on 80mg 1Xdaily. HELP explain this to me!   ",1

I have never been prescribed a drug that made me feel so bad, in so many different ways. Extreme muscle pain, mostly in the legs, malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, mental fuzziness, sleep issues. How can a prescription be effective when it removes all motivation by making you feel bad? Do not understand why Drs are so quick to put patients on drugs when they know how many side effects there are. I was not really warned about all these issues but when I started experiencing them it only took a few seconds to find out how many other people have had major problems with this stuff. I returned them to the Dr and will take my chances...",1
"took for 1 wk. had muscle pain, jaw pain, swollen neck glands, sores in mouth.  stopped for 2 wks and went back on med.  this time, upper back pain, swollen glands, chest tightness and depression symptoms are terrible bordering on full on rage feelings. this stuff is scary.  ",1

I was put on this one after taking Ramapril for a few years and then developing a really bad cough that would not go away,a side effect of Ramapril.

I experienced persistent, intolerable muscle pain & weakness in both upper arms and debilitating hip pain.  7 days after stopping it, my arms are much better, hip pain is gone, and it feels like a cloud of fog has been lifted from me.

Went to my internist the next morning; he prescribed an echo stress test - normal results. On the 5th night - same symptoms only worse; felt like I was CRASHING. Went to internist again; did a 24 hour holter heart test. I noticed that I felt better as the day progressed and looked at the pill I was about to take;then to the internet and decided to discontinue use. The two incidents happened about the same time - 3:30-4:00am. It was an amazing improvement the next morning without the pill, all symptoms were gone except for the numbness in fingers. Again, as the day progressed, I'm feeling like a totally different person. This is just a warning to all, and especially diabetics, that statins can have severe reactions. Trust your gut!

"Diagnosed HBP @23yrs old.Bad genetics. First on diuretics which left me with low potasium. Then betta blockers where my resting heart rate was 37-41. I am in shape but not an olympic athlete! Doctor had me try Azor when it first came out. I have used Azor since 2006. With a brief 2 year stop for pregnancy and breastfeeding where I used amlodipine alone. When Amplodipine stoped working,I weened and went back to Azor. Regular blood tests and no major side effects. As I have gotten older, I do get swelling in feet and ankles if I consume too much sodium. Otherwise I am SO happy this drug has come out. It really has been a life saver! ",5
"I began taking Azor after experiencing severe side effects with Lisinopril. In the beginning, Azor worked wonderfully! Very little side effects. After a year of using this drug it became my worst nightmare. I began experiencing severe side effects. Irregular heart rhythm, itching, tingling, nausea, anxiety, the list goes on! I thought I was going to have a stroke or heart attack everyday for the last two years! Side effects were so severe, I spent the past two years doing very expensive and time-consuming test only to be told the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with my heart, my liver, gallbladder etc! Tons of test to find out the Azor was the cause of all of my medical issues. I had changed insurance companies and they would not pay for the Azor. So I was given a prescription for amlodipine and Benicar. I couldn't afford the Benicar so in the mean time I only had the Amlodopine to take. While I waited for my doctor to get back to me, after going a week without the olmesartan, I realized I hadn't had any heart palpitations and I felt like my old self again. That's when I realized it was the Azor! After two very scary years of E.R. visits, being told I had anxiety, and was paranoid, I find out that the Azor was the problem the whole time! Please do your research. I am sure had I not stopped this medication, it would have resulted in a worse outcome for me! I thank God that I was forced to go without it. Otherwise I may have never discovered what it was doing to me. ",4
I have been taking this medication for 3-4 years with no discernible side effects. My blood pressure has gone from 200/100 down to 118/68 consistently. I am very happy with the results. I had the option of using a Beta Blocker but did not want a med that interferes with my heart rhythm.,5

I have less syncopy than with any other drugs for CHF,5

"This medication has caused me to ""gain"" a lot of weight and I swell everyday.",2
"This is a good drug for controlling your BP, I was on for nearly 6years, didnt know it was doing damage to me. A horrible condition in my gums. (dentist & specialist said it was Azor) And it was effecting my mind. Months would go by and I didnt even realize it. So be careful with this one. I'm now transitioning to a different med. ",5
"This medicine almost killed my friend. Oschner was gonna let him die, but thank goodness he had the money to get a private flight to the mayo clinic. They discovered it was the Azor and took him off of it and now he's healthy as can be. ",1
"I have been taking this for 1 year.  It makes me tired, and I have no energy.  I have also gained weight, and retain water.  Most of the time my blood pressure is O.K. I am going back to the doctor to see if I can take something else instead of this. ",3

Manages to keep my BP in normal range,5
"In Nov 2011, started Azor 10/20 after Lisinopril didn't control spikes during stress. I noticed immediately, lightheadness,dizzy on rising, headaches,etc. Dr reduced Rx to 1/2 pill of 5/20 every other day. Also had severe edema in legs(got another diuretic added for that), tingling, numbness in fingers & pain that wakes a person up in the night, plus weight gain despite exercising & watching diet.Wondering if loose stools are also side effect?  Cardiologist quit before I fired him. Will work to get off AZOR ASAP.",5
"Had blood pressure spiking 180/100 while on three meds - Nifedical, Benicar and atenolol. Doctor took me off Nifedial and Benicar and put me on Azor 10/40. First week on it was fine...blood pressure stablized to 120-130/70-80. Second week starting feeling sick - thought I had a sinus infection, stuffy nose, ear ache. Started with high anxiety, pressure started to drop to 108/56, pulse 50, heart feels like it's pounding, diarrhea. Called doctor, he said I was overmedicated and to stop the Atenolol, if low pressure continues stop current dosage of Azor and call him. I hate drugs, but what do you do when you have high blood pressure????",5
"On Azor for 10 months. BP is controlled. Have not tried anything else. Here today researching possible generic version since my co-pay for brands has tripled. Slight nausea when I started but that cleared up when taken with food. Only major side effect is an unexplained fluttering in my chest. Will discuss with my doctor. No swelling, water retention, pain, diminished libido or other severe symptoms. Would recommend to those who are not helped by other meds.",5
"Good results and minimal side effects with 5/20 taken with diuretics - almost no effect without diuretics.  Dose lasts 24 hours plus.  Does cause some sexual dysfunction, but skipping a dose for 12 to 24 hours and we're fine.  Price is an issue cuz cheap insurance won't pay for proprietary.  Even more dramatic effects when taken with beta blockers prn.",4
"Works great in maintaining BP. Since I started taking this drug, my arms and hands tend to bruise and cut easily.",5
I have been on drug 7 weeks fisrt 5/20 then 10/40 Once a day have stopped taking today...H ave had hair loss bones and body aches....stomach upset I will not take any new drugs anymore...I think people on this drug should be very watchful of side effects.q,3

Use CPAP machine and have horrible headaches at least 5 time a week. Dizzy and sometimes confused! After reading all these reviews I will be speaking to my doctor! Thanks for all the other views on this drug!",5
"Besides the nausea, loss of balance, dry mouth, and trouble catching my breath, this is just wonderful stuff! I would not recommend it to anyone.",5
Rating not accurate.  Only taken one day.,1
my blood pressure is good but my lips are beginning to crack and i wondering if this has any thing to do with this drug,1
Has reduced my blood pressure,5
"Other BP meds seemed to wear off around dinner time where the AZOR lasts much longer, no noted side effects. ",5
"I have been developing real bad side effects.  Severe - water retention, on Face, legs, feet, coughing-sore throat,liver problems, just developed signs of bad liver, Dr. wants to do Biopsy on liver, sugar levels are up.  I'm very concerned with this medication. Blood pressure is excellent though. Don't recommend it.",2
The price on this drug keeps increasing  I can't understand what would make the production more costly.,4
"When first taking this drug, my blood pressure dropped to 120 to 130 over 79 80.  I noticed the more running  I did the faster I dehydrated, also had sinus issues, tingling in legs, and sometimes hands.  Has up and down effects. I'm giving it a little more time to see if the side affects subside.",3
this drug is very effective for for my system,5
"This med quickly lowered my bp significantly. Insurance forced me to Exforge and the numbers were not nearly close to that of Azor and noticeable side effects. I fought to get back on this med because it worked for me. Its more expensive but will rather pay more for clearly what works best for me. Past meds have included Norvasc,Linsinopril,and Verapramil.",5
Helped blood pressure . However side effects caused sinus problems dry nose and throat. Constant sore throat and low grade fever.,3
blood pressure has stayed controled.,5
"I experienced these side effects with Azor...indigestion and chest felt raw.    Terrible headaches, cough, and ringing in my ears.  ",2

"I found the drug to be very effective in controlling my blood pressure. Problem is, I have a tremendous amount of swelling in the feet, ankles and legs. I am unable to get most of my shoes on. The doctor has prescribed a diuretic for me. I waiting to see if this  controls the swelling.",4
THE SIDE EFFECT OF DECREASED SEXUAL PROWESS IS UNBEARABLE.,3
"within days, azor reduced my blood pressure by 30 points",5
"This medicine has controled my high blood pressure, and Iam thankful.",4
VERY EXPENSIVE!! Doesn't control bp as good as other meds I've been on. Loss of libido is the worst side effect!,4
"blood in stool.hearing problems,ringing fullness in ears. ",4
very effective.Insurance forced me to Exforge- ok but not as good as Azor 10 point difference for Azor,5
"When all other blood pressure meds. wasn't working, this worked wonders. Hope insurance will continue to cover.",5
Some side effects including headache and flushing ,3
has lowered blood pressure,5
headache and just dont feel right,5
"headaches, muscle cramps, swelling in feet and hands, horrible way to live.",1
on this med for about 2 months.  started to get swealling in both feet/ankles.  severe cramps and tingling in fingers and seem to get cramps very easy when using hands.  right leg goes dead if I stand on it more than 10 mins.  Just prescibed Lisinopril but reading the reviews now i am not sure.!!!!,4
my blood pressure has been under control,5
no sex life,4
On it for about 6 months now. Does a wonderful job with no side effects.,5
It has kept my BP numbers at normal reading. I've had no side affects at all.  ,5
"Found out that my blood pressure was hereditary. Started at 190/98 in May - given lisinopril - migraine type headaches, tingling in arm and heart papitation. Switched to Losartan - did nothing for me. Switched to Azor 10/40 - too strong, low blood pressure. Asked and was switched to 5/20. Brought down to normal with minor muscle aches (have to fully stretch in the morning especially in the hot shower). Tingling in the arm has been reduced to tingling in the fingers only in the mornings. ",4
I used to be on Benicar 40 didn't work well been on this Azor for the last week haven't had a day without a headache since... BP seems to be stabilizing but these headaches are just... A headache yuck!,4
Pressure still too low but otherwise toohigh,5
"This drug has lowered my blood pressure, but now there is uncomfortable swelling in my legs. Don't know how much longer I can stand the side effects.",4
I have been taking this drug for about 2wks. My pressure has come down from 145/85 to 125/70..5/20mg Azor.  The 1st week was good. I only had swelling in my left ankle and coughing out my head. The 2nd wk I had notice Pvc's (palvations) and tingling in my hands some morning and cold fingertips (flu like systoms) some times.  Sometimes my chest feels like it is about to pop out.  I am to return to the doc in about 2wks unless get to feeling worse. ,3
"I've been on the med. azor for approx. one year and as of 8-16, my bp is still 184/84. I'm on other bp meds too  nothing seems to help.",3
just wanting to learn more about this drug,2
"I started having swelling in my feet, particiularly my left foot.  I stopped this medication and a week later I still have this swelling and it's most uncomfortable.",2
5/20 was not effective.  I had a BP spike of 190 over 96.  (t was increased to 10/40 and there's been only 1 episode of 180 over 83.,1
Azor 5/40 has helped me lower my BP and consistently 100-110/70-80. Downside is the high price but definitely worth every hundred dollar spent.,5
works exceedingly well.  Cialis no longer needed.,5
I have developed headaches since started using.,2
Does not seem to have many side effects like some blood pressure med i have taken before.,5
"I have been on azor for several years.  My blood pressure has been great.  But the side effects are getting worse. Severe joint pain, headaches every day, weight gain, short winded.",5
male 64 w/no blockage but elevated bp-exeercise and azor 5-40 excellent,5
"This drug is a godsend, reducing b/p with minimal side effects.  Adding magnesium tabs 'cured' the constipation that resulted from this drug. I feel great!",4
"BP 130/110 before starting.  At this website because its now, one year later its 90/60 which is too low?",5
"If I take this medication late, I develop a small ache over my heart.",5
it lowers my pressure when other drugs didnot..i still have to use another blood pressure pill with it for it to bring my b/p to 140/80.,3
good,4
I developed numbness in fingers 8 months after starting on Azor.,5
dry cough,3
"At a time when nothing seemed to help my very high blood pressure, this one did the job. Since control, I use 1/2 the doseage previously needed and also take acebutolol once a day.",5
as far as i know the drug is working but i have a question about the odor from the container,1
been taking azor for 2 yrs.+bp stable but urinate every 2 hours at night.,2
It has been the only bp medication that has worked for me in 45 years. I've had hpb since I was 21. I'm now off of it because the VA won't spend the money on it and I lost my health insurance thank you Obama and Democrats,5
Had a two week supply and saw little if any lowering of BP,1
Swollen Feet achy feeling,2
lightheaded with severe headaches,3
"new possible side effect -- anyone developing bittle teeth?  just finished first yr on it, after 12+ lisinopril. fatigue easily but greatly reduced lisinopril roaring tinnitus.  want pep and general robust health back but not the noise -- is there a better HBP med?",4
Helps a little but have to take another pill with it for it to be effective.,2
High Blood Pressure.,4
"My blood pressure is controlled with Azor.  However, I have swollen ankles and have had weight gain.",4
"Azor 1/2 of 5/20 in AM. Was on lisinopril for 12yrs-down to 10 mg last few. Good: no more lump in throat, regained taste. Tinitus no longer roaring- much softer. Azor works most of time. No water retention. Con: vision not as clear. some sore muscles-don't walk as fast or far.  if take in evening will be asleep quickly. some difficulty concentrating, groggy a lot. some sporadic chest squeeze pain -nothing too scarey yet. pulse rate often too high - don't know whether the Azor is keeping it down or pushing it up. Tried Diovan - worse than ACE - deafening tinitus, rapid pulse, etc. Is there a choice without the ACE throat lump and tinitus and the ARB weariness, etc. Want to regain my pep and zip without the noise and loss of sense of taste.  and it has to keep BP down and not mess with pulse.",4
"I have had backaches, frequent urination, and major weight gain.  I need to go back to Doctor.  This is the second BP Med I have been but on.  The first, I had backache, and swollen ankles. ",3
Azor works well at controlling my high blood pressure but I have severe edema(swelling) in my feet and ankles.  I also have back pain when walking.  Frequent urination during the night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep. Tired and miserable-will switch to something else.  ,4
bp was 120 over 160 normally    now 120 over 80 real happy with azor no side effects yet been on it for six weeks,5
it's helped me very much..,5

"I am a healthy 79 year old woman...since taking this drug, wake much of the night having to urinate, and have severe back pain(all since taking this drug).I mentioned to my physician that it was not advised for people over 75...his response...*your are not like othr women your age>""  Not a good answer.  If I take drug during daytime. it makes me sick so I now take it at bedtime .  My dosage is 5/40 mg/  I have t ried numerous bp meds and cannot tolerate the side effects.  I have no other major  health problems.  Because of my youthful appearance and attitude, my doctors ignore my complaints and just keep prescribing meds I can not tolerate.  help??",4

works great to control blood pressure,5
My blood pressure is to sometimes as low as 90/60.  I am on 5/20.,5
It has worked very well for me. No complications at all,5

I wouldn't advise anyone to take it. I'm now going to a specialist for the problem and the first thing he did was to take me off this drug. Hope no one else suffers with this drug as I did.",2
I have only been taking Azor for 2 weeks and my blood pressure has been great 180/82.Also have noticed that iam a lot more calmer at work.,4
My BP was 160\98 I am male 48 years old normal weight and have no side effects from this drug I am takin 5/40 with a dieuretic and my BP is 110/70.  I guess the drug just agrees with me.  ,5
"I am wondering if anyone else has experienced any ""flushing"" of the face since taking Azor?",5
"My BP was 140/96 with previous meds; got switched to Azor & within 6wks pressure began to drop. Currently it stays at or below 125/70; Heart rate at 60 and below. Feel great, 'am thinking of talking to my Doctor for a review & a posible reduction in dosage. Because it is a combo, taking it is relatively easier than multiple drugs.",5
"My BP was 160/100 over 3 months ago. I took Azor 5/40 and it went down to normal  next day. A couple weeks ago my BP went too low I decide to take half pill. For the last few days  I experienced a feeling of not feeling well. this was acconpanied with a headache, tighnes in my chest,tingling hands. BP is 90/60 so DR told me to stop right th way. I do cardio and workout 5x week. Gain some weight.",3
"my blood pressure never goes down. it's always high. i think it might b the wrong kind for me, because it does not help my pressure.",1
Has worked well for me.,5
Joints hurts and back aches when walking,2
"Azor does a great job with my blood pressure, but it seems to cause my mouth to be very dry",5
"I was one of the few patients that had extreme drowsiness and acute short term memory disruption.  I could not really remember reading anything in the newspaper or answer questions from my family.  My daughter was convinced that I have developed Alzheimers, as my father had, and would have to be sent to a facility for patients with severe memory loss.  Worst of all, I simply could not get enough sleep, could not read novels for I would immmediately forget whai zI read, and in general was miserable.  I understand that the memory loss is relatively rare, but my experience was that it was quite severe and extremely frightening, given my family history.",3
"I have headaches, couph, indigestion, tired",5
"i have had high blood pressure for years was taking micardis and it worked great but was too expensive - started azor5/40 and hct 25 it lowered blood pressure side effects is my ankles look like an elephant, coughing and short of breath at night, can't sleep.  calling doctor tomorrow to go back on micardis.",4
"Overall this medication has worked great for my high bp, but recently I have experienced excessive hairloss that I could not attribute to anything else and I saw some other users with the same issue. No other concerning side effects...some easy bruising, hand itching.",4
Great stuff!  Dropped my BP to a avarage of 125/70 sometimes less and from a high of 180/105 almost over night.  Been on it a week no side effects noting.  Great med! I have taken others and stopped because of the side effects. Try it ! ,5

This medicine has lowered my blood pressure to a safe number.  I have had few side effects.  ,5
I maintain a normal B/P range,5
"My mom was just taken off of Azor after several weeks of bad confusion and memory problems, as well as tiredness, insomnia, high anxiety and many other things. I didn't realize that Norvasc was in it when he put her on it and she reacted to it several years ago, so why he put her on it again,I don't know. He has her on Benicar alone now and she is feeling more clear headed now, but it has a side effect of confusion too, so she may not come out of it all the way. She was on a bladder med that had confusion as a side effect too. I'm now taking her to an alternative practioner and he should be able to help her without doing more harm. It has been so hard to see her go through this and she doesn't tolerate any BP meds. She ended up in the hospital 3 times one year, due to side effects. I hope this helps others avoid the same suffering.",3
very good,5
All is great but my blood sugar is high is there a reason this might be affected?,5
HIGH PRICE but keeps my bp in check and sometimes my heart pops around but its just a freaky feeling sometimes...,5

"Hot flashes, made my face and neck turn red/flush. Very uncomfortable.",1
After taking Azor for a few months I noticed a rash between my breast and brought it to the attention of the Dr but he didn't think it was due to the Azor. I didn't have the rash until I started taken the Azor. I'm trying to go back to my old medicine,3
"Was taking 2 pills a day for HBP before beginning azor.  The azor brought my blood pressure down to readings like 107/70.  The first couple of weeks on it were pretty good some dizziness, heart racing, etc. but nothing I couldn't live with to achieve those numbers.  However, beginning between the second and third week of treatment, I began to notice that within an hour or two of taking my azor I would start with nausea and then developed uncontrollable diarrhea in the days to come.  Dr. insisted couldn't be azor and even treated me for something else.  My belief is to look to what's different in your life to discover the cause.  After a couple of weeks on the doctors prescribed treatment, I went back to my old HBP meds for a few days and symptoms started abating.  Kept on them until everything back to normal.  Yesterday for the first time tried azor again since it gave me such perfect numbers, within a few hours the nausea, vomiting and watery diahhrea began again.  Am seeing my doctor today to get refills for my old meds.  Don't get me wrong, for some I'm sure this is a wonderful drug as it does lower bp beautifully.  Unfortunately, there's just something my digestive system can't handle.",5
"my heart is pumping fast,cant sleep,not pleased with the drug",2
this drug causes my temperature to rise.,2
"Azor works well to bring down my BP. Side effects that have bothered me are: back pain, nasal congestion(that has lasted over a year) and increased blood sugar levels. I have never had any of these issues before and think it is the Azor. Dr says these are not side effects. I want to switch meds, she is reluctant to do it.",4
I'm trying to get information about its affect on my bladder.,3
 this medication interferes with sex life,1
"15 years of 150 - 95 trying diff meds, first week on azor and 110 - 70. Been on it for a year now, no side effects, cold hands ?",5
i failed a drug test after taking this medicene,2
I have been taking Azor for about a month because of my high blood pressure. The only side effect is the irregular hearbeat sometimes which I have to tell my doctor about. other than that the medication is really helping.   ,5
my heart has palpatations and gets out of rhythem.Idont like this feeling it has been doing this about five days now it does it worst about an hour after I take the azor.,1
"I've been treated for HTN with several BP meds before finding the ""right"" one. This med hasn't caused any of the SE that I experienced with the other ones.",5
"Washed out, sleepy,dizziness at night when first standing,",4
"bp dropped to 120/80 but wouldn't stay consistant. Side effects were mild but tolerable up until the 3rd week. Side effects included low leg cramps, pain in upper chest area that radiated down my left arm, short sharp jolting pain in my left temple, light headness, dizziness, little nausea, itchy throat, and a head ache that may have been caused by the sinus infection that I had while taking Azor. You may have cold chills that last for about 30-45 minutes also. I would not recommend this medication it has too many side effects that interupt everyday activities.",3
"I have been among those who get dizzy if I get up too quickly. My lower calves are tingly..like just falling asleep. I have noticed a slight discoloration in them as well. My lont distance stamina is shot. I get winded easily. I used to run 2 miles a day, but have settled for working out. I am very satisfied with the way the azor works. I was 150/100 and am now 100/65. I will take the side effects as a trade off.",5
"Bp running 150-160 over 100+ before starting AZOR 5/40. Now BP is 140-150 over 98-106. Pulse 75-85. tiredness has increased, swelling of my right leg has returne. Stopped HCTZ when AZOR started. Rash on my right leg also.",3
"Been on 5/40 for about three weeks. Taking lisinopril also at 40 mg and imdur at 30 mg er. Overall feeling of having flu like symptoms, headache, body aches etc. BP up and down very high pulse rate. Bloating and swelling of hands and feet. Very tired most of the time.",3
This is the only medication that has kept my blood pressure under control for about a year now.  Very Very Satisfied.  Don't feel i've had any adverse reactions to it at all.,5
"My blood pressure went up while on Azor. I had headaches, dizziness and aching neck & shoulders.",1
"I'm only on Azor for 2 weeks, (5/20mg) has lowered my BP and had slight trouble at begining with BM.   Now appears to be fine and have more energy , with less sleep (7 hours solid)and feel much more focused.  I'm not a big fan of drugs,  but pressure started climbing in a 4 month period to 170/115. For years I was on 10 mg of ziac, a 5mg. valium, a 81 mg asprin and a multi vitamin.   I'm 60 and have been told by many medical proffesionals my doctor is right on the money with his diagnoses and prescreptions.  Keep in mind this is new for my system, will keep a close eye on it but has brought my pressure in range 135/88 in a 2 week period.",5
The is the first drug that has brought my blood pressure under complete control.,5
I had been taking cardizem for a few years and it helped to keep my blood pressure at a managable level but I was not feeling well still.  My Dr. started me on Azor 12 days ago and I almost fell off the side of my bed after about 4 days because my blood pressure was down to 99/60.  It now runs 126/75- 88/59.  I have notice  marked difference in the puffiness in my hands and I have more energy.  I started on the 5/20mgs and I am now taking 5/40mgs.  I am also taking Crestor for my cholesterol.  I will stay with this unless it ceases to be effective for me.  I was on Toprol for years and it did nothing for me.,5
"Treatment of life long high blood pressure, typically 150/100 and apparently highly resistant to lowering. Most recently I was on increasing dosages of Hyzaar, ending in maximum one. That was the reason for switch to Azor. Azor 5/40 have not impacted my BP in measurable way. Azor 10/40 with 25mg ""water pill"" (hydrochlorothiazide) have brought it to  ideal levels (120's/80's) within a week. No common side effects (ex. swelling) now but uncommon one: significantly increased fatigue of arms and legs. I am quite active so this was easily spotted within days of starting Azor 10/40 and still remains. Estimated 1/4 to 1/3 more specifically leg and arm muscle fatigue vs. while on Hyzaar. As I haven't had any side effects with Hyzaar I'll attempt switching back to it in the future. Previously to Hyzaar I was taking Atenolol. Compared with Atenolol side effects, I'd rather take Azor. (With Atenolol I experienced much more general and stronger, both physical and mental fatigue).",5
"I have tried several different high blood pressure medicines and everyone gave me severe cramping and pain (legs, thighs, back, sides, everywhere). As soon as I went on Azor, my blood dropped to a normal level and I rarely have any cramps at all.  This tiny pill has worked wonders for me",5
5/20..I do have some swelling in the legs and some face flushing.  Now I do have hot flashes but I can tell this is different and more intense.  No cough.  Would like to change to something cheaper but it works pretty well so I may have to just make it work.,4
"I have HBP and small artery atherioscloros which causes alot of chest pain and burning.  Was switched to Azor from Hyzaar.  Azor gave me terrible chest pains and heart beat so hard I didn't sleep for 4 days and nights.  Stopped taking and went back on Hyzaar but after 2 weeks, still have some bad heart palpitations.",1
"bad headaches,no energy,no appetite",1
"shortness of breathe, and some swelling of legs",3
"The HBP is secondary to a condition I have call PCOS(PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome).  The azor lowers the HBP to a great range, but the swelling of tissue is a horrible side effect for me.  It actually agrevates the PCOS and causes me to have month long(or longer) menstral cycles.  My Dr. tried telling this wasn't the case, but When I stopped taking it The PCOS got back under controll.  I started taking it ona daily basis again, and the bleeding started again.  Absolutely horrible",4
"hyperactive, swelling of feet sleepiness",1
It has lower my blood pressure. It doesn't make me feel lightheaded and my legs no longer itch. I do feel bloated and am constipated. I also still feel short of breath occasionally. Overall it's working.,5
"Azor in the 5/40 dose worked well for me and brought me from stage 2 hypertension to normal in under a month. also, notice that i feel calmer and more energetic.",5
"My doctor changed my blood pressure meds about two weeks ago and wanted me to try azor, since changing i have headaches everyday, my heart races like i have run a marathon just walking across the room and i feel like can't get a deep breath sometimes. I am going to the doctor tomorrow and get a different prescription.",1
"it has brought my blood pressure down.I take it at night and its not making me feel bad or nothing ,like sleepy ect.",5
"reduced mybloodpressurebetterthananythingelse,but extreme swelling of legsandankles, possible fluid retention",4
I really like Azor. I used to have to take 3 pills and now only take 1 in the morning.,5
"When I started this I had bee on several others for a month at a time with limited results. My Dr. started me on this and the first 2 weeks I almost gave up but I stayed with it. I am taking 5-20. BP when starting was 140-160-/95-105. I check it daily in the morning and after 6 weeks I am 115-125/70-80, which is remarkable. Only side affects I have noticed are some face flushing which has subsided to once in a awhile and feet swelling. The swelling seems to still be with me but they do not bother me at all. I would have to say at this point the benefits outweight any minor side affects.",4
"does not bring blood pressure down to normal, still runs high.",3
"I just started on pill. was taking another pill that made legs swell.. this doesn't. BUT ! since I'm on it,had cough,sneezing... will go Dr. on !7th.. to see if it's the pill.  ",4
I was taking the 10/40 strength early in the morning and began to have intense dizzy spells thru mid mornings and noon.  The Doctor split the dossage to 5/20 twice a day and still have occasional spell but not as many or intense.,5
"I'm 39, male. I've had hpb since I was late teen. I've tried all sorts of meds and combos. I've been on Azor for about 5-6weeks now. I've also never really suffered some of the awful symptoms I'm seeing on here on any med outside of having ED, maybe a little weight gain (which I cannot say was from previous BP meds or diet). Most meds have not worked well keeping me around 130-140/85-100. So far on Azor, I've noticed a big difference. My BP is about 125-132/75-85. So, that's good. I can feel it. I'll have my wife watch for hair loss/weight gain which would suck. However, the ONE effect I'm having (not sure if it's the med) is loose stool, in fact (sorry to be gross) when I workout or even sitting at work, can feel it just ""leak"". I know that's gross, but it's something I've just noticed occuring daily lately and am not sure if it's connected to Azor. Nobody else has mentioned it on here. I'd like to know if someone can relate.",4
No side effects so far I feel better after taking this medication,3
"just curious, I really do not know about it. I have renal insufficiency, and congestive heart disease.",2
"10/40...Really bad headaches,frequent urination at night,swelling of ankles and heart palpitations. Feels like i'm running a marathon. Dr. put me on this after my insistance to be taken off Tekturna/ Coreg. The coreg was like toxic waste in my body, and gained 40# in 15 months. Now seems as though Azor is NO better. Don't know what to tell doc, pretty sure all this stuff is the same. Like a previous poster, I'd rather suffer the heart attack and get it over with.",4
I have terrible coughing attacks along with severe acid issues.,1
My Dr. put me on Azor 5/20 for bp that was running 199/110.  It has helped to lower some but still running between 160/100 and 158/96. Haven't had any real side effects with this dosage but when I go back for next visit I am going to ask if we need to up dosage or try something else to get my bp down to a more acceptable range.,3
i get light=headed and very sleepy,3
"Azor seems to work very well altho it took about two weeks to get to 120/70 from 165/95. I take 5/20mg. Effects I don't like are swelling of my hands, I can no longer wear most of my rings, and itching, burning and numbness of my right upper thigh. If I stop the Azor for a couple of days the symptoms go away. When I restart it comes back. If I take it every other day the burning and numbness stays mimimal,but if I take it every day the burning becomes very intense especially at night. I am convinced that the meralgia paresthetica is caused by the Azor because of the swelling of tissue that it causes. I also noticed urinary urgency when taking everyday that goes away with reduced dosage. I think the tissue swelling that Azor causes is at the root of all my symptoms. I see the doctor next week, will probably have to switch again. ",5
"I have been taking Azor for 5 days, BP up and down but pulse rate very rapid, over 110. I have been on beta blockers, ace inhibators (about coughed myself to death) now this. How long should it take to see result? BP goes from 125/70 to 145/92",3
"you request that i click the stars, where are they???????????????",2
"Well I have been on Azor 10/20 since December. So far my blood pressure has come down and is rather consistent now.  However, living in the Southwest, the sensitivity to the sun is high.  I highly recommend sunblock, hats, and staying out of direct sunlight.  In the past, I have only lightly tanned.  The senstivity has gotten so bad that I really burned at a weekend event (and it's only March - not even close to summer highs and heat!).  I have also noticed slight weight gain.  I have also noticed that I seem to have less energy than before.",4
Great Med ,5
"I tried Exforge in two different doses and it didn't work well and I started losing my hair.  As a female, this was pretty scary.  My Doctor put me on 5-20 of Azor and it has worked extremely well for my blood pressure and the hair loss has definitely slowed down.  I would like to try something else to prevent the hair thing, but maybe all the blood pressure drugs may have the same effect.  I'm going to discuss this with my Doctor.",5
Was able to lower blood pressure fast. Does cause ED problems. Will stick with it for now.,4
I had been on Diovan for approx. 2 years and couldn't get my blood pressure below the 145-175 range. The Azor has kept my blood pressure at about 135/73 consistenly. I do experience dizziness when rising from a seated position. I usually stand still for a moment to balance myself.,4
i'm having tingling and burning feet and want to know if its drug related,4
BP was running really high over past 2 mo and doctor tried several different meds. AZOR 10/40 dropped BP but now it sometimes gets way too low 80/40.  Went to new doctor today after loosing confidence in my previous doctor and they changed med to 5/40.  Sure hope it helps.  Been having lots of chest pains and numbenss/burning sensations in left leg and arm along with heart rate racing 130-150 range at rest only to have it drop to normal a short time later.,3
"Was on HCTZ for several years but pressure began to creep upward. New doc put me on Azor 5/20 which lowered it some but not enough. Upped dosage to 5/40 and pressure came down into the desired range. Experienced swelling of ankles and feet, so doc rx'd HCTZ 25mg which I take in the a.m. while taking the Azor in the p.m. Other side effects: some dizziness (went away when switched to p.m. dosage, swelling of ankles and feet, tingling/numbness in upper right leg, undesired weight gain (was not warned about this), bothersome dry cough, propensity toward upper respiratory infections, decreased libido and increase in E.D. symptoms. The overall rating is positive for the desired results: lower BP.",5
"worked great but after about 3 weeks, my blood prssure went way down, to the point I almost passed out.  I stopped taking it and my blood pressure as been fine for about 3 weeks, but now my blood pressure is creeping up again. ",5
"Azor is a good medicine to help lower blood pressure.  I liked it because it was 2 meds in one.  It kept my bp low.  The only problems I had with it was swelling of feet and ankles.  I have stopped it because of cost, but I think I might have to go back on it, because I don't like the side effects of the other drugs the dr is trying on me.  It did make me feel tired though, but I can handle that.",5
"It took two weeks for a noticeable drop from 160/95 to 130/80. I take 5/20 once a day. I recently developed a itchy, burning and tingling feeling in my right upper thigh area and some lower back (kidney area) pain. I have been on it for two months and will continue one more. Hopefully the symptoms will go away because I otherwise feel fine.",4

extreme itching; hair loss; edginess,1
"Although my blood pressure came down, the second day i felt a burning sensation in upper right chest. It's been 6 days into taking azor and the chest pain is still there. I'm also getting headaches. Will probrably go back to Lisiopril, i'd rather deal with a little cough than the chest pains.",4

"I was really surprised at how immediately I felt, I only take azor 1 time a day. In the morning and before I took medicine2 times a day and had a cough. Im glad my new primary suggested azor for me.",5
"Prescribed 5/20 for HBP. Took for 2 weeks and no change to BP. Als0 experienced some side efffects. (sick to stomach, headaches). Called oncall Doc over the holidays and he increased dosage to 10/20 to help w/BP. Side efffects really kicked in!! Couldn't get out of bed over the weekend. Felt like I'd been hit by a truck. Sick to stomach, general overall yucky feeling. I was taken off this drug immediately when I called the Dr office on Monday AM. ",1
"Extreme swelling of my feet, ankles and hands.  Hungry all the time - even right after eating. Stopped Azor for one day and the hunger stopped but it might take longer for the swelling to go down.",3

As far as the side effects, from time to time I will have light headiness,mild chest pains, dizziness, numbness in my arm and tingling. I have had EKG'S done, stress test...etc...The side effects don't happen everyday but they have happened enough. On my next Dr's visit I will discuss this with him and maybe he will lower my dosage from 10/20 to the next lowest dosage.          ",5

Headaches,3
"My blood pressure was in the range of 140 to 150 over 85 to 90 using my old medication. Since taking Azor my blood pressure has come down to 120 to 130 over 70 to 80, however if I continue taking my pill every day, my pressure drops drastically, as low as 80 over 60. This drop has me really concerned and if I don't take a pill for three or four days, my pressure will remain around 125 over 75. I don't understand why my pressure fluctuates so much using Azor 50.",2
Have been taking for 3 months and found blood pressure is lower overall. No side effects have been noted.,4

"This medication did lower my blood pressure, however it gave me flu like symptoms and made me very sick.  The same as with Amlopodine,  I developed a deep wet cough.  I became so sick, I was bedridden, before I could get it out of my system and be done with it. Thankfully, I have a doctor that listened to me and didn't jerk me around when I identified the cause of my flu-like symptoms.  In fact, he said he has seen this before and stopped the Azor that day. It takes up to 2 weeks for it leave the bloodstream and the flu like symptoms to go away.  Doctor had to give me a steroid shot and a B-12 shot to help me get up out of bed, I have felt so poorly from Azor! Symptoms are not worth it!  I'd rather kill over with a heart attack than have the flu the rest of my life!  Just being dramatic here, in case any  passion of my fury was missed!  :) My doctor has asked me to try Divoan HCT. Will start that tomorrow.  ",3

Decided on my own to stop using Azor and within 6 days everything disappeared.  Have been given Tekturna (300mg/25mg) to take.

Do not take this drug.  It can kill you.  Why it has not been taken off the market is inexcusable.  About 1200 pending lawsuits.  Why our system allows pharmas to kill people is horrrendous.,1

It got worse and worse rapidly to the point that I couldn't remember how to do routine tasks at work and home. I honestly thought I was rapidly developing early Alzheimers. They insisted I schedule a dr. appointment and discuss the situation. He said it wasn't a reported side effect, but I discontinued using the drug and within three days I was back to my old self with no more memory problems. Clearly it was caused by the Benicar because it was the only change I made.",1
"I'm a 52 year old male who has been taking this drug for 10+ years.  Side effects will sneak up on you with this medication.  Yes, it did control my BP.  I have a long list of side effects that are to may to list here.  Extreme fatigue and breathing issues are my latest problem.  My joints ache and I feel like I'm falling apart.  Before I started this medication, I was a healthy active man, now I am a depressed, sad and unhealthy person.  It has to be the Benicar!  I'm to young to feel this way.  Beginning today no more of this poison is going into my body!  ",3
I have tried all my life to avoid doctors and medication but at the age of 43 had to begin treating high BP. Tried two other meds. little or no positive results. Benicar has maintained BP at very good levels at low dosage with zero side effects. I don't recommend taking drugs but if it's absolutely necessary I would recommend this one.,5
"Switched from lisinopril to Benicar because of the chronic cough and continual sinus infections I was getting from taking the ACE inhibitor. My cough cleared up in two days after the switch, and as long as I take the medication at night, I'm not bothered by dizziness. ",5
" Benicar was the 3rd ARB my doctor prescribed when I developed a cough from lisinopril. With each successive script, my blood pressure increased until it reached 179/106. I felt horrible, my heart pounded and urination decreased. I had only been on benicar one week. I saw the PA and said I would go back to lisinopril despite the cough. After 3 days my BP was back to 131/80. Apparently, ARBs are contraindicated for me, but I don't know what actually happened. No more ARBs for me.",1
Found this online about lawsuits on this drug Dr threw at me samples to take  BP is around 150/84 age 67  What do you think?  Iam not going to start this...I have already IBS  http://www.drugwatch.com/benicar/lawsuits/,1
Had reoccurrence of unexpected sleepy spells. Taking for high blood pressure. Every BP medication seems to have it's side effects.,4
"After 3 months on 40 mg dose I saw no improvement in BP (146/78) vs other drugs evaluated.  Further, I have developed Lichen Planus!  Coincidence?  Has anyone else developed this condition while on Benicar?",1
"Works perfectly without any noticeable side/adverse effects.  I buy olmesartan medoxomil (generic, exactly the same as Benicar) made by Macleods a reputable world class manufacturer in India where most of the world's drugs (generic or branded) are made for about $15 per month which is one half of what my insurance co-pay would be.  This is another example of America's broken, plunder for profit medical/pharma system.  Note: The last time I bought Benicar it came as loose pills in a non-airtight bottle.  The generic from India comes in identified high-quality blister packs.  Just another example of how broken or pharms system is.   I am both a caretaker and a patient, I take BP's dozens and sometimes a hundred times a week--when I switched from Benicar to generic------no change.  It's the real thing.  ",5
"I have been on it for at least 5 or more years.  Problems with urination. Burning, inflammation. Pins and needles in my feet. Felt like a uti. Stop taking and starting to feel better.",3
I was on same drug years ago stopped due to side effects of making me tired. I tried some others with mixed results. I am now back on 20 MG 1x daily I weight 265 lbs and I am 52 years old. almost 4 hours later I am out like someone turned off a switch. I it scary if their was a house fire I would not know or could not get out.  I also now have noticed GI problems and cant help to wonder if Benicar is the cause of my GI issues. ,3
I have been taking Benicar for 5+ years now. I am very happy with how well the drug is doing. I was taking 20 mg for the first few years but I have been able to cut back to 10 mg with the same results. I haven't had any noticeable side effects like I did with some of the drugs I tried before this one. I'm am happy consumer!,5
Alleviated the chronic cough from previous Blood Pressure medication.,5
Have been taking Benicar for several years. Have had no side effects. It has controlled my blood pressure along with a diuretic and potassium.Very pleased with this medication. It is a little expensive and my insurance doesn't like it but will not change.,5
Only problem I have taking Benicar is making me sleepy most of the time and some lethargic. Blood pressure is good when I visit my doctor. First time in long long time trying other b/p meds.,4
I recently switched from Lisinipril to Benicar. This has helped me with less phlem and cough. I am very satisfied with the results.,4
Been on this med for the past 8 years. In the beginning I felt light headed when rising from a sitting position. That side effect has long past. My blood pressure is normal every time it is checked at the Dr office or when I check it at home.,5
"I tried several BP meds, all of them made me light headed. SO light headed that it scared me. I had to choose between dizziness or high blood pressure. THEN, I tried Benicar. I've been taking 20mg twice per day for a few years and not only has it controlled my blood pressure very well, I've had ZERO side effects. For me personally, It's been great. Other drugs I've tried were intolerable.",5
"side effects horrible, thought I was having a heart attack",3
Severe hives,5
I have been on Benicar for 10 years now and my blood pressure is normal now.  No side effects. ,5
I have had no side effects.,4
Have been taking it for 8 years with no problems.  Blood pressure is always controlled.  Have been on blood pressure meds for 30 years; None have worked as well as this one.  Now my insurance is not going to pay for this med anymore. Am scared to death to try something else. Have had atrial fib; Am worried that the other meds side effects of rapid heart beat and pounding heart rate will make me go back into A Fib.  I feel this insurance change is a result of Obamacare.  Not happy with this change. ,5
"I began (last night) to take 40 mg Benicar, after d/c Toprol due to the cardio problems, and Lisinopril, though I have had no side effects from it at all.  I have SLEPT THE DAY AWAY TODAY.  I AM EXHAUSTED.  HOWEVER, I do understand that I need to give my body a chance to adjust, but still, I can barely stay awake!  I wanted to stop beta blockers because I like to exercise (I go to a gym, lift weights, and have tried to do some cardio but that is the main reason why I wanted to stop beta blockers.) Anyway, I also noticed that my sinuses are very unhappy, like they used to be when I used Fentanyl patches for chronic pain.  interesting how fast a drug can cause side effects.  If this fatigue continues for more than three more days, I will stop this drug.  I also had to point out to my doc the fact that i have high potassium blood levels.  Otherwise, he would have blindly gone on without doing labs.  One must take control of one's health!  Do NOT leave it to doctors, no matter how much you like them.",3
After trying over 15+ blood pressure medications this is the only one the controls my blood pressure effectively AND I have no side effects.,5
I think it is causing a cough,3
"Had been on this for 10 years. Then Insurance took it off their ""Formuulary"" Drugs that are covered! Changed to medication after medication. None did the trick & resulted in side effects. This year insurance has on ""Formulary"" & my co-pay is managable. My readings are back to 120/80. I have taken BP Meds since I was 32 & I am 71 now. None worked as good as Benecar HCT (Hydachlorathiazide) A diuretic that I took 30 years ago by itself is now combined with Benicar. I am very happy!",5
"4 years on this med and within the last year began experiencing celiac symptoms (including blisters), and eye irritation.  Checked for celiac disease and found negative.  ",5
"Second year taking it, now having sinus problems, muscle tightness with weakness in wrist elbows, knees and ankles, pain in joints, tinging, burning and numbness in my hands and feet.I am type 2 diabetic.BP is not controlled.Not sleeping well at night two hours or less.",3
Seems like i have sinus problems and my legs hurt,2
"the Olmesartan worked well at 40mg, and then the Dr. added amlodipine which damaged my gums, and had to be stoppped ---- The agents say not to take more that 40mg, but after extensive reseach on google he found there was no evidence or trials of any maximum dose at all, but he did find it had a fairly short half-life ---- so he gave me 40mg Olmesartan with the diuretec in the morning and 20mg Olmesartan to take in the evening = [60mg total] and now it works very well --- in truth there is no eveidence of any maximum dose of and ARB is all supposition, 60mg works very well",4
I can't sleep well if @ all  @ nite after taking Benicar (last three month.)in a.m. (with other meds)very tired & many naps during day wondering if Benicar has anything to do w/this problem?,1
"Controlled BP very well. However, side effects includes muscle & joint pain, swollen feet, cough and hair loss. Otherwise, very good in lowering/stabilizing BP?",4
Have been taking BP meds since 2003 and this is my fourth one and the only one to really drop my blood pressure to where it should be. 110/70 is amazing and no side effects. Thank you Benicar!,5
"I do not know why, but Benicar keeps my BP more level and controlled.  I have tried six other brands and none worked as well.  I am concerned about aging and taking it late in life.  But, as of right now, my blood tests come out very good.  Hope this keeps up.",4
"i HAVE BEEN ON BENICAR FOR OVER A YEAR. i T REALLY DOESN'T HELP BP ANY MORE. i ALSO HAVE BAD HEADACHES ALL THE TIME. jOINT PAIN,LEG CRAMPS REALLY BAD AND HIP PAIN. iS IT THIS MEDICINE???

"I have taken Benicar for about 20 years, and it has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure. However, I started having severe diarrhea, and my physician has now taken me off it, because he believes I have developed an intolerance for it. I had no idea this was a possible side effect! I also have had constant aching in my bones. I think Benicar is the cause. I am glad to be off this medication. My advice is to be constantly aware of how your body is reacting, and do your own research!",5
"It has caused chronic sinus problems that will not go away, until I stop taking the drug.",4
"Very effective at low doses, with no adverse effect.",5

"This drug Benecar, not Benecar HCT, but Benecar is questionable. I was prescribed 20 mg, with BP 170/65 slight reduction, then added to it Norvasc, and the combination gave me flashing lights in my eye which made my macular degeneration go from mild to blind in one eye. Stay away from Norvasc, & tho' am still taking 40 mg of Benecar, and considering discontinuing. Anyone else have vision problems with these drugs?",1
"My husband age 50 in great health has been taking 40 mg a day for 2 years, 2 weeks he stated feeling dizzy, lightheaded, lathargic,blurred vision, leg cramps , dehydrated, soreness in the kidney region, frequent urination and coughing.  He went to his primary dr. ran a bunch of blood and xrays, blood preasure dropped to 81/62 got a call his blood sugar was up to 462 and climbing by the time we made the er his blood sugar was at 618, he has no history of diabetes and either does his family. spent 7 hrs on an iv drip with insulin to bring it back down. he is now being told he is pre diabetic, dr's absolutley refuse to hear that it is the benicar they are convinced he is diabetic. this medication is effective for short term use but after prolonged use it has some major side affects, if you look at the symptoms of diabetes and the side affects of this drug they almost mirror one another, if his dr refuses to listen to us we will be making not only a perscription change but a change in dr's as well ",2
"I know this sounds weird, but my brain has a buzz when I look quickly at something. I thought it was me so I stopped taking it and it went away. Second, my BP , went down from 160 to about 140 so it was just ok for me. I went back on it because my bp went back up to 180 when I stopped taking it. anyone else have this problem?",3
I have been taking Benicar 20 mg as a supplement to Toprol XL. It has been very effective and I have had no problems whatsoever.,5
no side effects that I noticed,3
I've had high blood pressure for decades  I finall got it down to 125/80 or so consistently after using bennicar and carvedilol and the ADDING spironolact   I've had to REDUCE the doseages now to keep from having too low of  BP,5
Changed from Lisinophril 6 months ago.  I'm having no side effects with Benicar.  My BP runs consistently around 125/67.  Continues to work well for me. ,5
"BP had been running 145/95.  First day on Benicar it jumped to 165/105.  Second day it was 178/100.  Had chest fluttering, shaking and a very bad anxious feeling.  Called Dr. who said, "" You haven't been on it long enough.  Keep taking it and if you have chest pain, go to the hospital.  NOT.  I stopped the pill immediately and returned to my original meds which took the BP back down.  Can't say I happy with a recommendation of waiting until chest pain occurs before doing anything.  ",1
"I was getting worse each week.  I would have high spikes of BP twice a week. I lost strength. Instead of walking 2 miles a day, I could only go a few houses down the street. I had severe cramping in my legs, arms, and hands.  After getting off the Benicar for 24-48 hours, I felt like a new person.  Now I am walking 2-3 miles a day and the cramps are gone.   ",1
"Worst experience of my life. First, like 5 mg will work anything more and your bp will be too low. Second.  The pain.  First the hip pain, then I think I had an allergic reaction and the muscle pain in my left arm was so severe and painful...it wore me down.  I couldn't move my arm and this is 4 days after last dose, even further, my thumb is numb today (4 days later). Went to physical therapist today and going back tomorrow.  I will never touch this class of meds again.  Ever.  They told me two weeks to get out of my system. Seriously one of the worst experiences of my life. Chronic pain wears you down down down. This was severe.",3
it raise my blood presser from 125/74 to 150/90 also cause pain near my liver so I no longer use it,1
"Before Benicar, my Blood Pressure wasn't controlled by hardly any type of BP meds. When I got on this med, my blood pressure has been very manageable and controlled. Very happy.",4
"Benicar 20mg made my hair come out...in clunks.  I was on for 6 mos. and lost about 50% of my hair. Cardiologist (who put me on the medicine) and dematologist said that this wasn't a side effect, but after my primary doctor change it to Bystolic, my hair stopped coming out the next day and has not come out since then which is now about 1 yr. ago.",1
"I was using lisenopril and was not doing well.  A continual cough and sinus infection as well as difficulty breathing.  My chest was very heavy and walking across the room was taxing.  I went for a pre-surgery check-up and physician changed my prescription to Benicar.  The cough and heaviness went away and I feel really good, right now!  I am thanking God for my blessings! ",5
My blood pressure is very hard to control. My doctor put me on this medication and it has worked.,4
"I had numerous major side effects with name brand.Benicar   effects: choking, cough, thick throat, back ache (area of kidneys), decreased urine despite fluid intake, swollen ankles, aching bones,. Benicar contains sulphonamide, (I'm allergic to sulfa drugs). Recent lab results showed major increased triglycerides, cholesterol(s), etc. as in DANGEROUS.   Until it became unavailable I took 10 mg Lotensin (name brand) because I had horrible side effects with the generic Benzapril when it came on the market. After a couple of months I reported the adverse side effects and my doctor began writing ""Do Not Substitute"".  I NEVER had a single side effect or adverse incident with the Brand name Lotensin.    My humble opinion is that Some Generic medications are DANGEROUS and should never be prescribed.  Many pharmacies default to generics automatically substituting until you call their attention to the ""Do Not Substitute"" and after commenting on the notation on the prescription have been told we do not sell name brand.  ""If you want to purchase the bottle of 100 tablets we'll get it for you"".",1
"Have taken this medication since 2008 with no apparent side effects.  Recently however I was hospitalized for severe dehydration, acute kidney failure, low potassium, diarrhea, and low blood pressure.  Two attempts to take the Benicar HCT 20 after I was discharged from the hospital resulted in violent vomiting and an increase in diarrhea for 6 hours.  Totally shocked that the side effects showed up years after I began taking this drug, so be alert to any changes in your health.",5

"I have been on BP meds for 30 years. Even on a combination of BETA blocker, ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blockers my BP never got below 150/100, and spiked higher.  I've been on Benicar for two years, my BP is great. I have had no side-effects.  Please don't be fightened away by all of the things you are reading here. Hypertension IS a killer.  Every day it is slowly doing damage.  Anyone who thinks a ""herbal remedy"" is the answer is just fooling themselves.",5
I had this prescribed by my cardiologist along with toprol the combination of the two caused my B/P to drop to 70 over 70 being a Paramedic at the time it caused narrowing blood pressure. There should be cautions given to cardiac patients with this combination of prescription drugs.,3
very satisfied with BENICAR CAN I TAKE AT NIGHT,5
"My doctor was unable to get my blood pressure under control until he had me try Benicar. I do take 2 other blood pressure controlling medications but, until Benicar they just were not doing the trick. My BP has been as good as when I was a teenager. Most of my daily head aches have stopped also. I will never change my medication.",5

I'm not entirely sure other problems I have are side effects, but I can say my latest problems coincide with my latest refill.  I have been experiencing moderate to severe knee pain.  My entire left knee aches, the right knee less, but they ache the same way.  After reading some of these comments, I will back off the 40mg dose and report back.",5
"Have taken Benicar 20 mg for <6 mos, and it has lowered my bp immediately. After 4+ wks, had start of cataracts and start of vitreous detachment. I do not know if this is related to taking Benicar.

New doctor told me that Benicar had done permanant damage to venous return in legs and would have chronic swelling in legs. this was 10 years ago and I now have to take diuretics to control swelling. also, hsve venous dermatitis due to chronic swelling. wish I had changed to a doctor that listened to me sooner.

"I have been on Benicar for a year and a half. It has done an excellent job brining my blood pressure down, however over the past month I have experienced the following symptoms. Light nagging headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, numbing of arms, tingling of feet and hands and once my face went numb. Feeling like I am having a heartattack mostly in the middle of the night when I wake up and I have shortness of breath and numbing arm then palpatations and sweating. Very scary. The diziness has gotten worse and it is taking a toll on my quality of life, I am exhausted. The only thing I have done differently since I started Benicar is I began an excercise program about a month ago. walking and weights, this is when I began noticing the side effects so I thought maybe I didnt need as much of a dose so I cut in half. Blood pressure went up..... confused about why I am having side effects now, but I am having what everyone else is having on this site. Kind of a delayed reaction but a scary ones. Also feeling very paniced all the time. Have doc appt on Monday and plan to discuss trying something else. I hate it because it controlled my blood pressure. Thanks for sharing this I was beginning to think something else was wrong, maybe I can switch meds and everything go back to normal. Did I mention nausea? I guess from the dizziness.... ",5
 i experience a lot of diarrhea,4
"After trying a few other types of BP med. that made me dizzy or horribly sleepy this one is not so bad so far (2 months)I do not cough, I have mild sleepiness during the day and it helps me fall asleep at night when I take it.

"I used Benicar and within a month I started itching and breaking out.  It started as small circles and they began to get bigger.  I went to my doctor thinking I caught something at the gym or elsewhere.  She could not figure it out.  I went to her 3 times before I was sent to a dermatologist.  That doctor looked up the side effects of Benicar and found it does cause break outs on the skin. Once I stopped taking it, then my rash began to go away.  Of course I changed medication. I am not taking Diovan and all is well. Check side effects of  medication(s) you are taking.  ",1
Withdrawal symptoms from not taking my Benicar HCT,4

"Blood Pressure at 156/98.  Started with 20mg with HCT daily 6 years ago.  Blood pressure went too low within 4 months (dizzy and tired), so  Doctor cut HCT. Three years later, blood pressure down too low again so Doctor cut 20mg to three days per week.  I check my BP daily and is now at 117/72.  Insurance does not cover, but $80 is manageable when 30 pills now last 3 months.    ",5
"very expensive, especially when you have no insurance",5

The cardiologist and dermotoligist both insisted that this medicine 20mg was not the cause of my hair loss.  I lost about 50% of my hair and it was coming out in clunks for 6 mos.  I told my primary and he told me to stop taking it and changed my medicine to bystolic 10mg and my hair loss stopped immediately.  If your doctors don't listen to you - CHANGE!,1

"I have been exercising and have lost 13 lbs. I take 20 mg of benicar a day for past 3 months (use to take 40 mgs). My heart seems to be skipping a beat every now and than. No particular time of day nor reason for it to happen. dont know if cause is by medicine or coffee intake 3-4 cups a day. Cutting back on coffee now,  2 cups a day.

"My BP was 138/96 when I started taking Benicar 20mg three weeks ago. After the first week I rechecked my BP and it was 134/82. I've been having lots of dizzy spells, especially after I eat. It's not when I suddenly stand up, it's when I'm sitting, or standing or just any time. I've been taking it before bed and I wake up nauseated and have a slight headache. I started cutting my pills in half, so now I'm taking 10mg at night now. The nausea has gone as well as the headaches. But the dizziness, it's to the point I'm afraid I will pass out. My pupils have been very constricted, and yesterday I was retaining a lot of fluid. I quit drinking alcohol a week ago, and have started a minimal exercise routine. I've put on 5 pounds in the 3 weeks I've been on Benicar. I skipped my dose last night and will check my BP at work again. I've been told by my Dr's nurse that all my symptoms were ""normal"" and my body was simply getting used to the drug, but I think she's wrong, especially the dizziness. It may be a normal side effect, but it's NOT a good one. I've read I need to contact my Dr if severe dizziness occurs, so I'll be talking to her today about it. I can't keep using this drug!",3

I was diagnosed with hypertension at age 43 have been on Benicar 40 mg for the last 6 years. Low back pain-nausea-weight loss-headaches-excess mucous harsh chronic cough-can not get my dyastolic number down stays 90-100. ,2
"I was on 40 mg of Benicar for about 9 years, blood pressure was doing great, no problems but because was switched to Lorsartan Pot 100 mg a day and blood pressure is not as good as while I was Benicar.",5
"Stomach ache when bending, occassional vomiting.",4
controls blood pressure 137/74 Does it have effect on pulse rate,4
"Kidney failure!  This is a very dangerous medicine.  Cold and clammy.  I thought I was dying with one pill.  Thought that was crazy, the next day I tried it again, same thing happen. cold, clammy kidneys quit working. No more for me.  Be careful taking fish oil too.  Cholesterol way up, weight gain in belly. Dry mouth too.",1
Good,5
noticed extreme rxn to salt inraising BP. ,2
its an ok drug its not keeping my blood presure down,3
It works great for my blood pressure.  However I have a chronic coughand excessive mucous.,5
what are the side effects,3
I have not started this medication yet.,1
"Within 8 hours of taking first pill , bp went normal. Now avg of about 120 / 75. Heart rate down also. exercising and eating better. Using astaxanthan. Eyesight much better now. ",5
What is the cost of this drug,3
I have been taking Benicar 20 MG along with HCT 25MG for about 17 months now.  Today 7/27/2011 was the first time I experienced severe dizziness to almost passing out (it is over 95 degrees outside). My BP was 126/64. I dialed 911 but hung up because the condition subsided after I lied down for about 15 minutes.  I am so glad I was not traveling on Subway or Bus today. Overall it is very successfull in lowering my BP (140/90 to 126/76)  ,4
"I take 20 mg/day and of all the B.P. meds I've been on, Benicar has been most effective in lowering my pressure. Unfortunately, after almost 2 years I'm having B.P.readings almost too low, dizziness, headache, muscle & joint pain, itching and rashes when exposed to sun. When my pressure drops to 95/58, I just wilt and, if not actually, come near to passing out. No insurance right now as husband was laid off. ",5
Having bad dreams.  Am feeling very tired at times.,4
Works well for high blood pressure but causes very dry mouth.,4
"I agree with Fairbanks that Bystolic in combo with Benicar is very effective in controlling BP..sometimes too effective. The side effects of sun sensitivity ,ED and fatigue are tough to take, but workable at this point.",5
"In combination with Bystolic, Benicar has been the most effective of the many medicines I've tried to lower my blood pressure over the past 15 years. Happily, my BP is now at a very acceptable level. The one distressing side effect is that the Benicar has caused a pronounced intolerance for sun. Even short amounts of exposure will cause extreme itching and permanent discoloration of the affected skin. The itchy skin seems to be getting progressively worse every summer that I'm exposed to sunlight (thank goodness I live in Alaska and have 8 months of winter!).",5
"I tried 2 other HBP drugs that had too many side effects.  Benicar's only side effect on me was a slight effect on my equilibrium.  Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything.",5
"Taking 40 mg daily for two weeks. Blood pressure has gone from 120/78 to 165/91. Started taking Furosemide 40mg at same time. Increased Furosemide from one pill to two pills daily in second week. Was taking Tribenzor 40 but, it caused fluid retention.",1
Been on benicar for 15 months and only slight leg cramps. Bp is perfect while on it. No interaction with my simvistatin or seraquel. Very happy with product.,5
it is great for 3yrs could not get blood pressure down with this drug benicar/hct is the greatest i am more at ease with a low low reading ,5
"Thought it was working as my BP was low but didn't check that all the problems I started having were from Benicar.  Side effects I experiences are, joint and muscle pain, weakness and stiffness and cramps in legs and arms(felt like the muscles were going to break),irregular heart beat.  Origionally had feeling that I couldn't swallow but that went away after a couple of months.  I try not to read the symptons so I don't imagine I have them but glad I finally read and see I have the same reaction that I had with lisinopril. Cut down to .5 mil..bp ok and dr appt in 2 days. on for ",2
I have concerns about Benicar causing me to have high blood sugar. I am now getting a prognosis from my doctor of Pre-diabetes and she has prescribe 500mg of Metformin once daily.,4
"coughing,tightness in chest,wheezing,nausea,feeling abnormal,fatigue",3
"it works well but i want to know if it takes your potassium level down, and how fast it does it.",4
"I have been taking benicar for 5 years with no side effects except occasional leg cramps at night. I now know the leg cramps were due to the benicar because my insurance will no longer pay for it. Leg cramps stopped when they switched me to 100mg Losartan (Cozarr). BUT Now my blood pressure was 270/130 and my doctor wanted me to go straight to the ER. Dr. put me back on Benicar, some insurance will put you back on this drug if you fail at an ace inhibitor and a drug like Losartan.",4
"I am currently on Benicar 5mg which works well for me but, lately I have been light headed and headache (had recent Ct and it was normal) could this be a side effect of this med? Also like many others I have done the three step program before being prescribed Benicar but, my insurance refuses to pay for it. Like so many others",5
"I have suffered no ill effects from this medicine. I take 20 mg daily. So far no interactions with other meds. I don't take any other BP or cardiac meds, just for MS. I have been taking benicar for about 6 years and so far so good",5
"Made me feel so much better. Relaxed, don't have that feeling of anxiety.",5
"After about six weeks on 20mg once a day had foot soreness and discomfort in the left heel and knee, almost limping. Cut my dosage in half to 10mg daily and soreness is more manageable providing I use an ankle support and shoe insoles. Plan to ask my doc to maybe switch to something else.    ",4
has work great for me.but now my insurance  refuse to pay,5
Was ineffective in managing my hypertension.  Dr. switched me to Avapro and results are effective and uneventful.,1
"tiredness, pai9n  and heviness in legs.",4
I take my pill every day. My reading goes from 179 to 128 on top and 84 to 103 on bottom. I have started shaking. I quit this medication yesterday.,1
"I have had dehydration, limb numbness legs,ARM and hands",3
I am just wondering if some side effects could be a feeling of not being connected in my head Desentize,4
"its been good, I just need to know when a person can weaned themselves off the benicar permanently",4
"I have been on 20mgs for about 5yrs.My cholesterol is off the charts,perfuse sweating, and constant body aches. I now have horrible acid reflux as well.I have tried other meds and have abdominal issues that don't go away, so I have stayed on this. I don't know what to do!! My doctor is at a loss too!! Anyone have any suggestions? Help!!",5
 cost out of line,5
I have just started taking this drug for high blood pressure. I would like to know the side effects. I stay so tired and have no energy. Tell me what else might help.,2
3 months after starting this med alongf with Bystolic I find that my hair is thinning extremely bad.  Also have dizziness upon standing esecially in PM and my hands shake very badly.  Does anyoneknow about the hair loss and if it comes back with stoping the meds> ,3
this is best blood pressure med. i have taken,4
"spider veins, hair loss, circulation arrested in legs",3
"very satisfied with this drug, very expensive, looking for a generic",4
"I've been on Benicar 40 HCT 12.5 for about 9 months now. I have occasional pain in one knee. Although I had this problem prior to Benicar, the pain seems more severe now. Every now and then an occasional migrane headache. Overall I still like this drug. I found that daily cardio exercise is the key to any sluggishness and fatique. Side effects to Benicar appear to be minimal to none. I wish it were more affordable. Even with insurance the co-pay is way too high. ",5
I have been taking this medication about 3 yrs.  My main concern is itching.  I have little blisters that itch alot.  I also have a cough at night.,3
"Muscle pain,weak neck muscles,sore throat and eye socket discomfort.I thought it was the statin I was taking so I switched.No differance.So I went off the Benicar 20mg tab and all the issues are gone. I've been off for 8 days on.",4
Taken along with toprol xl,5
I have been on this medication for 4 years. At the beginning I had very serious dizziness and vertigo. That has subsided. However for the last 4 months I have been sufering from sexual dysfunction. My doctor wants to blame my age and menopause. Any drug can have a cumulative effect. Maybe it is time to change doctors....,4
"My 100 mg. daily Metoprolol that I had taken 2X a day  for 30 years stopped working for my high b.p. Doc prescribed one drug after another to take with the Metoprolol and all gave bad side effects including water pills I could not tolerate. He put me on Benicar a very expensive ARB class drug - one of the newer meds.  It is currently a popular b.p. drug supposed to keep strokes from occurring and good for diabetics. (I am not a diabetic). What I experienced the entire month on this drug was an absolute NIGHTMARE and CHANGE IN PERSONALITY.  At first I slept soundly in several naps a day, morning afternoon and night - got very little done, but sleep was sound! Then the sleepiness morphed into NO APPETITE, could hardly get food down and lost 10 lbs that month as a result. VISION difficult to focus, and the WORST WERE THE HEART PALPITATIONS AND MENTAL AFFECTS. I COULD NOT FOCUS MY MIND, SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS, NO AMBITION - APATHY IN WHAT WAS GOING ON around me. CREATIVITY was squelched! Felt like a zombie! This is the worst b.p. med I have ever taken. And the 20 mg. pill only brought down my b.p. moderately - 150 over 100 - not goal!  Yesterday, I pleaded doctor to take me off this poison - he did. Now I am starting on Clonidine - so far so good! What a relief! Praying this one works out in less side effects as time goes on. If you take Benicar be sure to monitor it closely as perhaps these side effects could sneak up on you as they did me! Shameful big pharma for letting this one on the market!",2
At first my blood pressure would be sky high and i would fax my doctor the results every three hours.  She told me to just continue taking which i did my bp has gone down a lot compare to 159/97 now its 120/80 or below.  ,5
On Drug for 90 days... BP was great but was dizzy EVERY time I would stand up!!!! almost fell four times. No sex drive.,3
i tried other med and they made me cough a lot,5
"It worked to bring my blood pressure down, but always feeling run down and achy.  And YES to Dolly, my last batch has a funny smell to it, almost like a sweat/sour smell.  Now I see the cholesterol thing, got appointment with Doc and thanks to switching insurance plans, Benicar is on a higher tier, so cost is to high, so will be switching. ",4
"I wrote a review just last week after finding that Benicar had raised my cholesterol over 100 points in less than a year.  I also found that there was foot pain associated with taking this drug.  I've been off of it 1 week now, and the foot pain is gone!  The dr has me on Diovan now, so hopefully my cholesterol numbers will go back down to normal.  The Mayo Clinic web site lists the hypercholesterolism (large amounts of fat in the blood) as a rare side effect they found in clinical trials.  So,  please get your cholesterol checked often if you are taking Benicar, and beware of foot pain- it's probably also from the Benicar!",4
"Became VERY, VERY tired while taking this drug. Also sweat alot. The last couple of bottles(used mail order drug company for this medicine)had a very strange odor. Was wondering if anyone else had notice this strange odor coming from their medication or maybe there was something wrong with the medicine I received. Could explain my severe fatigue. Worst feeling I have ever had. No longer taking this. Would not recommend anyone taking Benicar. Felt so bad I would rather risk a heart attack than take Benicar and deal with the fatigue.",3
"am 49 years old am on 40mg 1 pill a day wake up sweating on back of head, body pain feet,lower back,coughing, sore throat,nasal drip.and sex driver.need to stop taking linked to cancer",2
Overall I had not had any problems or side effects while using Benicar 40mg. I have been using it for three years.,4
"I thought Benicar was doing a good job- my BP was back in an acceptable range, after several other BP meds raised my readings or caused swelling.  Then I had my cholesterol checked on a routine physical.  After 8 months on Benicar, my cholesterol readings increased by 101 points!!  I've always had very low cholesterol readings, now it's at 218!!  And now I'm reading about the side effects others are having, and realizing that the pain in my feet, legs and joints may be from the Benicar as well.  Maybe also the recent heart burn- I've never had that before.  It started out just fine, but am calling the Dr about the Benicar -cholesterol connection.  Any one else have that problem??",4
I have been on Benicar for high blood pressure for over 5 years now and I've been very happy with it.  I take 20mg 1x day and it works fine.  The only problem that I have with this medicine is that I have lots of night sweats.  I will wake up during the night and I'm soaked as if I had just ran a marathon.  I was once taken off this medicine and I got VERY ill!  I have never tried that again with my doctor.  I am very pleased!,4
"I have been on Benicar for years and in the past year spent many months with neurologists performing every test they could to determine symptoms such as tingling and numbness in left hand, arm, foot and around mouth all on left side.  I also experience a burning sensation on scalp, leg and toe cramps as well as insomina.  I am amazed that I am reading others have had same symptoms on this drug!  My pharmists told me yesterday that as of 6/2010 there is a BLACK BOX warning on this drug relating to cancer and heart failure.  WHY IS THIS NOT MENTIONED ON THIS WEB SITE??????",4
"I have been on Benicar 40mg for 3 months and my blood pressure is still high. I've had bronchitis for a month with a severe cough. Also, I am sweating profusely all the time even when I'm not active. Going back to the dr. for the sixth time since August 1. I'm thinking of changing doctors.",3
"After a couple of weeks on a low dosage, I experienced tingling sensations in my left arm and leg, a burning sensation on my scalp (and hair loss), nasal irritation, and a feeling of arthritis in my right toes.  None of this has occured prior to this.  Will be requesting a change of meds this week.",4
"BP seems to be under control. Having right arm discomfort, left pain in the big toe, middle and third toe. Getting ready to switch. Also read in a medscape article that ARBs (benicar is an ARB) in general have been linked to lung cancer. Has anyone else read that or heard that?",4
"Seems to have lowered BP over last 3 years of 40 mg daily but this last year, foot pain, joint pain, muscle ache, and lower back pain.  Asked dr to go off it and see if these issues go away.  Just started withdraw today.  Dr. does not think Benicar is the cause of these aches and pains.  I am on Bsytolic 10 mg too and Norvasc 10 mg. ",4
"I was on Lisinopril, however, I developed a cough. I am now on benicar. I still have a cough but it is less severe. I have been on benicar for about 4 months and I just started having right arm discomfort with some numbness and tingling in my right hand. I also am having foot pain and aches in my hip, leg, and back area. I believe that the benicar is causing these symptoms. I will be monitoring.",4
"Have MVR, been on Benicar for three years. Has kept blood pressure down, but have many side affects. Side affects include severe itching, cough, hair loss, weight gain, achy bones and muscles, runny nose, and only with 10mg.",3
"HAVE BEEN ON 20 MG FOR 5YRS NOW BLOODPRESSURE VERY GOOD, CHANGED TO LISINOPRIL 40 MG, DIDNT WORK BLOOD PRESSURE WENT WAY UP, BENICAR IS AWESOME!",5
"I for one have been very satisfied with this drug. I have not had any symtoms becuase of it. I'm on 40mg/25mg hct. But back in 4/2010 I stated to work out at Gold's Gym. In 6/2010 I decrease my BP Med by half and my BP has remain within the same readings as if I was taking the full dose. Diet and exercise does help to reduce your BP. After a work out mine has droped as low as 74/56. Also since i stared working out I have been able to drop my weight by 45lbs. My goal is to drop another 25lbs and then try and go without my BP Med for a bit to see how I handle that. Yes I still like to eat at the buffets :-) from time to time, but I keep that in check by working out. I have been able to work myself up do doing 6 miles total on the summit and eliptical machine combined in one sesson(1.5 hours). I work out 3-5 days aweek. When I burn out I take a week off, then go back. Well I feel so good about writing this...I think I'll go do another 6 miles. Remember Diet and exercise are the key. No Bread No sugar, and stay away from the fast food places as much as possible.",5
"After 3 years on Benicar(40mg)along with catapres, controlled bp very well. Side affects after 6 months were lower pack pain on and off every couple of months. Worst was right shoulder pain that got worse after 1 year. So bad that I could not raise a quart of milk above my waist and do a push up. After discontinuing med, after 1 week, shoulder pain vanished, 2 weeks latter I was doing over 25 push ups. Back pain is also gone. I have been able to work out pain free and lost 42 pounds since Jan. Needed to switch meds since my bp was getting higher and it's effectiveness stopped. Switched to a new bp med called Bystolic which after 7 months has been great for me with no side effects (so far)",4

"Has lowered my bp, Am overweight but just realized that my ""allergies"", dry skin and aggravation of extreme low back pain of arthritis may not all be from overweight Since the med is too expensive, I will change but dread because tried two others that did not work because of side effects. Also went through terrible spell of dizziness. No reason found.",4

"Been on this med. for 4 yrs. and it did help in lowering mg BP, until late last yr. that i felt a brain jolts in my scalp, it's like a popping sound, so weird, then later on i had a migraine. When migraine went away, popping sensation has lessened a lot, until recently it went back and very evident when i'm lying on bed ready to go sleep. This med. made me dizzy and lightheaded so doctor advised me to take it at bedtime, so the popping occurs while lying ready to go sleep. Just recently I also had abnormal EKG (eversince have normal EKG), so i went through a lot of cardio tests but all turned out normal. Worried bec. it's my head and heart that bothers me now.

"Benicar has been great for me.  I don't have real high blood pressure, but it helps for what I do have.  HOWEVER, due to the change in my insurance it has become too expensive to continue on.  It's a shame they have to jack up the prices on drugs they know people need to survive.  Dreading the switch",3

Thus far, I have had no botherson after effects. The drug is expensive, $100+ for 30 days, but for me it is very effective and worth the price.

"Tried several different Rx's eg toprol, and lisinipril. I didn't like their side effects and minimal effectiveness. No side effects with benicar and the BP is well controlled - from 180/110 to 120/70. I finally find an effective medication with no apparent side effects and guess what? Anthem BC/BS wants me to use a different medication. Since when do we allow MBA's to make decisions for our doctors? And I always thought the BS stood for Blue Shield!",5
Side Effects:  Leg Cramps when not taking in enough fluids.   Plus side:  Blood pressure reduced from 180/105 to 120/70 withing 30 days.  Drug is not fast acting but great once a therapeutic level is reached.,5

"Benecar by itself did not keep my blood pressure down, so I have been using a calcium channel blocker with it.  I recently read that Benecar could cause bladder and kidney problems, and my bladder (chronic cystitis) has been getting worse and worse, so I discontinued Bemnecar and bladder has been much better.  My liver enzymes have also been elevated for unknownn reasons, so I wil see if going off of Benecar helps that. ",3
"I was using hydrochlorothiazide, dr. said my potassium was low, and switched me to  benicar olmesartan medoxomil. With the hydrochlorothiazide, bp was normalish, 120/80,127/82, but this benicar shot up to 150/110, dull headache, hard to concentrate. Benicar got me scared enough to go buy a bp monitor. My neck and scalp, have been itching like I have an alergy, can't prove it, but I think it is the benicar, and I feel weird, arm pain, and leg pain, like a walking stroke victim on my right side, hasn't helped me.I took for 1 month. My BP went up.My new Dr. put me back on the hydrochlorothiazide, and we will use a potassium suplement. I wasn't scared for my life with the hydroclothiazide. ",1

"I was on Benicar 40 (for 2 wks), then reduced to 20 for 3 weeks and I truly believe that Benicar is responsible for the onset of Panic Attacks (never had prior).  I'm off the Benicar now, but my side effects were so bad that I spent 3 weeks not able to get out of the bed.  Sore throat, lost 13 pounds, muscle aches, heavy limbs, general fatique, dizziness, inconsistent BP with some major drops.  Went to the ER twice with 2 of the more intense panic attacks.  Been off that med (now on lisinipril) for about 2 1/2 months, but I still don't feel 100% myself or well and think I've hung on to some of the anxiety.  I would never recommend this drug and wish that I'd never taken it.",3
"I had to drop down from 20mg to 10 mg because my BP was too low.  Now I am finding after 2 months that it is not staying down in the afternoon.  I will discuss taking 10 mg in am and 10 mg in pm.  Also, being a person with chronic anxiety, it has increased my anxiety 100% - back to where it was unmanagable when I was 15.  My doctor does not want to change it because she thinks it is not affecting my anxiety.  I may switch doctors.  You have to be your own advicate and I know my body.",3
"I have been taking Benicar CHT 40-12.5mg plus my HB Lipitor, in the last 2 weeks I have been experiencing the following side effects, blurry vision, feeling very tire, sleepy.

"I am a 62 year old female who is 5' 3"" and weigh 126 lbs, with a history of high BP.  Tried Lisinipril and had GI reaction to it.  Started out on 20mg of Benicar and was very light headed and dizzy and so tired I didn't want to get out of bed. My BP dropped too low, so I cut the pills in half and had same effects and same low BP.  So I cut the pills in half again (5mg) and now the BP is stable around 130 over 75.  I did that about 10 days ago. The dizziness and shortness of breath is gone, but I have a dry cough, now.  I am having sore muscles in my feet, but I am not sure that is the Benicar.  I like the lowered BP, and my energy is better on the low dose.  I am going to give this more time and see if the cough persists.  I cough a lot at night! I am in ""wait and see"" mode, but at 5mg, the drug is effective with little in the way of side effects.  If this is like Lisinipril, it will take a few months to discover if there are any persistent side effects.",4
Have been taking Benicar for about 4 mos.  I have light headiness/dizziness all the time.  Get very hot and sweat profusely.  Cough all during the day and night.  My vision has gotten worse.  Stays blurred most of the time. I have complained to my doctor and today has me scheduled for a CT Scan and carotid artery test.  Now I'm not so sure it isn't Benicar causing these symptoms. ,4

I took this drug at the lowest dosage but it didn't control my blood pressure.  When the dosage was increased it caused me to be short of breath and caused lower back pain.,1
"I was prescribed Benicar 20 mg. after an episode that send me to the ER.  BP was 150/96 which is very high for me. The BP is controlled and sometimes drops too low  ( 92/56 ). The most troubling side effects are extreme dizziness, headaches, increased perspiration, and the feeling of hot flashes. I feel irritable and impatient which is not me. I have always seen the ""glass half full"".  I am seeing my Dr. this week to see if I could cut the dosage.  I have tried taking the meds in the morning and at night with no difference. I do know there is a big difference if I do not take with food. Side effects much worse on an empty stomach.",5
"Since starting Benicar feeling very tired all of the time, some sob and annoying dry cough.  Also abomen has become very large.  Overall hate taking this med but it does control my bp.",5

I have been taking this med for about 4 months because of very high bp.  All of a sudden I have been having sickening dizzy spells yet all my vitals are very normal.,4
I have been taking Benicar for approximately 8 months.  I started with 10 mg/day but my blood pressure was too low so I cut back to 10 mg every other day and my blood pressure has stabilized around 120/80. I haven't noticed any unusual side effects.,5
"i've been using it for about two years , my blood pressure is 120/84 constant , outside of sexual desire loss ( i have been married for 26 yrs ) it has worked great...",4
"While taking this Benica I have experienced fatigue, dizzy, sweating, and I get overly hot. My blood pressure at times drops too low. I am on 20ML. Blood pressure medication is scary. Going back to my doctor for a different med.",3
HAD KIDNEY FAILURE DUE TO THIS DRUG,3
"sleepiness, tiredness. Another doctor says that I do not to take this drug.",3
I HAVE TAKEN BENICAR FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS.  I ALSO TAKE ZOCOR FOR CHOLESTEROL.  THE FIRST YEAR I HAD LOTS OF SINUS INFECTIONS.  THEY HAVE SUBSIDED NOW BUT I THINK THE SINUS WASHES I HAVE DISCOVERED @ WALMART.,5
"After 6 weeks, my BP has only gone down less than 10 points total.",2
I have been on Benicar for 2 months.  Since the start my blood pressure has gone from 165 to 114.  I have had no noticable side affects.  My cardioligist is satisfied and has asked me to continue with the drug.  I watch my diet and exeercise.,5
"75 yrfemale-on Benicar for 4 weeks,BP has not decreased too much.Took Diovan for 2 years no decrease in BP.Then on Coreg that caused severe Vertigo and Nausea. Benicar causes drowsiness and fatigue.I am 5'7 and weigh 124 lbs.Reminded MD. that most medications affect me more because I am thin.I am very active and have no other med.problems just high BP that seems to be genetic.I am afraid to try any more drugs due to the horrible side effects of Coreg!",3
Sometimes blood pressure drops....making me dizzy,5
"While Benicar (20 mgs.) has helped my high blood pressure, I am having other difficulties. My legs ache constantly, my right arm stings from my wrist to my shoulder and my joints are extremely sore.",5
I take benicar 40 with clonidine twice a day .2.  Clonidine puts me to sleep.  I have had only a little dissiness at times with benicar.  My blood preasure fell from 280/200 to 240/180 or to /180/114 which varies depending on stress.  I have been on benicar for 1 and 1/2 years.  My blood chemistry is better than it ever was and it is helping my kidneys.   The only problem is my Benicar comes from India by way of Canada where it costs me 100 instead of 270 in the us at walmart due to patent problems in the us.  I am a senior and money matters to me,3
"Started 20mg on 11-12-08 for BP. On 12-9-2008 went to Doc with server cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Diagnosed with Asthma and prescribed prednizone, proventil, levaquin and Advair discus. Treatment worked for about as long as I was taking prednizone. However, as a type II diabetic my sugar level went out of sight.  Returned to Doc and he gave me another round of the same treatment with no better results.  After reading many reviews on the web, I have began to think Benicar could be my problem.  As of today, I will stop taking Benicar and see if the symptoms improve. I thing they will. I don't think my Doc will accept it very well but I am ultimately responsible for what I choose to put in my body and believe this to be a bad drug.  I have never had asthma symptoms in my life until taking this durg and immediately started a severe cough and trouble breathing. I will review later and give the results.",4
"I HAVE BEEN ON BENICAR 20MG FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS NOW, IT HAS NOT REALLY HAD MUCH IMPACT ON MY STANDING BLOOD PRESSURE (140/85) BUT REALLY HELPS WHEN I EXCERCISE.  I AM VERY ATHLETIC.  I HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY SIDE EFFECTS OTHER THAN SWELLING FEET AND SOME MINOR WEIGHT GAIN.  i WAS SHCKED TO SEE NO ONE ELSE REPORTED WEIGHT GAIN.  THE JURY IS STILL OUT THOUGH AS I THINK TWO MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO JUDGE.",3
"pStarted med in Nov. 2008 and felt good at first since it did lower my bp. As time passed, though, I began to feel various symtoms; a chronic cough, trouble breathing, sinus congestion, headache, neck muscle pain, fatigued/sleepiness. Recently, I went to the Dr. for stomach pains/inflamation, and rectal bleeding.  It tested positive for blood in the stool and a CT Scan was ordered and was shocked to find out I have liver problems among other things, like sugar in the blood, high level of creatinine, and bladder/UTI problems.  None of which I previously had a problem with.  I do not take any other medication on a regular basis, so I attribute these symptoms directly to the Benicar HCT, especially after reading the side effects that coincided with my symptoms and that regretfully I read after the fact. Don't make the same mistake I did, excusing the symptoms with other causes you think it might be.  Always read the contraindications and side effects first, so you can determine early what truly caused you the problems. Consequently, I don't know how all this will turn out for me in the end, but I sure hope that there is no permanent damage to any of my vital organs. I will not be taking this med anymore, that's for sure.",3
I was diagnosed with moderate high blood pressure (165 over 85).  The cardiologist prescribed Benicar 20mg.  Within a week my bp has receded to 118 over 69.  I monitor  every day and notice an increase if I eat a salty meal or imbibe wine. A heathy diet and exercise along with Benicar seem to work wonders for me.,5
Controls BP better than Diovan 160mg.  I have had a little dizziness but nothing serious.,5
"I seem to be a little tired, but not like I use to be.  I was wondering if anyone has experience getting gout while on this medication.",5
"This is a great medication.  The only problem is - it's very difficult to get my insurance company to pay for this medicine when I need a new prescription.  I have to go through a big process to get my dr. to send in paperwork, then the insurance company has to review it; this can take up to 72-96 hours before I know whether I can get the new prescription.  Why is this so difficult?  I am on Medicare, with diabetes and COPD; also past history of CHF and pulmonary embolism.  I just don't see why this med is so hard for the insurance company to approve.  I have no problem getting the rest of my meds filled, why Benicar!!!!!!!!",5
"Was on Accupril, but had chronic cough. No cough with Benicar and controls BP better. Now doing 3 months mail order to reduce cost. I bought a automatic BP cuff so I can monitor BP between doctor visits.  It's good biofeedback.  I can see how a salty meal affects my BP.  Can also see how moderate walking helps.  Some sexual issues that I never had before (vaginal dryness, probs with the big ""O""), but not sure if it is age, the meds, or my boyfriend! LOL! :)",5
I was taking beincar for vavular disease it caused my B/P to bottom out and I fainted while eating out with a friend. ,1
"I have spells of dizziness, feel week, and unusually tired.",4
"I don't, know what it's doing to my body.",3
On this 5 yrs at 10 mg daily.  Did great till I upped to 20 mg daily and it controls BP great but I have a slow heartrate and at times it feels weak and I stay tired and dizzy most of the time.,3
 no side effects-- great,5
"While bending over one morning, I became very dizzy and light headed. I was working in the heat. I had only eaten a danish for breakfast. My b/p was 99/61 when I took it at home. Why did I have hypotension if I suffer from hypertension?",5
"I STARTED TAKING 40ML.WORKED OK BUT I WAS SO SLEEPY ALL THE TIME.TRIED TAKING AT NIGHT,WOKE UP STILL FATGUE.ALSO CAUSED LOSS OF SEXUAL DESIRE.DOC SWITCHED ME TO 20ML SIDE EFFECTS DECREASED PUT BP WENT UP.NOW TAKING EXFORGE 5/160 SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE NO SIDE EFFECTS YET BP 127/78",3
"In '02 hospitalized 3 days with pain across back shoulders and bp of 210/90. Given metalprolol ""just in case"" I had a heart problem, HCTZ and liptor. Liver enzymes were then out of control for several years. Went to the ER for pneumonia...was bronchitis, coughing 'til dizzy. BP 238/100. Given hydrocodone (for pain I didn't feel), musinex for my lung congestion. Urine smelled from musinex. Did break up cough. PCP prescribed lisinipril (cough became worse) lowered bp. Stopped it because of cough. Prescribed tessalon for cough and benicar 40mg. Took only 20mg for 3 days, 40mg 1 day. Second day tired and ached like I had the flu. Cough increased. Lost voice when talking. Sinuses filled, drained yukky green mucous, I was cold and sweating at same time, bowel movements changed, headache too. 12 hrs after taking 40mg bp lowered from 200/84 to 160/84. But coughing got worse. Read the pkg insert! Bronchitis is a side affect; flu-like symptoms a side affect; sinus infection a side affect; dizziness a side affect...I'm tired of being a guinea-pig for doctors who either don't know the meds well enough or don't know their patients well enough or dare I say don't care!!! I'm looking for an alternative type of treatment!!! Could some of us have high bp as a normal part of life?! There is no history of heart problems in my family on either side; and I've had all the tests, scans, etc. I think I'm DONE with MD's and prescription meds that do more harm than the disease!",2
"this medication along with atenolol and amlodipine has significantly lowered my blood pressure, however one of these medications is causing me to have red spots that itch severely.",5
i have a blood pressure problem it runs high and drops for no reason this has been working for me ,5
Dry nose and throat skin rash.  Fatigue.  Also taking Amlodipine,4

I have just started taking Bencar Tablets,2
Works as was told. No side effects and bp is 120/70,4
"Started on BENICAR 20 MG, blood pressure went down but ankles swelled and fingers. Dr put me on BENICAR HCT 20-12.5 (water pill) and its great. No water retention and blood pressure is 130/80 was 180/95. No side effects and have been on it 6 months.  Im on mail order and get 3 months supply (90 tablets) for only $30.00. Absolutely the way to go. ",4
My mother-in-law took this drug for 3-4 weeks and was always sleepy with no appetite. I had her go to another Doctor who threw it away. She is getting her strength back after 2 weeks and can now walk along. This reaction started right away so beware,2
"I was put on this medicine (20mg) 5 months ago and I was able to dramatically lower my blood pressure.  I had no side effects but the medicine is expensive.  I switched to Lisinopril (40mg) to save money but I had side effects (joint paint, rapid heart rate, fatigue).  I'm back to using Benicar.  I hope the price goes down or my blood pressure will really go up.",5
"Three years only thing that works for me, a bit pricey though or maybe my network provider is proud of it.",4
After 4 years my feet started swelling. ,5
SO FAR SO GOOD ,3
seems to be working but would like to know more abouit side effects,3
"I have been on Benicar for over a year.  Recently I switched to Lisinopril. Needless to say, I went back on the Benicar due to the side effects of Lisinopril.  I have had a few episodes of dizziness and morning nasal congestion.  I would rather deal with those side effect than the side effects I had with the Lisinopril. The Benicar controls my BP and I feel great..",5
Itchy skin with hives,4
"I have been on this medication for approximately 5 years..  I have not experienced any known side effects, although once or twice I did feel a little dizzy. But this could have been the result of some other issue.  Overall I believe this is a good drug, at least for me. The only bad thing is that it is quite expensive.",4
just started treatment,3
Started taking Benicar last Monday for high Blood pressure/ Since taking the med I am sleepy all of the time!!! It is even hard to keep my eyes open while driving!!! Very Scary! Will call doc Monday to get on something else for bp,3
"Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I can’t ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I don’t think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then…  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++",5
"2/9/09---71 yrs old---In very good health---On 10mg of Benicar every morning for 5 years now (only drug taken)--- No serious problems for 1st 4+ years, and then started gradually having strange apparent side effects----lips and tongue would alternately swell up BIG every few weeks; fatigue leading to naps (I never took naps before Benicar); joint pain in knees; very sore throat and loss of voice which lasted for weeks; new acid-reflux started; vision has become blurry; mild depression and anxiety; and finally small red itchy rashes formed on soft-tissue of underarms, crotch, buttochs and belly, alternating from week to week. Doctor (and I) could not find ANY reason for all these maladys! Blood pressure did drop from 140/90 to normal (or below) while on drug----but I decided that side effects were not worth it, so quit the drug 5 days ago----will see what happens---blood pressure has remained stable and normal, so far (I monitor closely). Not positive that drug is causing all these problems, but have no other explanation as I have never had any of these problems before Benicar.  I am not on any other drugs. Very suspicious, to say the least. Pretty scary.  ",4
"After trying several other BP medications, I have been on Benicar for a year.  I initially had dizziness.  Over the past 4 months, I have developed horrible muscle fatigue, tingling and numbness in my arms and sometimes my legs & feet, blurred vision and terrible shortness of breath.  Not sure what to do now.  My doc is very thorough but feels I must stay on this med.  I did not have any of these issues prior to this med.  I have also noticed weight gain and anxiousness.  Is there ANY natural dietary supplements that are proven to work with less side affects?  ",3
Has worked well without any side effects,5
"After readin other people's problems I can relate. I have tingling in fingers, especially at night, very low BP at times- like 85/55, dizziness and almost fainting at times when getting up, very low sexual desire and erectile problems. I take 20mg and am also taking spironolactone and hctz. Alot of side effects I worry about- but BP had been as high as 225/130. There has to be a better solution.",4
"I've been on this medicine for two years without any side effects except I do get a racing heart once in a while especially after drinking home brewed tea or coffee. If I do any hard exercise in the morning within a couple hours of taking it, I will get dizzy.  It's done me fine.",5
"some side effects including weakness, fatigue, inability to get an erection but the 40/12.5 dosage definetly got my bp under control and then some. Therefore all in all it does what it is meant to do so I can't fault it.",5
I have experienced numbness in my hands and feet as well as a decreased sexual ability while using this drug.,5
"I have been taking about 6 weeks. Was taken off Atenol which I took about 15 yrs which was making me lethargic. Benicar is controling my BP good. I have more energy, sleep better. So far, no side effects.",5
I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in the summer of 2006.  My average BP readings at that time were approximately 170/110.  After being prescribed several medications that were ineffective my doctor prescribed Benicar which did lower my BP.    I initially experienced dizziness and hazy vision as my body adjusted to the medication as well as ED issues.  Later on I began to experience numbness / tingling in my face and extremities difficulty berating lightheadedness and an intense feeling that I was about to pass out and the end was near.  These episodes landed me in the emergency room twice prior to me learning how to bear them patiently.   I have put up with the side effects for one year now and just today (1/5/09) I have requested that my doctor find me a different medication.  I am a little nervous about this decision because Benicar did lower my BP but I can no longer bare the side effects.,4
I have been using 10 mg Benicar for 4 months for high bp. I have recently started getting cough/shortness of breath if I miss a dose. Is cough a common side effect if a dose is missed? I have not felt any other side effects except that I need to take a nap during the day without which I cannot function properly. Has anyone who takes benicar noticed any weight gain ot loss while on it?,4
"LET'S SEE DIZZY, HARD STOOLS,MUSCLE PAIN,LOW OR NO SEX DRIVE, NIGHT VISION BLURRED.",2
I am still in the trial stage and just checking.,5
"benicar controls my blood pressure without side effects, but it is expensive to buy, so i need to find similar drug at less expense.",5
"I have experience non-stop dizziness for the whole 6 months of taking the medication, there was always feelings of light-headess and I even actually fainted two times. The last straw was the severe rash on my arm and stomach, and I was itching from what felt like the inside out all over my body. It was horrible!!!!! :(",5

treatment worked but after two years now have developed a dry cough.  is this a side effect?,4
"I have taken Benicar for about 3 years now and my biggest complaint is when I first started taking it, I had the worst headaches you could amagine. and tired. but it passes in about 2 weeks. If you can hang in there.",4
I began treatment for high blood pressure with Lisinopril.  I had a dry cough that kept me up at night after taking the med for approx 2-3 months.  Benicar has been much better and I feel great.,5
"After first starting this medication I developed significant heartburn, a severe cough and some itching.  The Dr. felt that the cough and itching may have been an interaction with the Pepcid Complete I was taking to treat the heartburn.  I now take the 20mg Benicar at night before bed and a Prilosec OTC first thing in the morning with a glass of water 30 minutes before breakfast and the coughing, itching and heartburn side effects have all gone away.  However, I do get some muscle cramps in my calves with exercise.  I have also noticed a loss of libido and had not thought about Benicar as a possible cause until reading some of the other reviews.  This may be an additional side effect that I just found out about.",5
I felt dizzy when I first started taking it. I also felt very lethargic for the first 8 hours after taking it. Now I take it in the evening and I feel much better during the day (not so tired).,5

"I have been using this medicine for 3 months and it has worked great.  I had tried Lisinopril with severe side effects, so I was thankful to find another med that works so well.",5
I was taking Cozaar for years and I had good results.  I retired and couldn't pay the price.  My doctor changed me to Benicar at my request which is 1/2 the cost of Cozaar.  Not a good move.  I have a chronic cough and so much itching skin.  I will trim the dose to 10MG and see if that works for me.  Otherwise adios to Benicar and I'll have to pay for Cozaar as there is no generic.  This website really helps.,4
high blood pressure,2
"40 mg for HBP 2 years on it. No hair loss.  4 other types of meds before this, all with side effects.  This one is effective.  All HBP lowering meds seem to have fatigue and dizziness side effects...that's something to be expected.  Others here seem to attribute unusual side effects to this drug.  IMO, likely something else is causing the far-fetched symptoms.  All react differently, but, the science does not support what is alleged here by others.",4
I have been on this medication for 6 weeks and so far have had no problems. My blood pressure is now: the high between 110 and 120 and the low is usually between 60 and 72...............,5
Took 20 mg for two weeks.  Blood pressure was not that good.  Dr. told me to take 20 mg twice a day.  I took one extra dose and felt sick.  I was dizzy and had a headache.  My sinuses bothered me for the whole time I took it.  My blood pressure soared when I first took it.  I am done with this drug.,1
Mid and low backache,4

I developed a cough from taking Lipisnol so I was perscribed Benical.  The cough persists and also I have sinus problems and have problems with bowel movements. I stopped the medication several days ago and thinking about asking my dr for direutic pills.  Is there a solution since I have tried 4 medications and all with side effects I could not tolerate.  ,1

"I experienced dizziness, tingling in my fingers, and a slower flow of urine.",1
"Started taking 20mg, having head aches.  Quit taking and Dr. told me to cut doseage in half, so I split the 20mg to 10mg.  Sometimes I have throbling in forehead.  BP under control but now inside of my legs beging to itch, though I might have been bitten by a bug, but no marks. This itching about two weeks. Don't know if this Benicar is doing this?  I take the Benicar at bed time and after awhile I feel cold and don't know if my system temp. gets too low?  Heart rate skips like flip flops but I change breathing and its settle down.  I do at time feels tired and naps a lot, I am 71 maybe the age factor is it?  Or the Benicar? I am still on it but if this continues, will drop this stuff and eat more garlic etc.",4

"I was prescribed Benicar for High Blood Pressure.   It caused such extreme itching, that my doctor prescribed another medication.   It was awful.",1
I have used Benicar for one month and two weeks. I have experienced an enormous amount of hair loss and knee and ankle pain.,3
Half the dose twice or three times daily is more effective.,5
Is it me or is my hair falling out like crazy?  It seems that every time I look around there is hair all over my clothes and I dont even need to shave my legs anymore.  My hair is like half of what is was in a very short time.  I think this is from Benicar as I stopped it before because I thought that and it got better and then gave it a try again.,3
"Aside from loss of libido, does anyone else notice depression?  I feel like I could lay on my bed and look at the ceiling for hours.  Not really fatigue, but no energy at all.  ",4
"I have been on Benicar for 2 years. For a few months, I noticed the sleepiness, but it's not bad now. It controls by BP very well-and I had tried several others without any success. However, I do notice the muscle/joint pain, although it improves throughout the day, but mornings are rough. I thought I had lost sexual desire because of the pain, but perhaps it's another side effect as well. Would love to know if taking it every OTHER day might help.",5
"After quitting several blood pressure regimes which caused heart beat irregularities I now take 40mg of Benicar plus a dirureatic.  Pressure is good and much more regular than before.  Noted lack of headaches, really bad joint pain (which I thought was arthritus until I read some of these comments) and general tiredness.  Would change because of the side effects if something else would keep the readings regular.",4
"I am experiencing a constant use of using the bathroom urinating.  Concerned about dehydration.   At night, I have extreme cramps in my legs",2
I have a bad cough that takes my breath away when I speaking.,2
My blood pressure is low despite taking 25 mg Atenolol and Benicar.  I stopped taking Lisinipril and don't understand why I am taking another pressure lowering med.  I need the side effects so I can discuss with my doctor.,3
"I took Benicar for 2 months and was in the hospital 4 times with vomiting,dehydration,slow heart beat.I was close to dying one time. I could not stand without fainting. I was sweating and very cold at the same time.It took 4 trips to the hospital to figure out it was Benicar that was causing all the problems. I have never had a problem with any other medicine before",1
My hair has been fall out and metropolil wes worse. Any suggestions for another drug for lowering BP without this side effect?,3
Too expensive for senior citizens.  Generic needed. ,5
"I have taken benicar for sometime now.My blood pressure is better, but my joints ache, And I get very hot. Also have diahreah..I need to go back and try something different again. They do have this in generic. I pay about 3 dollars a month for it. ",4
Can I eat grapefruit wiht this medication?,5
good,4
I have been taking this medication for 2 months.  The 2 side effects that I notice are being tired most of the time and sleepy most of the time.  I can get 7-8 hours of sleep a night and I am still tired and sleepy most of the day.  This may cause me to have to switch to a different BP medication.  It did lower my BP from 140/95 to 110/64 though.  I still cannot handle being this tired and sleepy every day.  ,3
"EXPERIENCING HEADACHES, LIGHTHEADED, JOINT PAIN.",3
my doctor just prescribe this medication to  me so i hope it helps ,4
This med has set me back years. I worked to lower with sucess my colestorol as well as my liver enzimes. In six months Benicar ruined all my efforts. I feel tired and my joints hurt all the time. I am very disappointed and have quit this med.,2
"Benicar was perscribed to me by my Doctor.  My blood pressure was normally 180/110.  About two week ago, I started taking Benicar.  I have terrible aches in all my joints, I have stomach pains, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach, sweat profushiosly, and my blood pressure plumits to 80/60.  I feel as though I am going to pass out.  I don't know which way to turn.  I gusess I'll go back to the Doctor, and spend more money on some other blood pressure medication.  Benicar is not the one for me.",1
"BP would drop too much, dizzy, severe joint pain.  I took it for several years with no ill effects, but physician raised my dosage from 20 mg to 40 mg.  Troubles Started!!! I would wake up in tears every morning from joint pain.",3
"I have been taking Benicar 40mg for 6 years.  I have tried alot of BP medicines, but none have worked as well as this one.  Some side affects: decreases sex desire and ability; standing up quickly on golf course...my head spins if sun is out and hot; I feel like I am going to black out.  Decreases your energy level. If you drink too much alcohol, it causes your heart rate to increase while you sleep.  If I get off this medicine, my BP goes right back up.  Even though I am taking it now...higher in the a.m.(165/90),  after the morning BP reduces to(140/80). I take the BP medicine in the a.m.  My experience w/ Benicar has been good, but there are a lot of negatives.  I wish I could get off all BP medicine.  I don't think it is good for anyone over the long-term. ",4
wonderful,5
"   When I first read some of these reviews I wasn't so sure that I wanted to take this med, but I gave it a try.    This is the 3rd med since Dec 07 and I finally have one that WORKS without any noticable or unwelcome side effects. My readings are nice & low and STAY that way. With some of the other drugs my readings fluctuated so much from shortly after I took it to 12 or 16 hours later. It seemed like it only worked short term, not the full 24 hours.    One (Lisinopril) left me with dry coughing spells that were so bad I was coughing up blood from the strain. The other (Diovan) caused a 10lb weight gain to my midsection and unacceptable elevated liver enzymes for which I underwent more testing. Once I stopped the med, my enzymes went back to normal.    Hopefully, I have come to the correct medication for me. The results so far have been good. Now I just hope it stays that way.",5
"Beginning B/P in ER was 184/111.  4 days later, B/P was 126/86 on 10 mg per day.  Started falling to 93/59, 99/60--felt dizzy and extremely tired.  A few days later diarrhea began, continued now for 11 DAYS, with very strange ""medicinal"" smell.  I feel it is the Benicar, since I NEVER have diarrhea until starting this med. It does work VERY well in controlling B/P but I CANNOT tolerate this daily diarrhea---interfering with work and electrolytes!  Dr out of town until Tues but will tell her I want off this med---diarrhea not a tolerable side effect for me. My feet also stopped swelling while on this medication, a definite plus, but can't take the diarrhea! ",5
 been taking benicar for several years. but here in the past few nights heart rate is skipping a beat every 10 to 15 seconds. WHAT UP WITH THIS? ,5
"Developed severe hives, needed 3 days of hospitalization.  MD changed med from avapro, which was working, because the insurance company sent him a letter saying the avapro was not a ""Preferred"" drug for the insurance company.  MD never told me why or any side effects.  Terrible med.",1
After using several weeks I lost my voice - it felt like I had a lump in my throat and I couldn't clear my throat.  Also felt extremely weak and tired.  I stopped using it and was prescribed another medicine.  ,1
it has controlled my blood pressure. I have taken it for six yrs,4
"I was on medication for a long time. All of a sudden I became nauutious and violently ill to my stomach with severe diarehha, cramping in feet and legs, chills, sweating and vomiting. After going off this medication I was fine. Due to high blood pressure they insisted i go back on and once again have became violently ill within 2 hours. I need help and can't seem to get answers.",1
the medicine side effects are drowsiness,5
"Started on 20 mg 6 years ago, right after it became available on the market.  Worked great at first.  Then side effects started to get worse and worse and bp started to creep back up.  Been battling high triglycerides for most of time on it despite taking statin.  They were fine before drug.  Side effects are not worth it and it is too expensive.  Dr refused to take me off it despite repeated requests, so I switched doctors and got on new med.",3
"Dropped from the 40 to the 20, but still having readings of 85/60. Prior readings were 140/90. Can't seem to find the ideal amount. Have been getting palpatations, especially at night-feels like extra heart beats and skips. I think this has also led to general lethargy. Don't think the tradeoff is worth it.",3
it helped lower my b/P,4
I have had high blood preasure for 36 years about 140/95. I have been taking clonidine. In the last two months it has gone to 250/180. I added Benicar 40 about 2 months ago.  My preasure is now 180/140.  It is just staying there after a freefall that was scary.  I can not get the bottom to go down so the top can go down.  My doctor got cold feet over it and wants me to go into a hospital even though it runs in my family and I have been fine for  years.  What to do. What causes this and I feel totally helpless and alone.,3
"I was started on Benicar 40mg about 3 years ago after experiencing mild elevations in blood pressure. Dosage dropped to 20 mg shortly after starting. Has worked well for me and keeps my BP within range even if I take only every other day.  Recently, blood work revealed elevated liver enzymes.  After reading some reviews about reported liver problems, I will address this with my physician.  Am awaiting new blood results. I appreciate other reviews stating they have reduced their mg dosage.  I will address that with my physician, too.  I always experience increased urination w/ this, but not too bad - controllable.",5
This was the absolute best BP medication I have ever taken but couldn't afford it. VERY expensive when you are only making 15G a year. Had to switch to Lisinopril which is working fine for me.,5
"I was on Benicar 20mg for several years.  My blood pressure was elevated and my dosage was changed to 40mg.  After a couple of years, I had severe pain in my heel and upper back.  I went back to the doctor several times about my heel, had it x-rayed and was told I have a small spur.(Not bad enough to cause so much pain) I asked her to change my bp medication.  Less than a week and all pain was gone.  2 1/2 months later back pain is back.  Heel is not bad. My doctor is working with me to try to find BP med that does not cause joint pain.  And I know that I have some problems with joints, but bp meds exacerbates it so much that I often wake up in tears.",4
i am more sleepier with it.. but other then that it works!!!,4
IT Works,5
I've been on it for at least a 2months.  It has worked for me.  I tried another med that made me cough alot.  I agree this med is very expensive.,4
I have been on this med for almost 2 weeks moving from Lisinopril which caused a dry cough.  I still have the cough and now I am constipated.  I have a Dr. appt. to change again.  ,3
I have taken Benicar since 2002 for hypertension. It seems to work well to keep my blood pressure fairly stable. Recently though the insurance company has made it very difficult to receive this drug because they want people on Benicar to take a generic replacement. My doctor claims there is none and we need to continue on this one. My husband takes it also. The main drawback is that it is quite expensive.,5
"Recently, I was admitted to the hospital because of leg numbness and severe leg muscle pain. It was thought to be a blood clot. Not so. I think it's the side effects from the the drug.  I will ask doctor to change at my next appointment.",2

I started on 20mg but uped to 40mg after a short while. Been taking it for about 1.5 yrs. BP still fluctuates but not over 140. Takes 20mg each (1/2 a pill) morning and late afternoon. Side effects not as bad as other meds. for BP I tried.,4
"This is my last day on it after just over a week.  I changed from Lisonopril becsuse of the bad dry cough.  Still coughing but no longer dry.  Raspy voise. Fatigue. I need to loose 10 pounds, but can't get off the couch, it won't happen this way.",1
This medication has not worked for me.,1
I have developed gout-like symptoms in my ankle/foot.  Could this be caused from the Benicar?  I have been on Benicar for four months and have had severe pain in ankle for about that long.  ,3
"I took this medication for 3 months. It made me very sick to my stomach, vomitting and very shaking with almost twitchy tremors. once I stopped, I felt a lot better. Now I am on Atenenol, lisinopril, and hdtz. Much better except for ED.",3
"Overall, very satisfied with results, however, remain tired all the time. Guess one thing outweighs the other.  ",4
"Facial flushing, redness with fine rashes & mild itches.",2
"Have been taking Benicar 40mg for about 4 years. Overall, it's worked well. BP still goes up & down like a yo-yo...but not near as high as it used to be. Worst side-effect is being tired and lack of energy at times...plus its made my ED problem worse. It's just a trade-off I guess.",4
"I was on the drug for 1 year and it helped reduce my blood pressure. However I developed severe diarrea that hospitalized me with dehydration. Doctors never could diagnose the cause, however I feel my body was reacting to the Benicar. I got off the Benicar for approx. 10 days. Once out of the hosiptal, I took 1 Flagyl and my Benicar. I developed  severe vomiting that I blamed on Flagyl even though I had no alcohol. After this no Benicar or Flagyl. Then I decided to take my Benicar again as I thought Flagyl was the problem. This time the same reaction to the Benicar 2 hours after taking it- sweating, vomiting, shortness of breath. This time I blamed it on my 6 year olds virus. No more Benicar for about 4 weeks, until I decide to take it again thinking ther is no way the Benicar is making me sick after using it for over 1 year with no problem. This time the reaction sends me to the ER. I experienced severe vomiting, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath, tingling and numbness in my hands. I am 38 years old and in great health- I thought I was going to die.",3

"Have been taking 10mg (20 split) 12 mos for mild hypertension.  Very effective. Mild exercise causes pressure to drop further so weight loss and conditioning might require lower dosage or might not be needed at all, but excepting that, keeps me in good range.  No obvious side effects.  Very satisfied.",5
Started on 20mg but had dramatic reduction in pressure. Leveled dosage at 5mg with excellent results.  Sexual disfunction may be a result of Medication or Lipitor taken for cholesterol.,5

Benicar will cause your extremities to lose natural color during sexual activity as blood flows elsewhere. Benicar will  negatively affect your ability to maintain and desire as well. This stuff also causes sore throats and dry mouth. The FDA should remove Benicar and Avapro from the market.,3

I still take it but seem to cough a lot and not sure if it is benicar or not.  I always cough & have some mitral valve leakage.  I do not hurt anymore very much so far but do not understand why they would have a drug for anyone to take that could damage the kidney & liver on the market.",2

"I was satisfied with this medication for a period of 6 months. My blood pressure went way down and I went off for about 2 months. At that point my blood pressure went up again and I took one pill.

I thought it was allergies. I am now 5 months w/ it every day and now it itches. Thought it was thyroid related but think the benicar is the culprit. I am allergic to sulpha so maybe that is a factor. It was great till now.",5

"I've been taking 20 MG for about 9 months.  My BP is normal now.  Experienced dizziness for the first few weeks but it went away.  Used Lisinopril before this and it lowered the BP, but gave me a cough.  Benicar does not.  Benicar is more expensive.",5

In March 2007 my reading was 120/74. Recently I had a reading of 132/86. Overall I feel fine, no side effects. I feel it is working well.

This drug made me extremely nauseous.  Could not stay on it. Quit after 2 days,4

If your doctor doesn't listen to you, then keep stressing to him/her what ALL of the symptoms are.  If you're not telling them EVERYTHING then they can not accurately diagnose a disease or condition.  If you can't remember then keep a symptom journal of what happened a certain day, and if you feel like being extremely accurate, put in times like when you took your medication(s) then any symptoms/side effects later on.  If you give a generalization of ""an hour"" or ""two hours"" when it was only 40 minutes, it would make a difference in the diagnosis.  The patient probably said too long of a time had passed for the doctor (who is really really smart and knows a LOT about medicine) to have connected the two.  If a more accurate time had been given, then there's no doubt in my mind that the doctor would have connected the side effects and the pill.  Why do people think they're so much smarter than their doctors when a doctor doesn't know what you're feeling and is relying on repsonses from you to make a decision about the probablility of a condition.  DOCTORS ARE SMART, BUT THEY ARE NOT PSYCHICS!",5
"The daily dosage recommended by my cardiologist was extremely high (40mg) and has caused me to have severe problems such as: 1. Plunging Blood pressure readings (70/50) during only minor excertions (such as petting my dog). 2. Severe dizziness and inability to breathe). 3. Unable to stand and fainting.  The doctor denied that the medication he prescribed was the cause of my problems and gave me all kinds of tests for equilibrium and stress. They all proved negative. While he was scratching his head, I (on my own) reduced the daily benicar dosage to 5 mg and added 4 mg of cardura. This was 6 months ago and I can now do almost any task without any problems.Also my blood pressure averages 140/80. By the way, my wife has the same problems with the same doctor and drug but has only changed her doctor so far. My experience tells me that the drug can be effective if the dose is kept very low.

Induced an alergic reaction. I broke out in hives.,3
"Effective, no side effects, affordable",5
"I am, overall, a healthy person. In two different occasions due to some toxins and Steroid shot combined with stress, my blood pressure went to the roof (220/120). Doctors prescribed various medications and none could lower the blood pressure to my normal values (~125/80). This medication (Benicar/HCT) brought it down within a day. That was about a year ago. Since then, I started with a pill a day (40/12.5) and within few months reduced it to 1/3 of a pill daily. My average blood pressure has remained 116/73, based on 3 readings each day. This medication works very well with no side effects.",5
"used this for a year or two.  worked at lowering my blood pressure from the 155/100 range to the 120/80 range.  however...it cause immediate pain/bloated/burning in my stomach so much i hated taking it n wanted to get off of it, which i did at a later time changing prescriptions.  i would not recommend or take again di to side effects from taking it!",5
"I was prescribe Benicar HCT 20-12.5 for H.blood pressure and my BP have been 120 or lower/by around 70 I'm 62 years old and very active this medication works grate,the only side effect that I notice is My weight went down from 174 to 163. my guess is that my body flushes by going to the bathroom often....I'm very satisfy with this medication.",5
"I take Benicar 40 HTC. It works great for me! However, since the summer is now here, I have been out in the sun. Now I am covered in bumps and rashes through out my body, especially my arms and legs. Anyone else have this problem? ",4
"I experienced weakness when I first started taking it, especially lightheadedness when getting up too fats from a crouching position. My doctor cut the medication in half, and I have had no problems since then. I have been taking it with no side effects for approx. 9 months. My BP is under control.",5
"I have been taking this medication for about 6years, works ok...downside, frequent urination, if in sun for a while,takes several months for tan to go away, eyesight has gotten worse with each year. Now wearing  prescription glasses after taking for 2nd yr. Weight gain and hard to get rid of. ",4

i am taking this medicine since last fifteen days. I have developed dry cough which is very annoying.,1
"Good, not great med.  it does it's job but does have chronic side effects, ie frequent urination for a few hours after taking each day due to the HCT compound.  Some hair loss, mild but annoying.  ",5
"After 2 mos I experienced the following: ringing of ears, rash, weight gain, eye issues. After stopping use 24 hours I started urinating again, eye symptoms stopped, itching stopped. ",1
It lowered by blood pressure but it caused diarrhea and a mild nausea. A lot of urinating I was starting to feel dehydrated. ,5
Blood pressure has been exceptionally stable without side effects.,5
"Benicar caused the fewest side effects compared to several other hypertension ARB meds. No coughing!!! Libido, while nowadays mostly dormant, is not completely dead unlike other meds where libido was zero.",5
"after just 3 pills, developed extreme head pressure and headache. So much head pain I discontinued w/o doctor's ok.",1
has my blood pressure under control,4
I just started taking this medication a for a week. Starting having loose stools.,3
"After starting Benicar I developed chronic cough, lack of energy and muscle cramps. It did lower my BP but the side affects are not worth it. I no longer take it.",5
"I have taken this medication for 18 years & on onset I slept a full 24hrs & as I continued, gradually sleep became normal. I find that my vitality is down, once every six to eight week period I have nightly excrutiating leg cramps, which cease by not taking the meds a few days, some dizziness (not often),dry mouth, but I continue taking meds for the pro out weighs the cons. I am 76 & I take no other meds! P/b readings are normal (on medication) but when dose is cut it gradually goes up again! weight fluctuates & intermittent problems with sleep!",4
no side affects,5
suffering from severe leg cramping,1
Smells and tastes like puke! I burp the taste for sometime afterward.,4
"Going on 3 months of Benicar HCT after 3 months of Benicar AND Bistolic.  Lowered my BP to about 130/80 for the most part but now trending back to 140-150 on top.  Lots of chest tightness, light-headedness and just feeling not well.  For many it works great, not sure how this will turn out in my case.  I'll update if it makes sense.  Oh yeah VERY expensive.  54 yrs old.",3
Not totally satiesfied.,2
"This is the third medication I have used to lower my b.p. and thank goodness it seems to be doing a good job.  The first week was rough due to bad leg cramps, but by the second week they were gone.  Prior to this med my b.p. averaged 150/106. (and for the 24hours I tried to quit smoking 174/106) Now I am 124/80.",5
"Been on Benicar HCT 40/25 for years. Script  dosage was doubled about 8 years ago. Feeling fine, BP 120/76 or lower. My toes have been numb and the numbness seems to change but doesn't really cause me any trouble and they look normal just a little tingle/numbness but unsure whether it is the meds. Might be from what I have read here from others. Due to cost and no insurance for the time being I am going to try Losartan HCTZ 100/25. Benicar is VERY expensive even with insurance.",5
"Before Benicar no other drugs worked and my blood pressure was 180 over 120 and Doctor said I was ready to have a stroke. After being on Benicar for over a year now, my blood pressure is 120 over 72 with no side effects. ",5
too expensive,4
"I have been on and off of Benicar Hct for 7 years. It was working very well after trying all the ""cheaper"" options, with little or no side effects, However, lately I've been having panic attacks as well as feeling ""not all there"", ""foggy"", concentration that comes and goes. Not sure if it""s a build up of Benicar or menopause kicking in! ",5
precaution with this medicine,2
I have been very fortunate and have not had any adverse side effects.  I exercise twice a week which helps with maintaining my pressure.  My average bp is 120/75.  I take in the morning due to the frequent urination.,5
"dizziness,depression,halucinations",2
I've been on benicar/hct 20mg/12.5 for about 8yrs with no side effects and had readings of 120/78.On 2/7/13 my health ins. decides they will no longer pay for meds. I've tried 2 other BP meds they asked me to try with bad results.I will not go into details but this included an E.R. visit. I am now back on benicar meds since 3/19/13 with good numbers again of 120/78 but with terrible side effects this time. I am in a foggy state and have had dizzy spells along with wierd sensations (pressure - hard to explain) on the top and back of my head. I will continue with meds but I am very concerned. What I am hoping for is my body to adjust to the meds again with no side effects like in the past. These issues have disrupted my personal life and have effected my job performance.,5
"I'm 33y/o, 5'7"", 150# male, blood chem all perfect but diagnosed with hypertension (genetics) since I was 28y/o. I exercise atleast 4 times a week (light weights lifting and playing basketball, sometimes biking and tennis).  Have taken Losartan and Losartan HCTZ that I have outgrown, my body got immuned to them I think.  Then I was prescribed w/ Benicar HCT 40mg/25mg.  On the 4th day taking this benicar, while playing basketball, I experienced leg cramping like I had when I first started on Losartan HCTZ.  I checked my BP that night, had a lowest reading of 101/52. I felt some mild lightheadedness but felt OK overall.  But on the 6th day of taking this Benicar, I experienced a very severe cramping while playing basketball which started from my thighs up to my torso!  Driven home by a friend, cramps continued at home and in dire agony I asked my wife to take me to the hospital.  In the ER I was given intravenous rehydration and after 4hrs was released.  I know very well and I had muscle cramps before but that time it was so severe that really frightened the hell out of me, I could not breathe because almost my whole body except from the neck up were cramping alternately.  I am kind of pain tolerant but it was so severe cramping and pain that I have never experienced before.  It was like a very bad nightmare that still frightens me up to now (happened 4days ago while writing this review), I thought I was already having ""rigor mortis"" while still alive =), also that experience kinda changed something in me I could not explain or maybe I just have not yet fully recovered from what happened. I guess for active persons, be very extra careful while taking this Benicar HCT.  I just started taking Azor and hoping this med will work out good on me.",2
"too frequent urination, fainting, legs ND FEET BURNING AND PAIN WHEN WALKING, upset stomach and dizziness. My Doctor says I have to take it.",4
"53 years old. Very heathy until recenet hernia surgury.  Dr. perscribed as my first bp med even though that is not what the manufacturer suggest, she took no blood, did not tests at all.  Side effects are awful - joint and muscle pain, constant itchy scalp, neck pain what I thought was a pinched nerve and it is severe.  Have now for the first time ever developed bleeding hemmoroids. Unusual bleeding is a side effect- only knew that through my own research.   Went back to the dr. - all she did was want to schedule surgery?  Need to get off this drug it is awful, time for a new Doctor and I am making every attempt to lower my bp with diet, exercise and healthy eating.",4
causes insomnia,4
"I have been on this medication for approximately 7 years.  It has reduced my blood pressure effectively, however I did gain weight and began losing my hair, as well as having my cholesterol go very high.  Recently however, I began having diarrhea, loss of appetitive, and nausea.  After 5 weeks I ended up in the emergency room severely dehydrated along with low potassium, low blood pressure, and renal failure. After recovering for about 10 days my BP went up so I took 1 dose of Benicar 20 HCT and within an hour began violently vomiting and had diarrhea for about 6 hours.  The same thing happened 2 weeks later after my BP spiked again.  I have no doubt that I developed an intolerance to this medication, since I am not on any other medications.  ",3
"I have been taking this medication for almost 10 years.  Three years ago, I started exercising. I thought, the exercise plus the use of benicar might help reduce or somewhat-cure my hypertension problem.  It did not, and I consulted my doctor and started taking half the prescribed dose.  The hypertension was under control even I have been taken half the doseage.  I am not sure if it was due to exercise or due to the medicine.  I will keep checkng my blood pressure, and check back later.",2
"After switching from lisinopril which cause me to nearly lose a lung coughing, I started on Benicar. Fow a couple weeks I was thrilled. Kept my BP perfect. Then the cough started along with constant runny nose. But the cough progressed to so hard you gag and see stars. I had to quit for that reason. BP was fine but the cough was killing me.",5
Had to discontinue as my insurance would not cover the cost,5
I believe its causing hair loss ....and a constant itch/tingling of scalp,4
"It worked great for me. Keept BP down. It is a top tier on my insurance.  Dry cough. Swelling legs, final straw was when I started loosing my hair. Been off it for 6 months now hair is back.",5
Recently have become dehydrated although I drink ample amounts of water daily. Pulse is still high and now i'm concerned about long term use effects.,4
I have been using this drug for 5 years and now my insurance refuses to pay for it and it is so expensive that I cannot afford it anymore.,5
Been on it for two years.  Only problems are price and can't be out in the sun for ling periods of time.,5
"itworks for me,as of now but who knows for the future.",4
"blood pressure was 188/92 was put on Benicar HCT. I am experiencing severe numbness in the my face, tingling in my ears,eyelids,nose,lips,feet cramping and ringing in the ears. Your posted comments have enlightened very much.  Will see Dr. to change med. I thought I had some unknown disease",5
Becoming increasingly forgetful and disoriented.,3
ringing in the ears one of the draw backs,2
"I had spiking episodes during work, then I retired. I have severe arm pain, so I researched my statin, Crestor, and now Benicar HCT.  During my research I find that either of these could be the culprit.  I take prempro and paxil. I got a shot of cortisone in my arms 21 days ago, no pain anywhere.  I will re-integrate the meds slowly to see which is the culprit.  I think no meds is better than the side effects...My bp is not too high now that I retired. 140/80!",5
Worked great on lowering BP but side effects after 6 months became to much.  Shortness of breathe was the final straw,4
"This drug works!! Unfortunately, it is expensive without insurance $130+, excessive sweating and urination (HCT/waterpill side of the drug), and impotence. Well, when my time comes, I will be sweating like a mule and eating Viagra like tic tacs, but my blood pressure will be fantastic.",5
"This medication has worked for me very well, however since it doesnt come in a genaric, my health insurance will not cover it. Andd to make matters worse, the other medicine given in stead of ,doesnt work, 147/97. are they wanting me to have a stroke? What can be done?",5
"THIS IS ONE DRUG THAT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET.WITHIN 3 DAYS OF STARTING IT I WAS IN THE ER WITH SEVERE VOMITING ,ITCHING LEG CRAMPS.EVEN MY EYELIDS WERE ITCHING.MY ENTIRE BODY WAS RED WITH ITCHING.I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE THINKING OF TAKING THIS MED TO ASK FOR ANOTHER DRUG.",1
Low blood presure,4
"Cost, I'm retired and can not afford this, is there any option to take another drug or combination of drugs that might work as well?",4
My blood pressure is just were it should be thanks to Benicar HCT. I have had a few mild side effects they are ringing in my ears this comes and goes. I feel tired but not all the time. My muscles are sore in the morning this goes away after I've been up and moving for an hour or so. All in all I'm happy with this Med. ,5
"SEVERE VOMITING,CRAMPS,DIARRHEA,DIZZINESS(PASSED OUT TWICE)LOSS OF APPETITE,CHILLS,JOINT PAIN,SWEATING,SORE THROAT ",1
My blood pressure is doing o.k. while taking this medicine but I have noticed that I have had a cough since taking it. A dry hacking cough that aggravates me esp. at night. Someone asked me if I take blood pressure med. They said that can cause a cough.,5
"I have been taking Benicar HCT for approximately 8 years and it has controlled my blood pressure adequately.  However, I have began noticing ringing in my ears that is constantly getting worse and I do have leg cramps at night.  I didn't realize that it could be the drug until I read some of the comments that are posted on this site.  I am also, like many of you commenting, a prisoner of insurance companies who are too busy trying to dictate to the doctors what drugs they should prescribe instead of trying to help their policy-holders afford their drugs.  I have been put on generic Hyzaar - 100/12.5 mg and will try this because of my insurance not paying for my Benicar HCT and to see if the ringing in my ears will cease.  I appreciate all the comments.",5
"works on HBP, but I have terrible dry cough, sweats, itching rash and feel very tired. I hate the terrible cough",4
why am I taking this drug,1
seems to raise my blood sugar level,3
Benicar has worked very well to lower my HBP and keep it at a safe level. I feel good on this drug and I don't swell in my hands and feet. My Dr recently changed my med to Losartan and I'm noticing alot of side effects. Reason for change is that I no longer have medical insurance so I really can't afford Benicar but Losartan is also very costly and I don't feel well with it. I would like to go back to benicar.,4
The top number of my blood pressure was running in the 200's.  With Benicar it is now 141 over 72.  I have gotten rid of the bad headaches that go with high blood pressure.  The only concern I have is the side effects for a mature woman past child bearing age.,5
Best HBP drug I've used so far.,5
"SEVERE ITCHING, REDNESS ALL OVER EVEN MY EYELIDS ITCHED.",4
can medication cause  bad smelling urine,5
"Just started taking Benicar HCL. Each day I took it, I felt worse & worse. 1st came the dizziness, a feeling of just plain ill health & suddenly a sharp pain under my ribs. Took Rolaids thinking indigestion--but no, by morning, the pain was worse, my mouth started watering & and I was throwing up! I'd never advise anyone to take this med. I'm not a puker, really takes a lot to puke, nothing different in diet except this med! Went off it, took an entire day of feeling lousey (18 hrs) b-4 felt better",1
Started taking this medication in Sept.'10. I worked great to lower my BP but it went down to 97/64 which was way to low for me. I felt very tired on this med. and also developed a severe rash on my back. I flet like i needed a nap in the AM and in the PM. This may work for you but beware of the itch and tired feeling.,2
"Was on Avilide and it worked wonderful, no side effects at all. They stop production on it so went on Benicar HCT 4 days ago. Take at night before bed. Next morning have been having tightness in chest and stomach problems. Going to get doctor to prescribe something else. Do not like this as I also have acid reflux and leg problems.",4
"Have tried several drugs for hypertension this one has provided the best and most consistent effect in lowering blood pressure. I am very sensitive to medications and side effects and I have had no problems with feeling excessively tired, fatigued nor depressed with this.",5
"It lower my BP very well, however, I started some side effects, I thought it was the Benicar HCT but was actually the diuretic that contained sulfa.  I had taken it for years and only had minor side effects.",4
This medication was very effective in controlling my blood pressure. I was changed to Diovan HCT because of my insurance.,5
"When I first started taking this everything was fine. I was taking Cozzar and Hydroclorizde.  I thought it would be great taking one pill. Now I feeling weak, light headed, after 3 months and I feel restless. At times my blood pressure drops really low. I stopped taking and started taking the hydroclorized and hoping my doctor will put me back on cozzar. My pharmist thought it weird my doctor put on this after losing 24lbs. I just have to say be very careful taking this. I think more studies need to be done on this drug.",2
Taking Bystolic and Benicar HCT and am extremely weak and have lack of motivation.   Was active and motivated before starting this regimen.  BP not yet a normal level.  Doctor not too sympathetic.  I am frightened and upset with how I feel. ,3

"I have been on this medication for two months.   It worked fine at first, but I am now experiencing the spikes I had previously.",4
"Have deveoped a persistant dry cough that is very annoying and yes, even hurtful.  Will be looking for other alternative drug to solve my high blood pressure problem. Simply isn't worth the MISERABLE COUGH!  ",5
"The meds worked for me but there were too many side effects that worsened the longer I stayed on it. Was on for a few years but felt like I was going to die and had to go off it. I was having joint/muscle pain, restless leg syndrome, weakness, hair loss. ",4
I have had a presistant cough since I started taking it about a year ago.  One doctor just recently told me he thought it could be my Benicar.,5
"I have been on this drug for approx 3 years, recently had to double my dose.  I have noticed a sharp drop in my Blood Pressure",4
"I have been on Benicar HTC for approximately 3 weeks.  My bp has lowered, but headaches, muscle aches (shoulders, neck, arms) at least 4 days a week.  I will talk to my Dr., because it hard living with this much pain.  It's good for bp but hard on the muscular system.",3
Started with 20/12.5 and then went to 40/12.5 works well more energy not to mention love the 5lbs it has taken off me! After reading about all the people with muscle aches I am wondering if that is my problem too. I wake in the morning and its very hard to get up. kinda scared to try anything else because I have been through quite a few with worst side affects some that took me to to the ER.,5
"Started Benicar 40/12.5 10/07.  Started noticing muscle aches, legs and fingers swelling immediately, put it off as being overweight.  Then had dizziness, ringing in the ears, eye blurriness, tired all the time and last spring my hair started falling out, doctor thought it was stress.  Also, blood pressure dropped to 90/60, too low for me to function.  This summer my liver labs were very elevated and I was diagnosed with diabetes.  Quit taking it 8/16/10, my blood sugars are averaging 30 points lower and my liver enzymes are dropping.  Less than a month off of it and feeling normal again, my husband is enjoying the lack of side effects all the way around.",3

I am experiencing spikes in Blood Pressure while taking Benicar and being in direct sunlight. What is the reason?,4
"I had tried several meds before this one that wouldn't control my BP, one week after taking this my BP was controled",4
Seems to keep my pressure in tack. Only drawback is it's effect on my bladder...now I am getting up once during the night to void my bladder.,4
"One week after taking this medicine, my skin, yes my skin on my legs & thighs hurts to the touch, they feel raw. The skin looks fine no bruise marks. I have other side effects but this is the worst. ",4

"My doctor decided to change my medication to  Benicar HCT 20/25 DEC 2009. By the end of FEB 2010 I started noticing joint/muscle pain in my arms and legs. I was sleeping alot even when I should be awake during the day. At work it was hard to keep from nodding at times. Very strange, for me,  when I had a full nights rest. I felt tired all the time. My arms hurt to raise them and were weak. Edema in my hands, legs and feet. I was not on any other medication. I was very concerned. I got in to see my doctor but not until April 2010. He changed the medication to Triamterene HCTZ 37.25 last week. So far I notice my joints are still hurting but not all the weakness as before. The edema is going away. I am alert again thank goodness! Thanks for letting me share this if it can help someone else.  ",1
"no side effects, little costly, but works",5
"Keeps my BP at 117/70 but very sleepy all day long.  Had a case of psoriasis for the first time in my life at age 70 but could be from my other drug, but doctor said only rarely does it have this side effect. Have leg cramps and joint stiffness with this drug, but it beats coughing my brains out from lisinopril that I took for 8 yrs, then I changed doctors.",5
It does a very good job with my blood pressure but after reading the comments on here it could be causing me some weakness and shortness of breath  but its great for my blood presure,5
"I have been taking Benicar HCT for about a year.  I was on the plain Benicar which didn't work as well.  Only side effects which I didn't think too much about until reading other reviews is VERY dry skin, dry mouth at night and a cough.  It is pretty expensive, especially when you have to gget it every month.      ",5

"Slight dry cough, occasional dizziness, weakness and palpitations",5

I had tried 7 other drugs prior to this one,and they only lowered my pressure just a little. I suggest walking a lot to keep up your energy when using this drug.",5
"I am a very fit, healthy person outside of my essential hypertension. Benicar HCT has controlled my blood pressure very well, but I don't like the side effects - severe joint pains, especially knees, racing heart and shortness of breath while exercising.",5
Only problem I am encountering is my copay for a 90 day supply. I do mail order thru my health insurance company and it is the one medication (of many) that I take that I think is expensive.,4
Don't take this medication if you are sexually active male. This medication is not for sexually active adults. This medication can cause erection problems and lack of interest in sex. I never had erection issues before but this medication made matter worst. I read all the reviews on webmd and I am thankful to people who posted their experience with this drug. I am sharing my experience as well..,1
I have taken this medication for over two years and no serious side effects,5
"I had been taking this medication for 2 ½ years. 40/25 HCT. It lowered my pressure from 170/110 to 140/90 but never any lower (better within few hours after medication was taken and going up after few hours). On top of it I had constantly going off kidney stones (2-3 times a month), difficulties urinating (slow and painful), short breathing, periods of constipation. Had to stop talking. ",2
 I take Benicar HCT.  Had a bad cold (sinus & chest congestion). So I used nasal spray & took Musinex. I was transported to the ER < 2 hrs later after a bad seizure. Never had seizure or anything close before.  I also take Metformin (mild Type II).,5
I have been on this med for a couple weeks. I noticed redness and dryness around my nose. Its winter so i did not give it much thought. The next day i had a rash on my jaw and down my throat. One eye looked alittle swollen. By morning both eyes are severely swollen with the rash on face and throat. This is listed as a rare and severe side effect.

"Tried so many other bp meds, been on 25 hct 12.5 for 8 years, however ringing in ears has become deafening,dry mouth at night,dry areas on face,without the hct it doesnt work as well controlling bp. It's the best so far, although expensive.",5
"After approx 1 yr developed abnormal lab readings, muscle cramps, loose bowels and heartburn. All symptoms started improving after 1 week off medicine.",3
I am been very satisfied with this medicine.,5
blood pressure went down 10 points,4
Great Medication. I have been on it for over 5 yrs with no side effects. BP runs about 114/78 all the time. Just received a letter from BCBS that it will no longer covered. I can't afford it w/o insurance paying for it so I will have to find an alternative.,5
"I've been taking Benicar Hct for about 5 years. During this time I haven't had any real issues with this drug, other than a constant need to urinate. I usually take it at night. I rather get up during the night to urinate than try to find a restroom all day long. In any event, I believe the drug worked well for me in the past.  It did lower my blood pressure nicely. However, recently I've been experiencing ringing in my ears. My doctors were unable to determine what is causing it. I'm not totally sure it's the Benicar. But I did note that other users have stated that they too have experienced ringing in the ears, since they've started this drug.  I do plan on stopping use for awhile to see if the ringing goes away. If it does, I will leave another comment regarding my experiences with Benicar.",5
"HAVE TRIED LISINOPRIL, CARTIA, TOPROL, WATER PILLS, ALL WITH SIDE EFFECTS.  WITH LISINOPRIL, I HAD A SIGNFICANT COUGH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE MY PHYSICIAN TOOK ME OFF IT.

Tachycardia if you drink one beer.,3
"Since I just started taking this medication today at 5pm central standard time Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg.  My rating for its effectiveness and satisfaction is not accurate because I have not used it long enough to give a accurate rating.  Since it is only once a day, that makes its use an ease.  I can tell you that all through this month I have had blurry vision but it suddenly began to clear up a bit after just one hour after I took it.  So hopefully this is a good sign of even better things to come.  I will report on its use daily around this time for the next week.  Hopefully, I will stay side effect free but, I will report my personal experience with Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5 as the days go by.  See you all tomorrow.",3
"This has been very effective for control of BP when combined with Hytrin by my doctor. However thank you for the reviews I had been very concerned about the almost over powering fatigue. I was afraid I had developed narcolepsy, I fall asleep extemely easy ,even when driving . Thanks again !!",4

It better then being very high like it used to be. I praise this medication, it sure works for me and I get little to no side effects. Not even enough to bother me to take notice.",5
overall seen to work no serious side effect,4
"Never had to take ANY meds before this. Doc said ""try it"" (March 2009). Lowered BP but with the cost fatigue,blurred vision,heavy eyelids,general overall aches.  EXPERIENCED EXCRUCIATING FULL LEG CRAMPING!!  Relatively certain this med contributed to, or caused lumbar spinal nerve and disc complications I experienced near paralysis to lower extremities for past 4 1/2 months including right foot drop, the side on which I experienced the most severe cramps. Stopped taking Benicar HCT 20/5 after 45 days. Doc said ""no way"" med had any link with my subsequent physical condition. Have slowly recovered with aid of physical therapy. Believe my body flushing this med out of my system as I am regaining functions.  ",3
"taking med for about 3 years, always tired,dizzy sometimes,coughing and sore throat take lonzeges.I have cut the pill in half and above symtoms have subsided a little.",4
It lowers my blood pressure but makes me very tired.,4
Controls blood pressure but have problems with potasium too low,5
"The only thing I am worried about this medication is that I am diabetic with an A1c of 6.5, and I am afraid that it may damage my Diabetes more. Other than that, I think is a very good medication.",3
"I have been taking this med for over four years and pleased with the results BUT--- THE SIDE EFFECTS MAKE ME WANT TO STAY IN BED AND NOT THINK ABOUY GETTING UP. VERY TIRED,HOT SWEATY AND NAUSEOUS. PLAN ON ASKING DR. TO SWITCH MEDS BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS.",5

DOCTOR TRIED MANY MEDS IN DIFF COMBOS; ON 3 AT ONE TIME. READ UP ON DIFF TYPES OF DRUGS-ACE INHIBS CAUSE COUGHING IN WOMEN (GOT MOM OFF 1-NO MORE COUGH). CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS AND BETA BLOCKERS CAUSED MORE SIDE EFFECTS (NUMBNESS, TINGLING, COLD FEELING HANDS/FEET). ANGIOTENSION RECEPTOR BLOCKER (ARB) BENICAR WORKED BEST-WANT TO DROP WATER PILL OFF COMBO. BP STAYS AROUND 120/70. ONLY SIDE EFFECT IS HIPS HURT (THEN LEGS) WHEN WALKING ANY DISTANCE. HOPE TO DROP ENOUGH WEIGHT TO GO OFF ALL BP MEDS.",5
"I'm on Benecar 40/12.5 for approximate 2 mos. I initially had dizziness when I was first put on the drug then went away by drinking plenty of liquids. I do experience some fatigue at times but, BP is under control. Averaging about 115/76. The highest was 160/101. I believe I also help lower it by changing my diet and increasing exercise. I current take the med every other day.",5
I am a 70 year old working male and I'm in good physical health other than hypertension.  I have been on this medication for several years and the one side effect has been a constant dry cough.  I take an antihistimine called Chlorpheniramine (4mg) to prevent the coughing.  I think Benicar also reduced my desire for sex.,5
This is my 8th medication to try and seems have finally hit it right. Various side effects with others so far not with this one. Dr. must seek approval from ins. co. Not on their list of preferred.,5
This med has maintained by b/p with little side effects.,5
"I was dx with HTN at age 16 and have maxed out several medications.  This medication has been effected and even reversed some of the damage that was happening to my kidneys.  I don't like the all of the trips to potty, but otherwise this has been a great treatment option for me.",5
I could not be more pleased with Benicar 40 HCT after two weeks of taking this BP medicine.  My doctor initially had me on a lower but separate dose of Benicar 20mg and Thiazide 12.5mg for three weeks with BP readings still averaging above 165/85.    My doctor then switched me to Benicar 40 HCT. After two weeks my readings are in the 120/70 range with minimal side effects- some slight lightheadedness after weight lifting and bike riding.  I wish everyone luck with Benicar HCT.,4
"No problems with med. I take at night, because it makes me sleepy, which is great,because I'm also an insomanic.",5
i realy don't know if it's helping,3
"Recently diagn w/ high BP has certainly lowered but now do not want to do anything. Very fatigued, no interest in anyting, some abdomin pain. Biggest prob is absolutely NO ENERGY!!",4

Matter of fact I have missed a couple of times taking the med and felt like my heart was trying to come out my chest.  Other than lots of pissing, lack of motivation at times and slight dizzy headaches, no worries.  Very satisfield.",5
I have a persistent cough.  Is this a side effect.,5

"4 days into the drug I experienced, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, loss of balance, fatigue, headache, neck and upper back pain. I will not take this again until I check with my doctor. I don't know if this drug is the cause but I also experienced leg pain when walking that I never experienced before. It did work though, my systolic dropped from the upper 140's into the mid 80's!",4
I have tried several Blood Pressure medications and this is the only one that has worked for me.,5
"i have been taking benicar for one week and i have expericed non stop dizzyness,tired, feeling faint and rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath after excercise. I did not experience this after working out in the past. I also have numbness in my arm. i will see what happens for another week, after that i will ask my dr for another medicine to treat my hypertention",2
"I am experiancing significan dryness on the sides of my face.  Also experianced a painful sore inside my nostrils and inner ear.  Anyone else experiancing this.  Otherwise, the drug is working well for me.",4
"Immediately after starting Benicar, I had Dizzy spells while getting up from a chair.  A month afer starting on Benicar, I started feeling nauseous and tired with some blurred vision.  After my two month checkup, my Creatinine levels were at dangerous levels.  I was going into Kidney failure!  This is a strong drug.  Be cautious using it and sensitinve to the side effects.  ",1
This medication caused extreme dizziness/lightheadedness.,3
leg pain,4
"I have been using benicar hct 40/12.5 for about 3 months with very good results.  My bp went from 150/110 down to 110/80. At this time, I haven't had any adverse side effects and it seems to be working.",4
feeling sick to my stomach since taking Benicar,4
"Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I can’t ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I don’t think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then…  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++",5
It seem to be working for me.,4
"My doctor has me on this drug and decided a few months ago that I should double my pills...I did and was to go in for an angy and stents in my legs...they had to cancel because of a bacterial infection..meanwhile my blood test showed my kidney function was messed up, my potassium was high and my magnesium was low.they now are going to do the surgery tomorrow..but again my kidney function is good, my magnesium is low and my potassium is high..the nurse said to stop this drug because it contains potassium in it or something that will make the potassium go up..and my kidneys are acting up again...I had stopped it after I got out of the hospital the first time for a week and my kidney function came back normal...I feel this medicine is the culprit..doctors don't always tell you everything involved with the drugs you take, or they aren't up on the awareness..I will find out when I go back for blood test after the surgery...",3
"worked great but new prob.has come up... My husband had moderate-high HBP 200/110 once and other times about 180/99 mostly 150/90,but he was so irratable,quick to anger, depressed,tired always it was bad, so doc gave the 20/12.5 the first couple of days some dizziness when getting up, no major complaints mild nausea 1st few days. he takes it at night so no effects,no major aches but he works hard so he probably passed it off on work. It was a god send he felt great re-energised,he said his mouth dry a lil, but no big complaints. he has been on it over a year and recently he has lost libido. I only seen 1 other comm. on this.its not full on E.D. but interest has declined alot and sometimes his soldier wont stand at FULL attention any ideas from you other guys? only 1 other have this? but he has been very pleased with med. untill recently anyway. he says it still works great for him. any comments welcome.",5

Er doctor said I needed to speak to Dr. about bp med.  Also had many problems on benicar hct.  Rapid heartbeat, feet cramping , severe diarrhea, feeling like everything inside of me was going awry,and just not feeling well at all.  Saw my Dr. and a heart Dr. but couldn't find anything wrong with me. I was sure the diuretic in the benicar was dehydrating me and pulling everthing out of me. My insurance made me switch to Diovan HCT and I still had the same problems.  I suspected the diuretic in the bp med but was told it was not. For 10 months I was sick with these symptoms.  In October I told the Dr. I wanted off the diuretics.  ALL SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY. Am on diovan 80 now and doing GREAT.  Please watch the diuretics!!!!! They could be your problem.",2

I have tried several different meds and with all heart medicine the first month of taking is always the worst. I don't have insurance so I get sample packs from my Dr. I do beleive however that it is the reason I have depression problems. I am a young person so fealing the effects of being old is very diffucult for me to handle. ",5

After just one day off the benicor, I feel 1000% better, my knee pain is gone, my eyesight is better, my energy is back.

"No problems when taking the norvasc alone. Since taking this combo product I have had  muscle/joint aches and pains, weakness, very little energy, mental confusion and fogginess. I felt very old, fatigued and depressed. I lost a great job. This medication is expensive so I quit taking it. It's been 5 days without this medicine and I am starting to feel so much better. The symptoms mentioned above are resolving. I would advise anyone to consider the possible life altering consequences before taking this medication.  ",4
THE ONLY SIDE I EFFECT I HAVE IS URINATING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,5
"After trying various types of medicine, this one works for me. My average BP was 160/100, now it is 130/70. Side effects are dizzyness, but minimal. I have been on this medicine for about a month.",4
One year this month- blood pressure and cholesterol doown significantly.  No side effects.  Very satisfied.,5
i am taking this drug since may-2009. my diastolic went to normal but not my systolic.during day time/working still high as 130-145 average.no ache yet but realizing a bit of sleepiness.,3
"very good med, no problems, age 54",4
"Caduet has lower my blood pressure and cholesterol.  Feet hurt, sowllen ankles. I use this for two years. I have now stop taken it .  Dr. says my legs are sowllen along with my ankles.",5
"use to have some mornings on getting up from the bed, foggy feelings in the head and some pressure on the neck with blurring of the eyes, have used this medication about 2 weeks and most of the symptoms have gone",1
"This drug was not a good match for me.  It caused constant heartburn, extreme dizziness, and a very foggy brain.  From my research, the loss of being able to think is from the Lipitor.",2
BEEN ON FOR OVER A YEAR AM 34 YRS OLD AND HAVE HAD LEG AND ANKLE PAIN FOR THE LAST 9 MONTHS,3
Hip & leg pain when walking.,2
"Lowered my BP and Chlorestoral, no joint pain, but I do urinate 3 times as much during the day, and now wake up in the middle of night to go. Small price to pay for the benefits. ",4
"Severe swelling in the lower extremetries, pain in my joints, very sore feet, always wanting to sleep, and urinating more. Don't recommend.",1
Horrible!! Severe joint and muscle pain. Couldn't sleep due to pain.,3
Pain in lower areas. Feet mainly!!,1
I have been taking Caduet since Jan. 08. Feeling much better. My joints do not hurt yet. I do not feel tired. My only side effect is that I urinate alot more during the day and night. I'm not sure why.,4
"forgot to add that BP was actually going up, pulse in the 100's by end of week.  horrible med be careful",1
"yes easy to use swallow pill done.  Problem - calves and ankles became very painfull - increased in measurement by at least 1.5 inches and right calf by 2 inches.  Depression, burning, pain in joints, lethargic and apathetic.  Only took for one week. ",1
"This combination of Norvasc and Lipitor did a good job of controling my blood pressure..but I found that it caused me to be ""achy"" and tired. I had two other people who were taking caduet report the same effects.....I asked my doctor to replace the caduet with regular Norvasc, which he did....and the ""achy"" joints and tired feeling disappeared.",4
I am extremely tired most of the time.  I just want to sleep.,3
BLOOD PRESSURE TO NORMAL/SAFE LEVEL IN 4 WEEKS. CHOLESTEROL IN 6 WEEKS WENT FROM 246  DOWN TO 149!!  NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL 11,5
how about vitamin d intake does it effect use of caduet.,3
This drug very quickly lowered my BP and reduced my cholesterol.  I was very happily surprised and have zero side effects.  ,5
This medication works well and quickly.It also controls my BP just as well.,5
"While the medication was very effective for controlling my HBP and my cholesteril, it cause marked swelling of my lower extremities.",5
"I feel sick all the time.  I sleep all the time, have bowel problems, depression, weight gain, you name it, I have it!",4
"I have taken candesartan (originally the brand name Atacand, and now the generic) for some 14 years. It has been effective in reducing my blood pressure, and I have had no side effects. My doctor originally prescribed Diovan (valsartan) but I gained weight. She switched me to  candesartan (which I take along with amlodipine) and it's been a perfect combination for me.",5
Brilliant felt great within days but after two weeks I have leg cramps and are tired but the trade off is worth it blood pressure was 175/88 now 130/70 No more chest pains shoulder pain or neck pain  A little emotional but not sure if that is menopause  Also take synthroid and have a 6 year old ,5
"I was on the label Atacand for years and loved it.  I take 32 mg a day and am suppose to cut it in half and take it twice a day.  The pill shatters even with a pill cutter. The lethargy is terrible, looking for something else.",4
This is the only medication I have taken that doesn't give me a bad cough as a side effect.,5
"took it, felt lethargic all day. stopped taking it was back to old activities like cooking, washing up etc. BP down to 137/79 each day but started taking it again and lethargy returned and 142/70.  Am also taking thyroxine for hypothyroidism,and aspirin for blood. Have been prescribed various other BP drugs with no luck.  Fed up. ",1
"Back pain. Sore gums and teeth. Increased need to urinate at night.  Similar ED  problems,as with Atacand and Diovan. Blood pressure averaged 122/84 using 12 mg.  ",3
Creat. and potassium go really high.,2
"I was on an ace inhibitor & had nighttime cough so hard to go to sleep, was on a beta blocker and was so tired I felt fatigue all day, took this ARB and felt alert and no cough.",5
"no expereince:   Military retiree pharmacy deleted issue of Diovan for my B.P. and protenuria, mild and mandated I switch to  candesartan.     i was takign, twice daily, 160mg of Diovan now I am switched to this Cabdesartan, 16 mg.  Will see what happend when i again take my 24 urine test and constantly check b.p  shame, Diovan worked well.  even sent a letter to the D.O.D. from my Doctor, non military, and some general, M.D. dnuied as it costs to much so they switched to this. Typ[ical miitary retiree treatment. disappointed..perhaps it will work?  My concern is my proteinuria will come back and i will, again, have b.p. adjustment problems.  i have a slite heart mur mur, so he the doc says.",2
"I was prescribed this medicine 20 years ago and used the name brand Capoten . I also take Thyroid replacement meds . Thyroid Gland regulates blood pressure. In the past the pharmacy has filled with generic form Captopril by mistake so I tried it and 1st I noticed the side effects (red face and red eyes were missing, when I took it) at first I liked that, but after few days noticed my pressure was high ! Found out it was not working, so went back and got Capoten ,problem solved . Well solved until Capoten became unavailable few years ago. I had to have the dose doubled 25 mg to make the Captopril effective but did not do as good as Capoten despite what the pharmacist tells you . Have had some high pressure readings of 160/105 so dosage prescribed went up 50 mg , now 100mg a day . Most times pressure stays the same after taking it , and at the most it will bring it down 10 points . Possible that i've become resistant to it or need additional meds . Captopril is the active ingredient in Capoten but my personal experience is why I don't like Captopril . I like the low cost but would gladly pay the 60 bucks for the name brand based on what i've seen . Everybody is differant but wanted to share my experience .           ",2
"Ive been on captopril for 6 months along with nadolol for for blood pressure and migraines I was on diovan before but made me gain to much weight 45 lbs,after i started taking captopril I lost weight like crazy a pound a day,now I can eat anything I want and dont gain anything,something in the pill works on the fat cell receptors ,androgen2 is what the chemical is that causes the fat cells not to duplicate.so just for that Ill take this nmed but not everyone has the results I do.so I take captopril and nadolol,and im happy :)",3
excessive coughing,3
it helped me to control my HBP better than other medication.,4
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,3
"Started Captopril 11/10/09. BP was 169/104. Today 12/01/09, BP 158/82 I didn' make many changes in my diet although I am more conscience of my sodium intake.And the only formal exercise I has was walking a 1/2 mile on treadmill this morning. I weigh 320lbs and Doc said if I lose 10-20 lbs there may be no need for meds! Sooo I'm walking them out of my life and back to health! ",4
"i use 50g,can i increase it?",3
"I took this med post partum seven years ago and it worked well. now bp high again and this med is not doing anything. i took it because of the low side effect, but it's simply not working.",2
my daughter has taken this since she was 2 and it has worked very well at controlling her high blood pressure.,5
I feel better when I use this drug. I am regularly suffering from high blood pressure.,4
worked quickly in reduceing my blood pressure.,5
In the begining this drug made me very ill and then leveled out for about a year slowly my bp started creeping up again. I am becoming unsatisfied with it's effectivness.,3
bad,1
I undergone taking this before for 3 months straight and on the 4th month half a tablet. Until the doctor told me to stop taking it.,4
damm i feel good...,5
"The medicine was great for lowering my pressure; however the chest pain I get from it sent me to the hospital several times. I had to stop using the medicine. My chest was tight and heavy. The feeling is a very uncomfortable one. I also have face numbness on my left second whenever I take this medicine. IÃ¢Â?Â?m sure it works for others, but for me, the side effects are enough to say no. ",5
"took for 30 days.  blood pressure is perfect but side effects getting worse and had to stop taking it.  i would run out of breath and have pain in whole upper chest area like asmha but the worst was the first half of the day i could not kneel down and stand up , i would almost pass out.also slight diariaha /   would not rec this drug ever",3
"Dr.switched me onto Chlorthalidone 25Mg after having trouble with metabolism and and loosing weight being on Metoprlol 50MG,which is Known to interfere with that as well as raise A1C. I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews.Right away my blood pressure went up and my heartrate increased with it pounding in my chest contantly. after the 4th day I woke up with a terrible headache, the cold sweats, was shacky and felt as though I was going to pass out. I switched back to the other medication but am going to start on Atenelol which doesn't have as many adverse side effects as Metoprlol.This was one of the worst medications I have ever taken. Heed the reviews! ",1
"In conjunction with Atenolol, this medication definitely made a huge difference. After just two days my whole body seemed to just shrink. The swelling in my feet and ankles disappeared so much to the extent that my shoes are a little loose!The pressure I felt in my chest is gone...It's now been maybe 3 months and am very happy with it.",5
Only taken 2 pills in 2 days 25mg and my calves are tightening and stiff.  I've had s previous knee injury and my knees hurt..keep getting spasms.not sure I want to stay on it. I go back to docs in 3 weeks. I'll keep taking til appt unless legs worsen..,1
"When Urinating, it sometimes burns. Feels like it has a high acid burn. ",4
"Second diuretic tried after Triamterene, still no cigar. This one amplified the heck out of my knee arthritis, and made my calves sore and stiff. Next!",2
"I have been on this drug for 10 days.  It immediately lowered my blood pressure.  I have had zero side effects.   I’m prescribed just 12.5 milligrams and am thinking 25 would keep my blood pressure at a little more acceptable numbers, but the doc makes that decision ",4
So nauseous all day. Hate this feeling. Quit it yesterday. Didn't have a problem with the direretic that I am aware of. I am just sick all day.  Yes you lose weight you don't feel like eating.  Some diahrrea too. ,1
"Was taking Losartin/hydrochlorothiazide (100/25) before, but BP was still 150/90. I started losing weight (by eating less!) and dropped 25 pounds. Also, Dr. switched me to chlorthalidone 25mg and kept me on Losartin 100mg. For first 2 weeks, was really dehydrated, had night foot and leg cramps, light-headedness, generalized weakness, strong-smelling urine, constipation, and dehydration that was pretty severe. Would have passed out while shopping, but found a chair just in time. BP dropped to 100/50. Now I take 12.5 mg chlorthalidone and 100 mg Losartin or 25 mg chlorthalidone and 50 mg Losartin (Dr. said doesn't matter which) and feel much better. BP same. BTW, water is NOT ENOUGH to rehydrate. You need electrolyte replacement. I found recipe for homemade Gatorade online and drink two glasses every day (secret ingredient = coconut water). This medication really works, unlike hydrocholorothyazide, and that's why I stuck with it through the tough part. Good luck - I hope it works for you, too. And don't underestimate weight loss as a solution - it's the best medicine of all and it's free!",5
My GP changed me from Bystolic to Chlorthalidone 50 mg.x2 a day. After 5 days I felt very lethargic and had to deal with erectile dysfunction. My cardiologist put me back on Bystolic 10 mg. Back to normal!,3
"I was unaware that this medication can cause severe sunburn. I use sun screen with a 40-50 SPF whenever I am in the sun and still I burned really bad. The skin on my face was very, very red and the tissue on my cheeks was swollen and painful. I peeled for 2 weeks. Since I am very active outside I stopped the med and called my physician.",3
I am having bad leg cramps at night since being on this drug for 6 days.,3
"This drug has helpeed me tremedously. I have severe osteoarthritis and T2diabetes. If I don't take this pill, I will add 5-10lbs of fluid weight. I have used this now for two years and it has helped me more than anything else. ",5
"I feel weak and tired all the time. I have only had 3 doses. I urinate more often, very thirsty, Sweat a lot and have a upset stomach. I am definitely stopping this.",2
"Extreme light headedness, dizzy turning eyes. Feeling of going to fall",2
Been using this drug for 4 days and have had the worst headaches and nausea ever in my life. I can hardly stand light without feeling ill. I am stopping this med today!!!!,2
I feel lighheaded.,3
My Primary Care Doctor put me on this medication for my High Blood Pressure.  Been on this medication for almost 3 weeks and it hasn't reduced my blood pressure at all.  In fact my BP is higher than when I was not taking anything.  ,1
"i have been on this for 5 days. 25 mg daily. Noticeable side effects. Very tired, slight blurry vision, sore arms and legs, thirsty and frequent urination. This better lower my bp",3
"My legs and ankles started swelling while taking other medication, so my doctor switched me to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg and losartan pot 100 mg. Problem gone! I am SO happy with the results. I've been on it for a couple of years.",5
"made me very dizzy.  I could not hardly walk and made me extremely tired constantly.  I stopped this med, It only made me feel worse",1
Have experience some increase of my A1C; as well as being tired. Some palpitations and some gout. The medicine have lowered my HBP.  ,3
"Provider switched me from other HTN med. After 4 days, BP went from 112/72 to 180/100, symptoms of dizziness, fuzzy headed, upset stomach/nausea. Yikes!  Stopped this med!",1
Light headiness-been on drug for 6 mos.,4
This drug makes me feel dizzy and lightheaded most of the time.   I also feel very tired all the time.  No problem with dehydration.,4
Worked very well except the acid reflux/upset stomach was terrible when using it. Looking for another drug which does not affect stomach or cause sexual dysfunction.,5
"just started light headedness, behind right eye about 10 min than went away, came back 4hrs later I felt full body weakness I think my blood vessels where very stressed (thus internal inflamation thak you Lord for my new DR.",3
"Caused constipation as it is a ""water pill.""  Dehydration is a problem.",3
"This drug causes type II diabetes, possibly in menopausal women. I had fasting glucose levels of 85 to 90 all my life. Taking this drug caused my glucose to rise to 118 in one month. Nothing else changed (I exercise & eat right) but this drug. My cardiologist didn't believe me but was willing to experiment. He cut the dose in half, my BP is still 115/70 and my glucose is down to 90. This is a major side effect and it needs to be considered when taking this drug. Be aware and get the word out to your doctors.",3
I can't really tell if it is effective or not...sure makes you p....all day!,2
"I have lost wieght.. Im not  sure  if  its from the  med,but my throat stays  flemmy.",3
Staging review msr,3
Caused drug induced Lupus.,1
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS MED FOR 4 DAYS AND HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING MUSCLE PAIN.  I HAVE NOTICED A CONSIDERABLE DECREASE IN MY ANKLE EDEMA. YAY! I TAKE 25MG EACH DAY BUT WAS TOLD THAT I COULD TAKE IT AS I SEE THAT I NEED IT.  NO EDEMA NO PILL.  I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS QUITE A WONDERFUL LITTLE PILL BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF NOT FOR THE MUSCLE PAINS.  I WONT BE TAKING THIS EVERYDAY FOR SURE.,4
"I have taken Chlorthalidone for many years with little side effects.  Have to take potassium sometimes,as it lowers that in the body, but otherwise no problems.  It is the only medication we have found that works for me without causing asthma problems.  Each time I get a new physician, I have to beg them to use this instead of beta blockers.  They really don't want to give it.",5
"I started out a month ago with 50mg of Chorthaladone and after a week of taking it, I was having headaches and constipation. I am now taking 25mg by cutting in half and see the same BP readings that I was getting with the higher dosage. I do have to make sure that I am eating more fruits and vegetables and lately making smoothies with Kale. This keeps the constipation under control. I am losing the weight that I couldn't do before when taking other BP meds. I also noticed that the large veins in my hands are not swollen like before and I have more energy and less confusion and clarity in my thought pattern. I also believe that the higher dosage was causing heavy pressure on the bladder. I was one that was given so many other meds that all gave me side effects that weren't worth the cure and I believe caused me many of the problems that I have had. I finally went to the Cardiologists and he is the one who prescribed this one. The drug Diltiazem given by my PCP after telling him 180mg was given me palpatations, increased the dose to 300mg which after two days the palpataions were so bad that I stopped the meds and I made my own appointment with the cardiologist. One thing that I've found out, you must take responsibility for your own health which includes questioning any meds that you take and stopping them immediately if you don't feel right and if your doctor does not find a good option for you, change doctors.",4
"Initially I lost 12 pounds in a few days but then no more and I never gained the pounds back after i stopped using it. My last blood work showed increased LDL, total cholesterol, glucose and decreased kidney function which I am attributing to this drug. I have never had these problems before using this drug ",2
"My blood sugars prior to taking this drug were perfectly normal. After three months of taking it, I developed a high blood sugar (135)and Acl Hgb was 6.67. Does any doctor out there know if this is just coincidence or a cause of diabetes which my doctor says I now have.  HELP",4
"within 7 days, joint pain & sleepiness.  stopped the med and pain and sleepiness went away.  i stopped eating wheat and have lost weight and lowered blood pressure.  i H8t meds...",3
"This worked very well for me until I had severe reaction.  Eventhough it is very rare, I developed pancreatitis.  Ended up in the hospital.  Don't care how well it worked. Stopped med immediatly.",4
"Three days after starting this (25mg) my BP was a pretty high 144/90, my tongue hurt, and I kept falling asleep if I sat still. By 7-10 days the symptoms resolved themselves and my bp is now 122/64. Noticing no associated constipation, no dry mouth for me at over three weeks of use.",5
after taking it for a few days I passed out in public and was taken to the hospital. The cause was dehydration. This prompted me to look up the other side affects which are too numerous to list. I've decided to stop taking it and just drink MORE WATER.,1
"I took this med for about six years, then a new doctor changed it and I had to take something to relieve the asthmatic attacks the new one caused.  Eventually I was taking more of each and finally threw them all out for a few years.  Kept my BP under control with diet for a few years, then it started to rise again.  Docs tried me on two differnt beta blockers, which didn't work, so I begged my doctor to put me back on Chlorthalidone.  he did, and my BP has been normal for about a year.  I have to rehydrate often, with dry mouth, but it's worth it.",5
"I lost 10 pounds the first week.Have been on this for 7 weeks,lost 5 more pounds.My stomach doesn't look pregnant now,I was so bloated before.My face and eyes have un-swelled (better field of vision) and I look much younger now.I can tie my shoes without feeling like my head was going to explode and I don't have to hold my breath when I bend over anymore.I can turn my neck easier,my knees and legs don't throb and ache anymore.My circulation is so much better,no more numb and cold feet.I must eat more fruit and potassium fluids now to keep from being dehydrated/constipated.I am on 25 mg. Before starting this drug,I could feel my veins pulsing tightly,my blood pressure was 150/110.Now is around 128/85.",5
"I am very glad that my B.P is back to normal, but I went through some problems with this med.  I am on 25 mg.'s and the first week no matter how hydrated I was my mouth had sore, not tomention the painful cramps and diarreha . I called my Dr. and she told me to cut in half for one week and then go back to full doasage and it worked. I no longer have the mouth sores, but I do have terrible dry mouth. I no longer have cramps, but I am now constipated. Too bad, I had a flatter belly than I have had in years, but now I am bloated, as Rosanne Rosannadana said, ""it's always something.""",5
"Just started this med a month ago.  I take half a pill (12.5 mg) a day along with Bystolic 5mg.  I have been on HB med for 5 years and have been switched to different meds a number of times. I believe this one is giving me some stomach discomfort. I am trying to get past this, but endurance for me is usually a period of time. We'll see......otherwise my HB is running 135/90.",3
Caused me to nod off (fall asleep) when I sat still for too long. Also caused a tingling in my right arm. Had to call my doctor.,3
Causes a fast heartbeat.  Same as HCTZ.  Always feel like I've been running like a little out of breath and my heart is beating faster then normal.,4
"if it helps me lower my pressure i'm fine with it. tryed with diet and excersize, but that didn't work",4
i have been satisfied with the results of getting rid of the excess fluid in my body however i was one that had an allergic reaction to the medication which included hives and severe itching.,4
"I've just started taking this pill last Friday. I'm having to cut it in half as it only comes in 25 and 50mg's. And was wrote for 12.5mg Plus take it 3 days aweek M-W-F. When I took it Friday, about an hour later I felt odd but didn't think to much of it. As I was driving I noticed I couldn't read the road signs till I got on top of them. They were blurred. And this was like that for 5 or 6 hours. Really strange feeling. I will give it time to work as it was only my first one. I'll just have to wait and see if it keep doing that. I hope it clears up and works for me.",2
"It has worked well for me.  When I'm traveling or I need to be in a place for an extended period of time, I find it difficult to stay on schedule.",4
seems to have side effects of blacking out,3
Prescribed this medication to help prevent another kidney stone.  Major side effect seems to be that I am now unable to achieve an erection.  Not good!  Would rather get another stone even with all the pain.,2
its makes you go to the bathroom a lot,5
I have been on a 50/25 dosage for three years. Age is 77. Blood pressure stays in the 130/90 range. After starting a  beet juice and part time vegetarian regimen six months ago my bp dropped to 110/67.  I still wake up three to four times a night to empty a full bladder. Also experience toe and ankle cramps. Both ankles are usually slightly swollen.   ,3
"I am taking 100-25 mg. I've been on this dosage for approximately a year and although it has indeed lowered my BP, I have no energy what-so-ever to do even the smallest task. It's very annoying when you have a busy schedule and a ton of things to do in a day. Some days I cannot even get up off the couch...",5
"I have been on A/C for a over 8 months and it has helped my numbers tremdously. However, the believe I am experiecing some side effects. First, I am very active in tennis and biking. I am noticing my level of energy has decreased, I had a bout with gout, my ankles get swollen and big toe joint pain. Not to mention ED as well. Is it the drug, if so, I need to ween off. I am on a weight loss mission. If I can lose 45lbs, I believe that will do it.",4
"I've been on this medicine, Altenolol-Chlorthalidone 50-25, for one month. I am also taking 100 mg of Losartan, to lower my blood pressure. Readings went from 190/100, to 98/65, which my cardiologist states is an excellent reading. When i mentioned the way i felt, he lowered my Losartan, to 50mg, to help my body adjust to the change in bp. However, I still have side effects of; feeling totally drained, dizzy..blurred vision,at times, as well as nausea,on and off. I'm happy with my new bp readings, and all of the tests I have had,are normal. Yet this seems to be making me feel worse, than I did with high blood pressure.",4
"Tooooooo much weight gain ,I'm thinking to try just for that raison a other BP med ",5
I sometime wake up with bruise on my arms and legs and dont know how i got them,5
"What's the point of treating high blood pressure when the mediation increases hunger and leaves one so exhausted that exercise is impossible? Isn't that counter productive? It also takes away any motivation to do the things that I enjoy. This should be used in place of Thorazine! I would rather have a beautiful, happy life and risk the effects of hypertention than spend the rest of my days on the couch. I don't know which is unhealthier!",5
"My first BP med caused a chronic cough after 1 month, so I switched to this.  It worked great on BP but after 2 months I had several frustrating side affects.  Dry mouth, weight gain, EXTREME dizzyness when getting up.  Sore/stiff lower back when standing up.  Stopped taking.",4
"I took this for 5 days, and was so exhausted in the afternoon I could not keep my eyes open.  I woke up the 5th night with unbelieveable painful legs, ankle, feet, and toe cramps!!!  I started with a cold sore after one day, and it countinued to spread to the entire lips and was only stopped by my taking valtrex!!",5
I instantly felt better after taking this medication. I didn't realize the excess water was affecting my blood pressure.,5
"I have been taking this medicine for 11 years and it has controlled by blood pressure. No problems in that area.... However when you take a look at the side effects, I have developed several, that I wasn't aware were caused by the medicine.  High levels or Uric Acid, which caused Gout.... for 2 years I have suffered with that.. High blood sugar and have been put on medicine for that. High cholestoral as well as.  Could not figure out was going on with me, until the endocrinologist talked to me and I expressed how dissatisfied I was with my regular doctor.  I started seeing a new doctor that told me that my medicine predisposed me for gout and other things.... I did not have any sign of these other things before I started taking this medicine.  It's been a week since I have been taken off of the chlorthalidone (diuretic) part of the medicine and swelling has gone down in my foot and less pain... Make sure you read the side effects to your medicine.  By the way, these side effects were not listed on the page from the pharmacy... (Also warning.. Who should not take this medicine...) Because my gout, diabetes and high uric acid are on that list as well.. My old doctor never changed my medicine...",5
"I get shortness of breath upon exertion. Also, a reduction of energy. I have  had increased joint pain in my knees, but, I am unsure if it's related to the drug. I do like the pressure readings while taking the drug.",4
I have been taking this for 4 months. Started having kidney and lower back pain right away. Became worst with time. Doctor put me on pain pains for the back and muscle relaxer. Stopped taking the medication a week ago and no more back or kidney pain.,2
"I've only been taking this drug for a few months, but I've began to notice hair loss.  I don't like that, what should I do.  Is there a vitamin that I can take to prevent the hair loss?",3
This medication makes me sweat profusely! My BP is sometimes good and at other times not so good. BP is very inconsistent with this medication. The water pill additive in this med also makes peeing an every hour thing! I've been on this stuff for over 10 years and do think my body is used to it already and basically rendering it ineffective.

"My husband has been taking this drug (50 Atenolol/25 Chlorthal) since his bypass surgery almost 2 years ago.  It pretty much knocks him out.  He never has any energy. - sleeps a lot, etc.  So it's been real depressing for him. He doesn't seem to have much quality of life with it...I would prefer that he not take it, but he doesn't seem to realize what it does to him.",3
"This med. works well lowering my BP and keeping fluid off, but since I started taking it I've been really tired and my hair is falling out.  Has anyone exp. these symptoms?",5
"I have taken this combo for 5 years. However, over the last year I started having joint pain in big toe, ankle and elbow. I now have gout which is due to a build up in uric acid from the Chlorthal part of the drug. My doctor switched me to just Atenolol but BP is now back up to 170/100. The gout may be permanent.",4
"My sbp was always above 150 and dbp was over 90. Tried other meds, nothing worked for long. Started this medication 10 months ago with great results. No side effects so far other than frequent urination and that's slowing down. Now bp 120/88 or lower. Started exercising and walking 3x week for added benefit, gone salt-free too. Feeling much better, lost 20 lbs so far.  ",5

"Earlier this year my blood pressure started being uncontrolled on Atenolol alone. Finally my doctor recommeded this and my pressure has been good.  Occasionally due to me forgetting to take the medicaton or not drink enough water does my pressure go up to 90 for the bottom number, but generally it is well below 90.  Now my doc recommends that I take only half a pill because it is doing a good job.  Side affects - I get tired easily when walking - which I hate, and trouble losing weight. I need help losing about 50-60 lbs but I don't know what to use.  Any ideas that will work with the meds?",4

"I have been taking of this medicine for a while and then my bloodpressure was unstable and other medication would not control it so my doctor put be back on atenolol but reduce the the dose to 1/2 three times a week and my pressue is fine if I take a whole tablet everyday my pressure drops to low and if I stop taking all together my pressure goes up to high and other medication does not control it, so i'm still taking it for now. thank you",5

"It worked great for my blood pressure, but the three main side effects were lightheaded/dizziness, tingling in my legs (like they were asleep) mostly in the upper region, and erectile dysfunction.  The ED was severe at first, then seemed to ease up.  I got off this medicine, and three weeks later the change was dramatic...as far as the ED goes.",5

"After about 6 weeks of use, developed skin allergy.  Intense itching.  Benadryl did not help.  Had to stop use of item.",3
This did absolutely nothing for my high blood pressure or my heart rate.,1
"It works very well , I had to quit taking due to insurance changes last year.  I immediately started having heart rate issues again,  Started the medication again and I have not had any issues at all since, ",4
It makes me extremely tired... ,3
Sometimes I feel like something crawling through my skin. ,4
Started with 120 mugs. now down to 60 mugs.  At first it felt like I had brain fog.  Couldn't think.  Tired all the time.  Cutting the dosage helped.  Now I'm tired half the time and thinking is more or less back to normal.  Hard to tell when symptoms last for months.  I forget was normal was like.,4
"Felt great before taking diltiazem. Then had chest pressure, increased tremors , weakness, nervous probems including adverse reaction to loud sounds, panic attacks. Dr said stop taking it. A disaster for me.",1
Fibrillation is very much improved and I'm much less anxious I'm remembering dreams which are listed as side effects in the literature and they are very pleasant.,5
"Made me itchy, achy, rash. Moody,depressed. My Dr. stopped it immediately.",1
I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia and this drug seemed to make my legs  feet and hands swell so much it was really painful. I was put on this for suspected angina but then told fibromyalgia was causing heart spasms. I'm stopping it as the Australian summer coming in makes me swell up so this on top of that would be unbearable. I have nitro dura patches and nitrolingual under tongue spray and do not have high BP so I do not think I need this hassle with swelling by this drug too. If it works for you though please use it. ,4
Currently experiencing AFib or Aflutter and speeding heart rate 120bpm,2
"After a stress test, up my dosage from 180 to 240. Have been constipated on this medication. Giving it a little more time, because I can't live with that. ",3
"I have mild tachycardia and was prescribed this after Beta blockers eventually killed erectile function after years of taking those.  Initially switch to an ACE inhibitor and the blood pressure was fine but the resting heart rate was too high, however, erectile dysfunction ceased and all worked normally again.  Was switched to this calcium channel blocker and immediately, it killed my erectile function - dead.  Got Cialis as a supplement, it still doesn't work.  Will very likely stop this medication - there has to be something better, this has killed my sex life. ",4
"Medication keeps my heart rate low and my BP low but the side effects still linger. Muscles, joints aches and cramps. Have a little pressure headache on the left side of temple. Not severe ache but you can tell its there. Like a dull ache in the head. Happens at least once or twice a day since on the medication for almost 2 months. I was off of it for a few days to try another medication and I didn't have the aches and cramps but had an allergic reaction to the other medication (NIFEDIPINE). Went back on Diltiazem because they changed the dose to 1 cap a day instead of 1 cap twice a day and they up my dose to 240mg since im taking it once a day. I was taking 180mg twice a day 24 HR extended release so the doctor was guessing that my side effects were severe because I was taking too much of it and changing it may reduce a little. My face use to flush and tingle as well when taking it twice a day but that hasn't happened since I am taking it once a day just dealing with other side effects. It works great but don't like feeling the way I do. Wondering how much longer will I deal with the side effects? ",4

"I have taken this medication, diltiazem 40 mg, for 3 years with very little side effects. On the last refill I was given pills manufactured by a different company. I have taken these new pills for only 4 days and my fibrillation has returned, I have sever dizzy spells and very odd dreams.",3
"I had pain in my leg muscles, could not walk. I already have severe acid reflux and this made it worse. I was so angry all the time I was mean and nasty to everyone. Felt terrible the whole 11 days I was on it!!! ",2
Seems to be working ok for me.  But I wish it would lower my blood pressure more.,4
Dr. Said that 120mg was the lowest there was.  I was feeling light headed . I am elderly and asked for a lower dose.  He said 120 was the lowest. He lied.,3
"Changed from Beta blocker because it simply didn't work. Took Diltiazem HCI 180 1x a day. Started in August and it helped lower my blood pressure but started noticing right knee pain with no injury to it and I felt nervous most of the time. Took med for two months knee started to swell and was having finger and toe pain that woke me up in the night. Have been off the meds for two weeks, finger and toe pain is gone but still having trouble with knee. NEVER TAKING AGAIN.",3

"I'm a female, 57yrs old, been taking diltiazem for 2yrs. I have developed hair loss and severe alopecia. Recalling these 2yrs, I have started to notice that a long the way I have been feeling, continued headaches, neck stiffness, feeling of swollen legs and hands, and for the lástima 9 months the alopecia. Went to the endocrinologist thinking it could be my thyroid, since I'm hypo, but all thyroid test came back ok. Also this doctors and other doctors, have told me the alopecia is due to stress.  I quit my Job thinking it was afecting me, even went to a psychologist, went to a dermatologist (injected me for 7 months) and I still have the alopecia  (big bald spot on the back of my scalp and on the sides), no job, no stress, whatsoever, I live a peaceful life, and I'm still at point A.  My belief? The diltiazem, I'm allergic to this damn pill or I be a low percent of the population taking this med that gets hair loss and alopecia. Has anyone Liver the same experience. For doctors It's very easy not to investigate and say It's just stress.   ",5
"Took this drug after switching from another BP med due to ED issues.  With in four days I had muscle and joint point in my right arm that was unbearable.  The pain subsided after several hours.  Continued to have pain the second day that left me with weakened right arm.  I have mild hypertension and have elected to go off meds.  I work out five days a week and am going to try to avoid medications.  This was a terrible experience and the Dr knew very little about the drug, ",3
I have experienced ringing in the ear and diariha,4

Pounding head ache every day, today first day no headache. Doc dismissed side effect, saying no other patient has reported headache. Doc stated that elevated BP is good with left ventricular block (huh?)Still on it, monitoring BP almost daily. Hate to do it but may change doc since she doesn't seem to be listening to me.",1
"Effective with few side effects.  Makes me feel tired, but take 360mgs at night.  Overall, the fatigue is manageable.",5

Severe heart pounding avoided - still pronounced ongoing thumpming,3
"The generic tablets such as Matzim and Diltiazem work well. The oblong green capsules do not work the same as the tablets. They react in a different way and wear off, as described to me by my doctor. My Dr. advised me to never use generic. However, my insurance will only cover generic.",5
"I have variant angina and a high resting pulse - no artery congestion.  This works in definitely lowers by pulse and has avoided angina attacks, especially when stressed.  However despite a careful diet i have inexorably put weight on - now about a stone (14lb in just under a year.  Also swelling of ankles and awful foot pain in hot weather (NEVER had this before), some fluid retention in hands, knees and feet, painful joints, weak muscles (carrying shopping and opening jars etc really notice it) and low grade gingivitis. Would appreciate knowing if others have found the same - maybe I need a review but at least I've been free of the angina...",4
"I have been on Diltizam for over 15 years. Have been on it for severe migraine treatments. Could not use beta blockers. Would get high B/P readings when going thru 3 or more days of migraine bouts, using this med has decreased those readings really well. It has saved my life in many respects over these years.The only really bad side effects are dry mouth, eyes and nose. And some dizziness. Lowering dosage has helped some in these side effects.",5
is this medication in generic form?K,3
My heart races. This medication works well for me. ,4
Only drug that I could take - needed secondary medication to prevent body override,3
"Used to control heart rate, I have multiple episodes of racing heart rate with skipping. I have notice fatigue, constipation. Have been taking for a week. Will update after taking for longer period. Used Atenolol previously to no affect.",3
I use it to keep heart rate low.  Since Mitral Valve replacement I have experienced several episodes of tachycardias where normal hb is 60 a minute going to 130.  I panic when this happens as the rapid hb can go for 30 minutes to 24 hrs.  Not knowing the duration is the issue.  I use it with Metropol but not a 100% fix.  I have had several ablations to fix the circuitary for rapid heart beat but every ablation seems to find a new path for the circuitary.   ,4
"I was put on this after being diagnose with Atrial Fibrillation.  Luckily, my episodes seemed to be occasional.  This drug made me feel excessively tired all the time and I could feel my heart beating in my chest.  Hope I never have to take it again.",3
this drug caused extreme rash and itching all over my body ,1
"Shortness of breath, weakness.",3
have not been able to digest capsule that has 2 pills inside.therefore have passed med in stool. so started opening cap. and taking with applesauce. Dr. OKd this I am tired all the time anxious  b/p still up,2

"I take 300mg XR (extended release). Actually, my BP is higher by ten digits in Systolic since I began taking. I do not believe this drug is effective. My systolic was about 140mmHg and now is running 150 to 155mmHg",1
Extreme fatigue.  Caused breathing problems which put me in hospital for a week last year.  Never felt good while taking it.  Quit it in April and feel really good now with no problems.  Lowered my heart rate and BP but too many side effects.  ,3

"i was given this medication for blood pressure and heart rate. i have been on it for 6 weeks and have trouble sleeping and tired all the time, and have times of dizziness. Works pretty good for heart rate and BP. I don;t like the side effects",3
"Have had problem with very rapid heart rate (hit 150bpm and skipping beats) for 20 years. Took Atenolol for 19 years,but still had occasional problems. Had some occasions of very low heart rate. Doc changed to Diltiazem about 1 year ago. Taking 120 mg once a day. Has been much better. But, had a very low heart rate (32bpm) episode yesterday that passed. See how it goes from here.",4
My hypertension has been controlled for 15 yrs with a beta blocker and HCTZ.  I need to take allergy shots which require that I not take a beta blocker.  I tried this medicine twice and both times my bp increased and my heart rate soared. I had a similar experience with a different calcium channel blocker.  ,1
"This has made me feel normal most of the time - the coronary spasms were destroying my quality of life.  The side effects of constipation and some dizziness are worth it.  The only trouble I've really had was when I started taking vitamin D this fall. I didn't know that you shouldn't - D increases your uptake of calcium, which cancels out the effect of the Cardizem.  Painful lesson learned - I'm back to normal.",5
"Afib, 18 month prescription - I've been taking 120mg-24 hour capsules for over a year now. It slowed my rather high heart rate ( 110+ resting) back down (90 Resting) and just in doing that my Afib has subsided from a daily occurance to morw like just a weekly or  every two week occurance for 5 minutes or less, rather than the 24 hour + spells I used to get. I am debating on whether to continue the med after my 18 month prescription is up. I will be discussing with my Cardiologist soon. I am tired earlier in the day and drink a lot of coffee to counteract and keep my production at peak levels through the afternoon. My energy level usually crashes when I get home from work though, which is taking a toll on my family and sex life. ",3

"Trouble sleeping, lightheaded, rash that wouldn't clear.",2
i was prescribed this after my angioplasty,4
It produced only a moderate decline in my systolic BP (around 5 mm Hg) and no change in my diastolic BP. It induced a rapid weight gain (2.0 lb/month) even with a reduced caloric intake. It also caused persistent itching in my forearms. ,2
This medication has worked great for lowering my bloodpressure without many consistent side effects like other BP meds I've taken.  ,5
"Does an excellent job controlling BP.Have side effect problems with virtually all meds. Dilt(240mg, 2x day) causes acid reflux and allergy-like sneezing. Can't find anything else w/less onerous side effects.   ",5

"Tired all the time, can't sleep, cant stay alert!",3
"Works great for keeping down my blood pressure.  I am having a couple of side effects that arent listed.  One is incontinence.  With any straining I have urine leakage.  It is horribly embarrasing.  I am also experiencing deterioration of eyesight.  The good news is that with some of the other HBP meds I had worse side effects like hair loss, fatigue and weight gain.  I dont have that with this med.  I wonder if there is some phamacologist some where that could explain this to all of us..? ",5
"I took this because I was having an elevated heart rate (side effect of an overactive thyroid).  It took a couple of days to see a difference, but it did reduce my heart rate.  Side effects: dizzy and sleepy on and off.",4

NO PROBLEM SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON THE MED.,5

"I WAS ON 65 MG'S, THEN DUE TO NO INSURANCE, I WENT ON A PLAN AT THE STORE, A 90 DAY SUPPLY @ ONLY 12.00, BUT THE MG'S WERE @ 120, MY DOCTOR SAID TO TRY IT, I AM NOW, BUT GET KINDA DIZZY & LIGHTHEADED..MAY NEED TO GO BACK TO 56.00,FOR A 90 DAY SUPPLY.. BUMMER",4
"I've was on for 3 days while in hospital. Gives abdominal pain, migraines, nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness. Off med for few days until pcp puts me back on it even after complaints about side effects. Very wicked med. Controlled & slowed down racing heart, But, side effects were as bad if not worse. Be very careful with this med.",3
"Causes bad stomach pain. Did with me first dose, causes migraines, black outs, dizziness...do not like this med at all. Pcp thinks good & docs in er too. Makes me feel worse than heart.",4
"s/s: arrhythmias, tachycardia.  Unsatisfactory attempt with beta blocker 2 mos= fatigue, lowered affect, no sexual feelings, functions at a minimal.  So swithched to CA channel blocker.  Greatly improved side effects of beta blocker.  Not as effective in reducing tachy. yet tolorable.  Arrythmias okey.  So will stick with CA channel blocker.",3
I may have not been on the drug long enough yet for full effects.  ,1
"Diltiazem was prescribed to control BP & heart rate after bypass surgery.  Side effects from taking diltiazem (30 mg 3 daily) for 5 weeks are: persistent pounding ""sinus type"" headache particularly below eyes with jaw/tooth pain, sore/swollen throat (difficult to swallow), singing/popping ears, swollen lymph glands, and an increase in liver enzymes.  I wake up with few side effects but within an hour after morning dose the side effects kick in.  Diltiazem was ineffective in controlling my BP.  My cardiologist seemed surprised by the side effects but agreed to change medication to verapamil - the side effects are now worse than diltiazem.  I suspect I am either alergic or hypersensitive to the calcium channel blockers.  Be careful if you have similar symptoms - this can be mean stuff.  ",2
"Five years ago I used it for control of afib and it worked great, just made me a little sluggish.  My afib lessened and I stopped using it for five years.  Afib started up again and I started using it again.  It made me very sleepy in the afternoons, I had difficulty sleeping at night, I was having terrible dreams and after 6 weeks I found that it had made me feel somewhat depressed, I felt very flat didn't care about anything.  My sex life diminished and I experienced erectile dsyfunction the last 3 weeks (I was on it 7 weeks). I stopped taking it, two day later erectile dsyfunction was gone, my libido came back, and I felt great.  I was surprised, it was so easy to take the first time and it really helped control the afib.",4
"The biggest problem with this med is that it's hard to swallow. It floats. A low does of this med lowered my bloodpressure, helped my a-fib, eliminated my migraines, and got rid of my anxiety/anger problems. ",5
"I have been on this specific diltiazem for 2 years. once a day is great. I take it at 8 p.m., then I lay down because I get tired and dizzy but I am okay during the day. I had a hopsitalization but that was because of caffeine, no more of that. I think it might be giving me a rash on the chest, making my hair fall out (but nothing crazy) and I'm not sure if it may be doing something to my sex drive.",4
"swollen feet and ankles, weight gain, headaches, can't get shoes on even after taking lasik for the fluid retention",3
"This mediine almost killed me.  I was on too much for too long. (420) mg capsule  I stayed in the emergency room with heart racing and pulse too low to register.  Also my BP was high but pulse low.  I started losing my hair badly like chemo, according  to my hairdresser.  I had numerous stomach and digestive problems as well.  I felt terrible all the time and never slept.  I finally called the doctor and demanded to be changed to another medication.  I should have realized it was causing these problems, but was on other meds including some for arthritis so it took almost dying to know something was bad wrong.  It was way too much dosage.  My BP was not that high.  Horrible medicine!!!",1
"At the beginning of my high blood medication treatment I was given Diltiazem and it made me sick, bloated and barely able to walk up a flight of stairs.  Told my doctor and he then prescribed Cartia instead.  Cartia was doing pretty good.  No bloating, no swelling no nothing.  Went to get a refill one month to discover they changed my pill to another manufacturer.  This one is a blue and white capsule which is 240mg.  This is right back to where I first began with swelling, water retention and not lowering my blood pressure.  Finally went to the Doctor who gave me Lasix to help me rid my body of extra fluid.  Meanwhile, I already take 25mg of HCTZ per day along with Cozaar.  Stopped taking Diltaliazem and blood pressure is lower with less water retention.  This medication causes water retention which sometimes won't lower the blood pressure.  Not good for me.  Cartia Manufacturer says that the brand name is not available right now.  Not taking Dilt anymore.",2

"I've been taking this drug for about 6 months to help with an irregular heartbeat issue.  It has definitly helped...not totally, but I would say about 85% of the problem has been corrected.  I'm taking the 120MG capsules.  I haven't noticed any significant side effects.  I was worried that I would be tired all the time but that hasn't really been the case.  This is a smaller dosage than a lot of others so maybe that is the reason.",4
I've been on 360mg a day for three years now - I've put on weight and am tired even after a full night's sleep. Good to know I'm not the only one with the same side affects  ,5

Gave funny feeling inside the chest like someone putting fingers on heart and weight gain. Has not reduced blood presure one bit or heart rate for that matter.,1
My doctor recently took me off this medication.  While taking this medication my blood sugar levels were out of control.

I have used this drug to control my atrial fibrilation since December 2007 and I am happy to report that it may have saved my life.,5
"Works very well to control blood pressure, however, for me, it also lowers my pulse greatly.  I wore a 24 hour heart monitor which showed my pulse as low as 41 bpm while sleeping.  Daytime pulse rarely over 80 bpm unless exercising.  Occasional lightheadedness.  But overall works better at controlling blood pressure than other drugs I've tried .",5

I was told that I could not take this medication because of my naturally slow heartbeat (49-59 bpm) I have high blood pressure which spikes and falls throughout the day. May have to go back to plain old hydrochlorthyizide (spelling?) tablets. ,1
"I am satisfied with the effectiveness of this medication.  However, I have experienced some coughing and arthritis-like pain in my arms and legs. I will discuss these side effects with my primary care doctor.  I was previously taking another medication which caused me to expereince severe palpitations, and that is why my doctor switched me to Diltiazem ER, 240 mg.",5

I have terrible leg cramps. Night times are the worst wake up crying and screaming from the pain. Felt weak all the time. Switched to plain valsartan and now have swollen legs and numbness and tingling.,3
"Thanks to all for the reviews.  They are an eye-opener and confirm my suspicions about Diovan.  After many years at 160-25 my new doctor upped the dosage to 320-25 about two months ago.  I now realize this drug has caused the terrible fatigue, muscle weakness, and throat swelling that I have recently experienced.  I am beginning to wonder, too, if some of the problems I had for years while on the lower dose could be attributed to this drug.  These included low level fatigue, low energy, and ED.  I stopped taking this drug today and will be starting Esselstyn's diet, as it purports to help with hypertension and related issues.  It was recommended to me years ago.  I wish I had heeded good advice then.",3

I take Valsartan HCT 160/25 for high BP. My major concern with it is urination---sometimes I get up 5 times a night. My blood pressure stays in the range of 135-160 on the upper end and between 67-80 on the lower end at a given time of the day. My uncle was a Physician---he would say as long as you BP is in the range of 100 + your age on the high side---it is okay.,5
"My spouse took Valsartan medicine with diovan and developed a chronic cough that is unbearable. The allergy doctor caught it and he is now off it. I think they said the cough could last for about 4 wks. He also gained weight around his middle, got pains in his legs, has trouble getting up and out of bed. Besides all that his sciatic pains came back from the chronic cough.",2
"I have been on Diovan HCT for around 15 years, and in the last 18 months or so, I have had severe hair loss.  I was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) when I had my physical last year, but my nurse practitioner denied that it could be caused by the Diovan.  I am going to discontinue it and hope that I can lower my BP with diet and exercise.  I also hope that my hair and platelet count improve.  ",4
"I have recently had blood tests and am found to be extremely low on Vitamin D. This can be a side effect of any ""thiazide"" medication. Please monitor Vitamin D levels while on this medicine. ",5

"I am hypothyroid since childhood, have a terrible time controlling weight, but have done well in spite.  About 8 months ago Dr. put me on diovan and my weight exploded and I can't keep it down.  Am working with Dr. to find another Rx.",3
"Caused a very long period of disabling fatigue and mental confusion from the HCTZ. Doctors did not associate the side effects. I had Lupus for which this drug is contraindicated. Lupus had not been diagnosed, but I still feel the doctors should have figured this out. ",3
"When I first developed high blood pressure, I was put on Diovan 80 mg and then shortly after that 160 mg. I had great control of my blood pressure for years.  Then after about 4 years my blood pressure started increasing again. So my physician started me on Diovan/Hydrochlorothiazide 160/25--this worked  for me without any obvious side effects.  After a few years my kidney function decreased very slightly which is a known side effect, so my physician decreased the hydrochlorothiazide to 12.5 mg.  In general I like this medication very much.  It controls my blood pressure, and I don't have any obvious side effects.  The kidney effects are known and the prescribing information says that small decreases in kidney function are not reasons to stop the medication.  I'm sure it happens with most people on a chronic diuretic.",4
"I have been on Diovan HCT for over 10 years. I started on 160mgHCT but it was increased to 320HCT. I did have trouble with my have breaking, it doesn't seen to be breaking anymore.It seen as though every since this medicine was increased I have had trouble sleeping.",4
"this medication may be making  my hair fall out. is anyone else experiencing this, Please let  me know. Ive  become very depressed over this and the male doctors don't understand how important that is for women.",3
"I have been taking Diovan for many years now. It has really helped, along with diet, getting my blood pressure to an acceptable level. The doctor is pleased with the results. As for side effects: I do experience dizziness sometimes when I stand up quickly. So, I have learned to rise slowly and that (usually) keeps the dizziness at bay. It does cause me to have more bowel movements than I had before, and that is annoying but nothing that alters my life. Finally, I have noticed it does not mix well with alcohol at all, at least for me. And I am not talking binge drinking or excessive drinking. Even one or two drinks usually gives me a headache, and I did not have that prior to going on Diovan. It would be nice to enjoy a glass of wine or a beer a few times a week, but I am happy with my blood pressure readings so the sacrifice is worth it to me. ",5
Have been on this drug for the past 5 years and has regulated my blood pressure to near perfect.No complaints.,5
Be careful of taking 320 mg it may drop your pressure too low.,5
"I began taking Lisinopril (generic Diovan) about 10 years ago.  After complaining of coughing up blood, I was switched to the name brand Diovan.  Took Diovan for about 6 years and gained 60+ pounds.  Had a hard time breathing, let alone exercising due to the weight gain and swelling.  I also suffered two torn Achilles tendons.   I am also on  Synthroid for lack of a thyroid.    Curious, I tried an experiment:  what is my blood pressure WITHOUT Diovan?  Guess what...no difference.    Useless, expensive med that did me more harm than good.  ",1

"Has anyone developed an itchy rash while taking this medication?  I have taken Diovn HCT 320/25 for the past 3 years, and have a severe rash on my back, hands, elbows and have developed puffy eyelids.

Started out at 160/25 level but was dropped to 160/12.5 as I experienced some dizzy spells.  Medicine worked well for about 4 years but then diastolic number went up to 90+.  Doc added Bystolic to the mix and that has helped my BP.  If I am hot, I sweat like a shower head thanks to this medicine but am happy with the medicine otherwise.  ",3

CAN'T be shaky). After 3 days my husband forbid me to take any more. Been off for 11 days & starting to feel like myself again.BE CAREFUL WITH THIS DRUG!

However I am having severe finger nail problems and I am looking for input from anyone who has also experienced this while taking Diovan Hct. I think my hair has thinned as well.  I do have more back pain and see that as a side affect too. All in all less side affects than with other BP meds, I just need to determine if it is causing my nail delamination.   ",4

I have started exercising regularing, controling my diet and trying to lose some weight. My weight has not gone down, but seems to be going up despite all my best efforts. My husband recently experienced similiar reactions to other medications that he was taking - again, later discovered that the meds were causing the problem. I thought maybe this is my problem. I stumbbled across many of the same feelings and side effects.. I will be making an immediate appointment with the Dr. and getting off this stuff.. I often wonder why the drug manufacturers think that we will simply miss the ill effects in hopes for a greater benefit.  I never thought this would be me..

Only issue is you have to drink enough fluids to keep from dehydrating. Yes, a few dizzy spells once in a while but all blood pressure meds come have that side effect. Just have to get use to them.

This seems to come and go every couple of months.

I was attributing them to me beginning menopause until today when someone suggested it was the HCT so I looked it up and again am floored...I've been exercising and trying to lose weight and couldn't figure out why I was losing inches and not weight.  WOW...am making an appt with my Dr. to get off this stuff....WOW...thanks for the heads up folks..",5

"I have been taking this drug for 5 years and it works relatively well as far as regulating BP. However, my insurance co. will no longer cover the cost of the prescription, which CVS wants to charge $144 per month for. In an attempt to find out if there is a generic or replacement drug, i stumbled across some user reviews. The side effects reported by other users have truly shed light on the problems that may have been exacerbated by this drug. #1 Severe muscle cramping! When I asked my DR 4 yrs ago if it could be this, he simply gaffed it off as me being a big fat pig who complains about aching muscles. #2 Severe sinus congestion that has been ruled out as any typical allergy by the ENT who thinks I am NUTS because I can get no relief. #3 Severe stomach pains and frequent bathroom visits, especially at the on-set. After 4 days of no MEDS - because the DR is stalling and won't write a replacement prescription, I have no cramps, I can breathe, and I am not popping pepto or gaviscon every few hours. Apart from the fact that my hands and feet are swollen and I have a headache, I feel pretty good. There are so many problems with this situation: #1 My doctor is obviously not too bothered by the fact that I may have a stroke - I should find somebody new. #2 This pill should not cost $4 a day - it's not made of gold and isn't experimental ar magic. #3 My insurance company blows. #4 The FDA needs to do more for patients. Why does it take a google search to help me find that many of my complaints and aches and pains could have been remedied 5 years ago? Yes, I am fat, but despite what my (also fat) doctor thinks, fat is not the root of my problems. A crappy physician is who doesn't care about me is.",4

For those of you who have weight gain and hair loss, please keep in mind that hair loss is common among men AND women over fifty, and it is impossible to gain weight on a drug that is calorie-free.

Wondering if there is any help for me to continue using this drug or if there are samples out there that I may get.

Feel better, stopped most meds already hope to kick most of the rest soon.",2
"After reading, nice to know alot of other people have side effects.  I have many of them and am checking with my doctor.  There is a generic for Diovan HCT called Valzaar-H. I get 90 Diovan HCT 160/12.5 for $113 from Global Pharmacy Canada 866-850-6021. I spend $313 for 90 days for all my RX's, which normally cost $ 777.  I know, I've had no insurance or job for over two years.  My doctor approved buying them there and has the name and number for her other patients.  Thanks for all the input from all of you.   ",4
I think that my hair is thinning because of this drug. I'm a 67 yr. white female and I have been on this drug along with Janeuvia (a diabetic drug). Could the hair thining be a result of Diovan alone or the combination of the two drugs?,5
"BP on the rise after initially on Atenolol 25 mg, was put on Diovan also rather than increase the Atenolol dosage. I attribute the BP increase to the use of a NASID called Meloxicam (Mobic).Anyway, this wasn't working as well as the Dr. wanted, so he put me on Diovan HCT. It has worked some, but not as well as needed (still get borderline numbers even with the meds). Besides not working well, the downside: extreme weight gain, fatigue. Also, after initially increasing urine output - which I believe it's supposed to do, output now seems lower than before I started taking it. Diminished libido but didn't kill it. Oh - and the cost is absurd! I'm becoming very skeptical...    ",2
"Diovan hct 320/25 has worked to lower my blood pressure but dr. added atenolol and aspirin to get desired results.  I have been complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a lot of weight gain around my midsection. Have had a hysterectomy and a thyroidectomy. I can't seem to find a solution to my problems. dr's send me from one to another to find the cause. Am really frustrated!",4

"Tried three other meds before starting DiovanHCT and none of them had any effect.  DiovanHCT dropped my BP 35-40 points.  The only problem I've experienced has been an increase in my heart rate when I started an exercise program and began having low BP problems while sleeping.  My doc lowered the dose and heart rate went back to normal.  I'm still exercising and hope to be off all meds in the next few years.  My insurance company doesn't like it, so it is 'top tier' expense for me but worth it.",5
"I have three people in my life who have taken this drug and had severe reactions to it. All three ended up in the hospital with severe vomiting, and other abdominal issues. All three were fainting, dizzy, and had alot of the other symptons as well. Low sodium, yellowing skin and eyes, skin issues, sinusitus. Extreme low sodium and whacked out potassium levels. The list goes on. Only after being taken off this med were they better. This has to be the worst medication I have been a witness too. These patients were father, husband, and very close friend. I do not suggest this med to anyone.",3

"aCCORDING TO MY DOCTOR,  MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS BETTER.",5
"I know a lot of people have had problems with this medicine just like I had when I first started taking it. I learned a few tricks when taking Diovan. First you MUST drink plenty of water or juice. Cranberry juice, flavored water, vitamin water, poweraide or gatorade really helps. And it also helps to take potassuim. And limit the amount of salt/salty food consumed. These are things that really helped my muscle cramps and fatigue. ",4
"I am experiencing rapid hair loss. Is this a side-effect from taking this medication.  I started taking it April 2010, and my hair is falling out by the hand fulls.  Does Diovan HCT 320/25mg. daily do this?",4
"After reading all the problems others have had, I have to say I have it all and am furious I am on this drug at all.  Huge weight gain! Intense muscle and bone pains, can barely walk anymore nor sleep; and now dangerously bad low platelet count. I am hoping I can convince the dr. to get me off of this immediately!",4

"Been on HCT for several years (3+ yrs)1st mth had headaches but went away. Did notice weight gain in the mid-section, hair loss and cough but did not contibute to drug until reading these comments. However, within the last yr I've experienced severe muscle cramps & joint pain (so severe I felt like my shins were breaking in half) and I wear out really quickly and frequent urination. Come to find out drug lowered my potassium levels so now I'm taking a potassium supplement along with the HCT which seems to help a little with the cramping but not take them completely away. Just walking around the grocery store still wears me out.  Also, have been experiencing lower back pain and not being able to sleep at night and extremely tired during the day probably due to lack of sleep at night. Anxiety attacks(feels like I'm on speed) and can be very moody.  Went to DR yesterday & explained problems and she says that my dosage maybe to high therefore lowered my dosage. Right now I'm taking 2 - 160/25 a day so I'm going to try lowering to 2 - 160-12.5 a day. Hopefully that will help with the side effects and if not, I'm defintely trying something else. This weight gain in the mid section is killing me. :) All in all the drug is very good at lowering the BP and if you can deal with the side effects or don't have any at all it's a good BP med to be on. I've tried several different kinds and this is the only one that has actually worked at lowering my BP. Now I'm happy to say my BP runs around 126/80 which is a great for me. All I can say is, try it for a few months and if the side effects are so severe and you can't deal with them, then try something else.  ",5

I have been taking Diovan Hct 80 mg for a while and it is marvelous. The only side effect i have noticed is my appetite has decreased which is okay and frequent urination. It is expensive even with insurance a month's worth is about $70.00. ,4

"Has worked over all. Its good to see some of the symtoms I'm having are the same from reading a lot of the other reviews, like headaches, hair thinning etc. It sure would be nice to handle this issue using natural herbs, because I'm sick of drugs and there side effects which may cause some other issue's in your body. I have got to find a way.",5
"Has worked well for my blood presure, however I am concerned with certain side effects I have heard about, need to check into these.",5
lowered my blood pressure quickly and helped maintain at a normal level,4
Like other reviewers using Diovan- I have the occassional leg cramps and tickling in my face and hands sometimes as prior to taking this medicine my hair was really thick. Now my hair is thinning and the texture of my hair has severly changed and I'm at my wits in with this medicine.,4
"Have been on this medication for years. Had my tonsils out due to chronic sinus, weight gain, pain in feet, flatulance,hair thinning.

Can anyone help?",3
"I had to dicontinue this medication after one year because of severe side effects like dizziness,numbness in different body parts and my back.I am not relieved yet from the side effects od this medicine and now I am advised to see Neurologist for further treatment.I also called the Novartis but didn't get any satisfactory answer.Now I am going to report to FDA about thr severe side effects.",3

Diovan with HCT works great for me.  I had very high blood presure 160/118  and it lowered it significantly in a few weeks.  After 9 months my presure is 120/78.  Unfortunately very pricy w/o insurance.,5
This drug was to decrease the hand tremors. For awhile it was slightly effective. I'm up to 160 mg with very little results. The only side effect is it causeas you to be lethargic.,2

My hair is half as thick as it was a year ago. Started so slowly I didn't really notice. My Dr said it wasn't the drug. I researched and found that it is a side effect. I am still losing hair, I wonder if it will ever stop now. If your hair starts thinning, don't wait to see how bad it will get, change meds. If BP meds cause hair loss in YOU... always ask the pharmacy if it is a side effect before you fill your next RX.",3

I still have a above normal reading-150/80- on rising in the morning. By 4.00pm the diastolic can go as low as 55. By 9.00pm the reading is as low as 117/66. I cannot quite understand why the BP varies as much as it does.,3
has worked for high blood presure,4
I have been on this medication for more years than I can remember and am now thinking some of the problems I have had are side effects of the drug example--- weight gain - hair loss - diarrhea and the worst muscle cramps one could experience!!!! even the muscles in my neck so from the top of my body to my feet!! If I cut back on it the muscle cramps seem to be lessened but that means raised b p so I am asking my new Dr to think of changing to another medication. I want to thank everyone who reviewed this drug -- It made me aware that some of the things I am experiencing are most likely form this drug.,5
"I have been taking Diovan HCT 160/12.5 for about the last 12 years after discovering I had Type II Diabetes. The doctor seemed to think this was the best BP medication for diabetics. I have blamed my problems with shortness of breath, additional weight gain, joint pain, and severe fatigue on the fact that I am very much overweight. Now I wonder if this drug may be the culprit as well.  I have gotten to the point where normal daily chores are overwhelming and do not sleep well even though I have removed all caffeine out of my diet for the last two months.  I applaud the fact that these reviews are available to help us out.",4

I gained alot of weight and lost alot of hair ( use thymuskin gold gel) it helps alot. But now I'm going off of it, since my b/p is lowered and the side effects seem to be outweighing the good. I'm greatful it did the job, but now I have to concentrate on my ever-expanding frame, and I can't do that while on an rx that caused weight gain. Good luck to everyone out there.

The first time I took this pill , i became very lightheaded and dizzy I was overwhelmed with sweat. My blood pressure was 160/90 and that quick my bp dropped to 90/60 it snowed me. My body could not take the quick change. So therefore i am tired of being a lab rat with bp meds, i am going to go to a specialist a cardiologist for now on.

I have also gained weight around the middle, experienced hair loss, has frequent diarrea, dizziness, fatigue, back pain, kidney pain.  Since I am on more than one medication I cannot one hundred percent blame everything on dioval/160mg/12.5 hct, but a lot of the problems some of the others described apply to me also.  I will ask my doctor about some of them.  He put me on diovan to help protect my kidneys since I am a diabetic.  My legs also hurt terribly when I try to walk. They say lose weight but if medication prevents you from walking and don't mention the tiredness.  I used to exercise morning and evening but am now to tired.  I usually go to sleep after I take the meds.  All of mine seem to make me sleepy and taking more than one is too much, not to mention after taking four BP medication my blood pressure remains above normal, usually 165/78 or higher.  What's going on?  I have headaches, sometimes for a week at a time.",3
I have been on this meds for over five years now it is keeping my pressure the way it suppose to be have not had a side effect as my doctor said with every medication you have to eat have no complains with this drug.,5
"So far so good, except for the price. On my RX plan it's a tier II, I'd prefer if I could find two drugs that would work that are both generic.",5
I have taken 360mg of Diovan for 6 years.  Two years ago I stated taking it with 12.5 mg of HCT.  I soon developed diabetes.  I have been off the drug for 5 days and my diabetes has disappeared no matter what I eat.  What is going on?  Has this contributed to or caused my diabetes.  I feel so much better since quitting it. ,4
"Been taking a month. Have dizziness, GREAT PAIN in calves and low back when I walk. Very dry mouth and back of the neck pain. I just read all the commets on this site about Diovan to see if I was alone, not. PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS TELL YOUR DOCTOR, IF SHE/HE DOES NOT LISTEN CHANGE DR. I had side effects from Lisinopril, that I complained about for a long time, my MD said not possible, WRONG !! I almost died. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY !!! Don't let them make you think that YOU are nuts, YOU ARE NOT !!!! YOU feel what YOU feel.",2
"I have been taking this med for 4 years and believe it has caused me severe hair loss. As a female, this is very depressing.  I believe is has caused me to gain a lot of weight around the mid section. I am a vain person so I would advise no one to stop their medication because of this. I am thinking of asking my doctor to change my med.  ",4
I reveiwed this drug 2 weeks ago. I have been off of it 2-3 weeks and my shortness of breath is very improved and my abdominal pain is gone. I do have a worsening of my dry cough at night with my new meds but am sooo glad to be off of diovan,3
It has been working fine. but now i notice that my blood pressure is now  118/78 to 120/79 should i be worried?,5
don't like the renal effect believe maybe causing pain in left side just under rib cage together with that I also believe it may  cause  my skin sensitivity causing me to do a lot of scatching( don't know if any of these efects are related to diovan drug),4
saw immediate lowering of blood pressure with very little side effects.....,4
"I have been taking this med for about 10 years. My blood pressure is well under control except when I get an occassional migraine related to stress. Because of my headaches I also take a BetaBlocker with my blood pressure med. Overall though, I feel Diovan HCT has kept my blood pressure pretty much under control.",5
"This drug is terrible---weakness, weight gain, tired, nausea, back and joint pain.  It should be off the market.",1
"It works, but there are alot of side effects, mainly anxiety, pounding heart and passing nausea.  Hopefully it will go away after I've been on it a while.  Did reduce blood pressure from 168/110 to 117/80 in a week's time.",5
I have been on this for 5+ years. i never felt my b/p was under good control [runs 140/85+] I didn't think I was having side effects but gradually have become very short of breath and have major weight gain in my mid section. I can no longer afford to take this so my Dr. started a generic drug. Hope the sob and weight gain go away,4
"After being on Exforge and Ramipril, I was put on Diovan after experiencing side effects with those 2 medications. Diovan was immediately effective in lowering my BP but I experienced a fast pulse and heart palpitations daily even being sedentary. I also felt sluggish, had a cough (like I did with Ramipril)and headaches. After being miserable being on Diovan HCT,my primary care physician put me on Benicar which I hope will the one.",4
My wife says she can tell when I don't take it. She says i get a little short with her and the kids. ??? I dont notice any problem. It must be them !,5
diovan hct is the only midication that has worked for me....after trying many!!!!.,5
I have taken Diovan HCT for the past five years. It overall has been efeective in controlling my BP. I have always had bouts of dizziness with this drug. The past three months I developed a cough and some stomach pain. Though effective I may need to switch.,4
started taking 320mg with 12.5mg HCT.The 25mg hct was two strong and this dosage is compatable for me.I had no futher side effects and it is a 4 dollar cost at walmart.,4
"This medication is not lowering my blood pressure where it should be, and am experiencing dizziness, sleepiness, fluid retention, heart palpitations",2
"I just started taking diovan 80/12.5- 2 times a day. I've only taken it for 2 days and developed burning ears, neck, and a bad headache, I could not sleep my 2nd night taking it although it did lower my bp from 142/82-131/76 called the Dr. and she said to stop taking it. ",2
This drug made me dizzy when i first started taking it. That has gone away. I  have been on it for 5 yrs.  it does give you dry mouth but that is becasue there is a diarectic in it. You need to drink lots of water and yes that will make you go to the bathroom more.  My blood pressure stays at 110/65.  ,5
"I have been taking for one year after trying many generics that had too many major side effects.  This one did for several months then all went away, but now I started a slight cough occasionally throughout a day or night, but doctor says not a side effect, but I disagree after reading many comments and the last paragraph of the instructions that mention cough.  I will stay on until I see him in April.  Does anyone know if the natural product sold by GNC and other health stores known as the seven flowers actually works.  Diovan HCT 180/25 has lowered my Bp to 120/75, but I won't accept any side effect as this tells me it is not natural for a medication to cause other problems.  ",4
noside effects noproblems ,5
"The only drawback, is that I have to urinate a lot.  ",3
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP IN CONTROLLING MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,3
"works great  but did  any Women get  any yaest infections  when they  started  taking this ,  thank you",5
"The medication worked great BUT... I developed a cough and did not realize it was a side effect for 3 months because it was a light dry cough, switched meds and the cough went away in a week.",4
"as soon  as i  started taking this  med,  i could tell the  difference  , much better , some meds i cannot take  but  this one  really helps  no problems  ",5

I HAVE BEEN ON THE MED FOR A LONG TIME  BLOOD PRESSURE IS 117 OVER 76 I FEEL GREAT,5
Started taking it for high blood presure diovan hct 320/25mg blood presure was 155/100 now runs about 118/70 to 124/80 makes me real dizzy but i can deal with it although when first started taking it i had all the side effects your body needs a month to get used to it,4
i started taking 160/25 got extreme swelling in calfs and feet. when i walked for more than 1 block ive got severe pain in kidneys and lower back. but lowered my blood pressure. but not worth it at all.,2
"It works good, the military system no longer uses this drug, but I feel they should, because the replacement is not working as good as Diovan.",5
"I've been on many different meds for high BP....most recently on Verapamil.  But even taking 240 mg, my BP was at best in the 130's (often 140's and occasionally 150's) systolic and upper 80's (and sometimes 90's) diastolic.  I've been on the Diovan HCT 160/25 for a week now.  My BP at the doctor's office today was 110/60, then 110/70!!  At home it's been running in the 120's systolic in the 70's diastolic.  With no side effects (other than a few more trips to the bathroom because of the diuretic) and the great control of my BP, I'm lovin' this drug!",5
"it lowers my BP for sure, though only with 25 of HCT in combo with 160 of diovan. Lower amounts of either stink for me.  By far the best in terms of my ability to maintain exercise tolerance, energy, etc which were probs with other BP meds  My main concern is that I have been in a prolonged depression flare-up and have to wonder if it is this med or not.",5
"I developed a chronic cough that lasted 18 months.This cough would go on for a half hour every single night and resulted in loosening the muscles in my vagina and rectum, causing fecal incontinence. I stopped taking Diovan and the horrific cough and resulting incontinence went away within 3 days. Went to many doctors however not one caught that the cough was caused by Diovan. Found out that this was a side effect on my own thru reading. Diovan did a lot of damage to my body, however I am getting better. ",4
Expensive even with insurance. easy to take. cannot be subsituted for generic,5
Used for only a month. BP has gone from 150/105 to 120/70.,5
slight dizziness - no other side effects,3
"After using this bp med I started having  problems sweating profusely, rapid heartbeat, feet cramping, severe diarrhea. I felt I was becoming dehydrated on this medication. Unfortunately Doctor did not think this med caused these problems. Was sick for nearly year.  Symptoms stopped when I asked to be taken off of this medication. Am now taking Diovan 80 mg. Also looking for another DR.",2
been on diovan hct for about 7 months and its been effective and easy to tolerate.  No noticible side effects.,5
I had to use this medication for hypertension.  I lost weight on a different medication and my blood pressure stabilized.  I was able to be off my medication for approximately 3 months before my blood pressure began to be elevated and I had to reuse the medication.  I had no hesitation to use it.  It works well.  I take it at bedtime so I don't feel dizzy after I take it.  ,4
been taking for about 4 months now and then i still feel dizzy but not to much else of any thing eles,4
"As a pilot, I was extremely satisfied with this drug.  I did experience dizziness when standing for the first two weeks.  That has gone away.  My blood pressure has gone from 160/98 to a much more acceptable level of 130/89.  Although I'd like it a little lower, considering the stresses, my poor diet, and lack of exercise do to an unusual work pattern, this medication is extremely helpful even without my help.  I do notice improved, easier, and more relaxed breathing and lowered blood pressure.  Side effects included the initial week or two of lightheadedness while standing, fatigue (not wanting to get off the couch).  Although once I began to move and get moving, I did not feel more tired than normal and I am able to complete a normal day's work without a nap.  ",4
"This medication caused a gnawing sensation in my chest and moderate to severe heart palpatations. As an MI survivor this was cause for alarm.  Also, after being on it for one week I saw my blood pressure drop at first then rise to the highest it has been in years (160/100).  My doctor put me on Diovan to try to get it down from 150/90 where it had risen to on a straight ACE inhibitor. ",1
"Shortness in breath when climbing or trying to due work at a fast pace sometimes,Problems with E.D sometimes, always need water, no dizziness",4

its been good for lowered mine to 112/78 in 9 months from 160/132,4
I've had outstanding results with this treatment.  I've been on DiovanHCT for over 2 years and my BP normally runs about 119/72.  I check my BP about twice a month and find that it never varies much from 119/72.  I take the medication each morning. It is easy to use and I am very satisfied with the results. I've not had any negative side effects.,5
I have had a fast drop aain blood pressure but I have also had alot of dizziness,4
I have severe hypertension secondary to severe hyperthyroidism. The result is that I'm living with an elevated sympathetic nervous system. I'm off the beta blocker(tenormine). My endocrinologist tried many antihypertensives to get B/p down. Diovan is the only one that worked well. However I find that If I take 320mg bid I feel wonderful and b/p is excellent. My Dr. says no way! So I'm back to 160 bid and only feeling ok. I wish I could take more but he said the side effects would be too harmful. Too bad. Any suggestions?,4
"Diovan HCT 160/12 did not reduce my blood pressure for the year & a half that I took it.  My doctor upped the dosage to 320 and 2 weeks later at my check up, my blood pressure had increased.  With this result my doctor added Norvasc a week ago and my blood pressure is still above normal.  But has come down slightly with the added Norvasc. Makes me wonder if it is doing more harm than good.  Since on this drug I've suffered with depression, hypothyroidism and just recently with a dermatologists diagnosis of discoid Lupus. This a rash that occurs whenever I'm exposed to the sun with or without a minumum of #50 protection. Is this related to the Diovan I'm taking? Who know's?  Neither my doctor or dermaologist knows.",1
"Lowered BP to much. Side effects include dizziness, chest pains.",2
"I was taking my mother=in=laws B/P. I Mdecided to take mine.  162/104. We started on low dose but progressed to 320-12.5. Since then it has varied between 136/96, as low as 112/52. No ryme or reason. ",5
"It has lowered my bp, but side effects change throughout the year I have been on.  Tried many generics and had too many side effects I could not live with.  With Diovan I experienced anxiety at first, then everything seemed okay, then I experience heaviness in my chest sometimes.  Doctor did all heart tests and all is okay including colestrol, but I want to get off of this medication that I am sure my doctor will keep me on forever.  Does anyone know of a good supplement that works????  I am on 160/12.5",3
I've experienced extremely excessive sweating ultimately resulting in colds especially during the warmer months.  Also excessive sweating when attempting any manual chores.  Am looking for another BP medicine.,5
"Started on80/12.5 dosage Have had to increase dosage to 160/12.5 no side effects Also, there is a generic version Cipia Ltd  Mfgr.  Valtan 80/160/ 320-12.5      ",3
"Never knew I had high BP until going for a FAA exam.  220/170 sent me to a cardiologist who started me on Diovan.  One dosage brought my bp down 80 points to a ""normal high BP"" which then he bumped me up to the high octane flaver 320/12.5 mg which now has been keeping my BP around 130 / 80.  No side effects whatsoever and no rhyme or reason why the excessively high BP.  Doc called it ""bad luck""",5
"I have been on diovan80mg once a day for about three months. I have had really high blood pressure for a long time that went unnoticed. I was running 186/123 for the last couple years and have tried a couple different medicines. This one seems to work the best and has brought it down to 100/65. I have forgotten to take it once or twice and I get EXTREAMLY bad headaches. I have pain in my fingers that I’ve never had before. I am only 22 and have had all the test done to see why I have high bp and nothing has come back abnormal. I'm not over weight and high bp doesn’t run in my family. In fact, everyone has low bp. I am very active and run five miles a day. Anyone have any ideas? My Dr. says some people just have high bp, but it’s very uncommon for my age.",5
I have been on Diovan HCT for 4yrs. and would say it has been very effective in treating my high blood pressure.  Normal readings most every checkup (3months) However recently have been experiencing a very EXTREME craving for salt- wonder if it has to do with my Diovan HCT usage?  Will be asking on my next visit.,5
"This medication controlls my BP but the side effects are getting worse.  I have been on this medication for about 2 + yrs. now and the pain in my joints, muscles and back have been getting extremely worse.  I can't get out of bed without limping, I am in severe pain when I walk and most of the time I want to sleep.  Before I started taking this medicine I was very active.  Even my hair is beginning to fall out more and my headaches have gotten worse.  I have had so many tests done to find the root of my problems and everything was negative.  I believe it is all a result of taking Diovan HCT.  I am going to have the doctor change it to see if the pain goes away.",4
worked immediately.three months later I'm having dizzy spells could it be diovan?,5
"Been on Diovan HCT for 2 years, increasing dosage to 320/12.5 mg. with no side effects until the past 8 months.  Side effects have since included pain in hips, legs and numbness of calves/feet when walking more than 2-3 blocks.  Mentioned to doctor that I had seen same side affects posted on web and suggested taking me off of Diovan HCT. He didn't think the medication could be the cause. I've been off of it for 1 week and hip pain gone after 24 hours.  Pain/numbness of calves and feet have improved although calves still feel tighter than normal.  Feet no longer go numb when walking.",4
"I was taking Diovan 160 BP was at 120/90.  Doctor switched me to 320/12.5 and blood pressure now regularly at 130/80.  Not sure why the increase in the systolic number, but the doctor hasn't been concerned.  Other than that the medicine has worked better than the 160 with few if any side effects.  Actually with working out and eating properly I have experienced weight loss.",4
my rx calls for 160mg/12.5 2x per day. My bp varies from 120/72 to 160/90 so it is not consistently effective. The muscle cramps in my buttocks and lower back are a concern plus a muscle contraction in one eye causes major vision problems.,3

I use it with atenenol , which I take twice daily and with just taking the atenenol alone Ihave some headaches and heaviness in my chest and with the diovan it's not as bad.  Is it something I can do without?  By itself Diovan does much of nothing.

I have rapid, then slow breathing, dizziness, light headed, stomach weight gain, larger arms...But my doctor would not reduce the meds.  I wrote him a letter explaining all of this then called him, explaining, that I was in and out of the ER because of the increased pill. I wanted and asked the doctor to Please return me to the lower dosage that I felt worked well for ME...This doctor refused and refused to refill any more pills.  When I called his office he told me to find another doctor. I am forced to break the pills half until I can find another doctor.

Also started the generic when it became available. I take it at bedtime and have not had any of the side effects mentioned in the articles on WEB MD. I'm still living here in 2016, so I'm supposing along with my MD that it's doinig a good job. I never really had high blood pressure though even previous to the heart attack. but it's been a very stable 110-120 over 80 average since.",5

In the morning ( fasting) my blood pressure was high, and 2 hours after taking this medication there is no improvement. My doctor resolved my health problem when he switched me to another generic.

If I sat too long or laid down, would experience pain in my lower back and joints. I am no longer on this pill, experienced severe allergy - swelling of my throat and nose area.  In the hospital for 2 days. Don't know what caused it, but was taken off the Diovan and put on Norvasc.  Other than that my blood pressure was low.    Unfortunately all BP pills have side affects, although I am hearing that Diovan (Valsartan) has many more.  ",4

"I take 160 mg twice a day. It took a few months to get the dosage right, but it works well, at this dosage. I also take HYDROCHLOROT 12.5mg once a day. since I matabalize medication quicker than the 12 hour time release is suppose to last, I need the Hydrochlorot mid day to avoid any high spikes from occurring before time for my next dosage. The medication seams to take a while to get blood pressure levels stabilized in my system and I have to make sure I do not miss a dosage. Before my Doctor found the right dosage and combination, my pressure would suddenly spike into the 200 and 300 range! ",4
61 yo. male. BP was between 135-150/85+ Doc ordered Diovan 80mg. I cut em in half. BP now stays under 120/70 constantly. ALL of my headaches disappeared. I study Martial Arts. NO side effects as i can see. I feel great. It just costs so much. 9 months now.,5

"Have taken this for years with no problems. It was recommended to me by a pharmacist friend after encountering issues with other blood pressure medications. Was recently switched to Valsartan (generic)and began to experience random dizzy spells. Am concerned that the timed release isn't working and noticed after research the generic manufacturer has had problems in their plant located in India.  Am going back to Diovan, it is a bit pricier but can't have random dizzy spells.",5
I have had very good results from Diovan. Now my drug company has switched me to a generic and my blood is rising again.  Have to go through all the work of finding another one that works.                                         W hat can we do about the insurance companies? Not a thing!,5
I have been on Diovan 80 mg for 15 years.  It has controlled my BP and I will continue to use it.  My biggest problem is the cost.  Is valsartin a generic equivalent?  I dont know of side effects.  I am 69 year old male and have attributed weight gain and joint pain to age related problems.,5
I have been taking several different BP medicines and none seem to keep the BP down. They work for a few days and then it goes up again. I started Diovan about 9 months ago and it seem to work. This is the only medication that keeps my BP under control with no side effects.,5

I had tried several different types of BP medication (time to time with my Doctor's recommendation to save money) with no long lasting results.  Some even made my BP higher!  Diovan is the only medication that keeps my BP under control with no side effects.,5

Update on discontinuance of Diovan 40 mg. 12.5 mg HCTZ. I first posted about fibromyalgia symptoms resolved. A new and more long term symptom is resolving also. I would describe it simply as tennis elbow in both elbows. Elbows would become sore and inflamed with use especially my right elbow (I am right handed). This was actually the first symptom to appear. I didn't make the connection until it went away after stopping the meds.,5
"have used this for 5 years and have noticed gradual and then sudden weight gain, as well as muscle spasms in toes and aches in calves. the doctor laughed at my concerns but upon my own research, I have found these to be symptoms.

"Thank God for these reviews. History, 5 bypasses twice in 1998 and 2000.  Multiple stents since then.  I have always been vert susceptible to side effects of all medications  Been on lisinipril for years and had the cough everyone knows about, it kept my BP at a consistent 95/55.  My pharmacy had filled my scrip with a different generic that didn't work well, I mentioned it to my Dr who recommended Diovan to alleviate the cough and add some benefits.  Took it for about 6 weeks and had gradually increasing  multiple symptoms I didn't even realize that were associated until reading online.  Eyes twitching, pain in feet and ankles, runny nose, suddenly very cold nose/hands/feet, weakness (that gradually got worse and worse, and more.   Then the worst part came. Instant severe tiredness and palpitations that made me feel like my heart was stopping.  My blood pressure shot up especially the diastolic (lower number).  Called the dr who wanted me to monitor my BP during episodes and keep diovan but I said screw that.  I had some of the good lisinipril left, I changed immediately.  The most intense side effects disappeared right away although they repeated on and off for days even prompting me to go to the ER.  They had NO ANSWERS which ticks me off now since I had found all of the answers here.   If you stop taking it expect the side effects to last for a lengthy period.  As I write this it has been 9 days and the effects linger although diminished.  Frankly I am feeling better in the last 20 minutes having read through this thread.  Yes, I understand anxiety can exacerbate the issue...and it had.",1

"I began taking Diovan 40mg 12.5 mg. hctz about 18 months ago. It controlled my bp well and seemed to have few side effects.  About 6 months ago I began having bouts of all over joint pain usually for short intervals. EVERY joint in my body would ache. Three weeks ago the pain became non stop and the intensity was unbearable.  I was tested for RA and Lupus, negative result.  My internist informally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and recommend a rheumatologist if pain did not improve. At my regular cardio appt. I described my symptoms to him, he immediately took me off the drug to see if it would help.  6 days after discontinuing the meds I was virtually pain free and remain so another  week later. If you are diagnosed with fibro or suffer any of these symptoms after beginning the med find a doctor who willhelp you get off this and onto something else while you determine if your symptoms improve. I was on the lowest dose, so was able to stop immediately although this may not be recommended for higher dosages.",5

"Before anyone takes this drug, they should have a blood test for their ANA level to see if they have an autoimmune disorder.  In 2006, I had NO health issues, but I went to have a mole removed.  I was nervous and had a huge amount of caffeine (coffee and soda) during the day.  So when I got to the Dr. office in the afternoon my blood pressure was really high which I have since learned was because of the caffeine.  Anyway, she put me on Diovan which was new in 2006.  Within a month I started having swelling and pain in my joints.  My knees & ankles hurt and my hands were really swollen and painful.  My daughter told me these sounded like symptoms of Lupus which my dad was diagnosed with when he died in 1993.  When I mentioned this to the doc, she ran a blood test and my ANA was sky-high so I was diagnosed with Lupus and sent to a Rheumatolgist.  Fact is that even though my ANA may have been high, I had NO symptoms of Lupus until I took the Diovan.  I believe it triggered my Lupus symtoms.  I'm no longer on Diovan but now I take Plaquenil for Lupus. The Lupus symtoms didn't subside when I quit taking the Diovan.  Sure wish I had refused the blood pressure med back in 2006.",1

My doctor asked me if I was taking fish oil (yes, 2 tabs) and she said double it.  My BP went down quite a bit.  Then I switced to 3 women's Mercola krill oil tabs per day, plus CoQ10 and 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 (have this tested) and 2 large cups of green tea per day.  BP went down from 170/90 to 120/70--perfect! As we get older, our bodies suffer more and more irreparable damage from the environment.  You need to find out what is causing your BP to go up and fix it--not gloss over and chemically medicate it.  The American Heart Association is lying on it's website when they claim ""no one knows why a person has high blood pressure."" There are tons of studies out there on natural substances and fixing your diet (no sugar, low carb)to lower your BP, the better your blood sugar is, the better your blood pressure will be, in general.  Get a meter and use it.  Keep your blood sugar in the recommendations of the meter mfgr which are the same as the American Diabetes Assn.  Good luck to you all.",4

"Overall I am happy with this drug, very little side effects in a couple years.  However, lately my body temperature is lower, almost 2 degrees and my legs and feet seems cold.  I am taking Diovan W/Hctz 160/12.5 orally.  So last week I was walking with my wife about 2 miles and half-way through the walk, my left leg got slightly num, like when you sleep on your arm and a felt fatique so my wife helped me home; anyhow this happen twice in a row on walks so I decided to make an appointment to see my doctor and couldn't get an appointment for (4) days so I decided to cut the diovan pill in half and took half and I felt better the next few days, no pain when I walk or numness.  When I told my doctor about this he examine me an ordered a circulation stress test, which I am taking on Thursday; however, he told me to start taking the pill again full strength and about an hour after taking the pill I felt cold all over and my wife took my temperature and it was 96.8 not 98.6.  So I am confused as to what is happening to me.  I feel I should only take half the medication again like when I first started out the drug with my doctor at 80 mgs.  I never have seen these symptons discuss with diovan oral tablet--what gives?  My wife says I should get a second opinion.",5

"Taken Diovan one per day for over 7 years and reduced to 3 per week 2yrs ago as I was suffering joint pain - unsure as to the cause I looked up side-effects hence my actions. January 2011 B.P raised GP said possibly due to not sleeping due to chronic cough, which I have had for over year as yet undiagnosed. I now have severe pain in my shoulders,neck,knees - feel low, weary,my osteopath thought I should get a blood test as it cold be Polymyalgia - test negative which is good but why have I all this pain? - expect a bit at aged 66 but I have always been active, eat healthily and I have a high pain threshold. Reading these comments on muscle weakness and pain so similar to mine has made me reconsider this drug and I am now reducing it and utilising natural remedies - including meditation - eventually will cease using it - I'll take my chances but at least I'll find out if the cause is the drug. Sometimes I wonder wheher these drugs make us dependent and diminish our natural capacities to address high BP",4
I have been taking Diovan for 4 years now and my doctor kept me on the medication while I was pregnant in 2007,3
"Diovan has effectively controlled my HBP, however, the addition of Savella for the treatment of fibromyalgia, has increased both BP and heart rate.

"I have been well controlled on Atacand for 15 years, but a change in my insurance company made this a pre-authorized drug and they wanted me to follow their protocol and change to a different medication.  My Dr. changed me over to Diovan 80mg once per day.  Within 2 hours started having terriable side effects.  After 3 days of treatment side effects included, choking feeling, pain in left arm and left calf, insomnea and when able to sleep, nightmares and a pounding heart.  I have been put back on Atacand and we are hoping that there is no damage just from the 3 days I was on this medication.  The cost of the Diovan and Atacand are very close.  So I guess I do not understand why it has to be a prior authorized now by my insurance, just because they have changed RX companies. People in offices are messing with my health!  And may have caused damage for a few dollars.  How much more will this cost to correct?  If able to correct! I know that Diovan works well for many people.  And I am thankful that it helps them, but if you are asked to change because of cost?  It is not worth it if you are well controlled on a different medication.... Please beware and keep in touch with your Dr. daily when starting on this medication.",1

"I have been taking Diovan 160 mg since about 1998? I had a cough that would come and go through the years but would never stay away for long. Since the very begining I had constipation and sexual disfunction. In the last year I had increased dizziness and sleep problems. The disiness part was happening as I'd try to work in my garden and stand up quickly. I'd nearly pass out. Told my Dr. about all this stuff and he said to quit taking it for a month and then we might try a different drug if the problems persist. Now only a few days after I stopped taking it my stupid cough went away, constipation quit, the dizziness stopped completely and my libido has returned!!! I'm full of power again and keep busy getting my work done and then some!!! Shocked that this was the cause!!! Incredible!!!",3

"I've been taking Diovan HCT 120/12.5 for 10 years now. Has kept Blood Pressure down. Since Menopause I have had severe heartburn/burning esophageous and bone/joint pain, also blood pressure has been irratic along with dark urine and dehydration. I have stopped this medicine for 4 days now and am concerned about problems that could arise from such long use and discontinuation of this drug. Is there any side effects on the blood vessels from stopping this medication???",4
Dizziness at times when standing quickly.,4
"I started taking Diovan in 2001 due to a persistent cought from another BP med. Stopped the drug for about a month and started taking it again and developed a fast and pounding heart rate and lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks. Felt terrible!  The pounding heart rate was the worst.  I could feel EVERY BEAT....pound, pound, pound. I was sent to a cardiologist and a work up camge back negative. I finally stopped the Diovan and the pounding, fast heart rate went away and by libido came back.  I would NEVER recommend this drug!",3
"diovan works very well but you must be careful using codiovan which can decrease your potassium levels and sodium causeing less oxygen in your blood,leading to passing out.i also advise if you change your eating habits to less salt change to regular diovan.",5

coughing,3
My blood pressure  went from 130 over 78 to anywhere from 110 over 68 to 98 over 58.  I feel it is bringing my blood pressure down much to low on the diastolic end. Is this common?  I take my pressure with a digital blood pressure monitor.,2
Fainting,3
"Before I started taking diovan 160mg, I was on lisinopril and toprol xl.  Had side effects to both of those drugs.  I have done well on the diovan.  It made me feel woozy for the first few weeks but that tapered off.  It does a great job keeping my bp low.",5
"i hv bn taking Diovan 160 mg for several yrs and find it too expensive and can,t under WHY THERE IS NO GENERIC RECOMENDED by my Doctors in USA BUT CAN ORDER gENERIC FROM cANADA???",3
IT IS A GOOD MEDICATION FOR ME. KEEPS THE SWELLING DOWN FROM MY LEGS.,4
"I have been on Diovan for 2 mos.  Even though it has lowered my blood pressure to 129/70 I have experienced severe side effects.  Gout flare ups, Leg cramps and pain, sore feet, nasal dripping and cough.  I have asked my doctor to take me off this med. No more Diovan for me.",1
Dr. recommended replcement of Vastec to reduce hypertension.  Reduction accomplished,3
The drug works very well keeping my BP under control. The only draw back is there is no Generic and it quite expensive.,5
only BP drug that I have used that didn't make me cough,4

I am 68 and have been taking Diovan for two years without any side effects.  My blood pressure averages 138/73 over a month's readings. I have had no headaches or tiredness. I still have sex four or five times a week (without viagra!)and I have a busy work and social life. I can recommend this treatment.  ,5
"I'm really not sure if this is the right treatment for me.  Everytime I visit my Dr., my blood pressure is very high.  Since I have been taking Diovan, I have noticed severe fatigue an tiredness.  I suppose this could be a possible side effect.",3
The only symptoms I get from taking Diovan is a brief headache which last only for a few seconds.,5
"This medicine makes me itch, I break out in rashes, welts. I itch from my head to toes. I have a bothersome dry cough.

I feel that this medication causes me to feel fatigued most of the day.,3
"This drug does cause tiredness.  Also I am experiencing a strange symptom, I get overheated easily with exertion. Red in the face and overheated, it takes me a few minutes to cool off.  Does anyone else have this symtom?",5
I have had no noticeable side effects and my blood pressure is always below 120/80.,4
"swollen ankles, and leg cramps at nite. have tried numerous blood pressure meds, coreg, norvasc. all give me bad leg pain and cramping at nite. having a hard time getting adjusted as i've gotten older. clonodine reduces pressure. Why some Drs. against it i don't know. I think the coreg or norvas is my problem, but Drs. keep increasing dosage.Want to decrease leg pain and cramps, don't know how.quinine used to do it, but gov. took it off market for cramping. nothing else works. need suggestions badly.",2
"I WAS PRESCRIBED THIS DRUG AFTER LISINOPRIL CAUSED COUGHING AND GAGGING.  I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 2 WEEKS AND HAVE HAD SEVERE MUSCLE SPASMS IN MY FINGERS, ARMS AND ABDOMEN.  IT IS ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE. I AM GOING TO SEE IF I CAN HAVE MY MD CHANGE TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.",3
After taking for a few days I got a terrible itching rash with raised sores. Also ankles were swollen and wrists and knees ached.  I was so tired I could hardly function.  The worse experience I have ever had with a mdication.,1
"Severe,Severe, dry mouth. At night my tongue was stuck to roof of my mouth. Caused blisters, bad. Also caused severe leg cramps.This is Poison. Insc company took me off of benicar and put me on this crap. Bad reactions. Took a month arguing with insc. co and help of Doctor to have them give me my benicar back. Same price for either. Cant figure that out. Must be kickbacks",1
"This medication has worked for me, easy to use (1 daily), overall, I am satisfied with my experience.",5

 my doctor gave me this at his office since my bp was up. the side effects of this medication is horrible.i had so much pain in my legs and body after taking  the medication that i could not sleep plus i had horrible lower back pain plus diahrhea and exhaustion so bad that i did not even have the engery to take a shower the next day after taking this medication.,2
"After a minor heart attack, doctor put me on diovan 80mg per day. Pressure went down to 122/52 and that gave me dizziness. Am now trying half dosage to see what happens. ",2
If you have muscle pain or weakness stop taking this. I was so bad I could barely walk. I also had rashes and diahrea 5-6 times a day and severe pain in my back after eating.,4
This was the 5th pill we tried and it was a relief to find one that finally worked with no side effects. ,5
IT SEEMS TO DRAG ME DOWN WITH NO ENGERY.,3
"After taking 80 mg diovan for 5 days, I experienced very low blood pressure 87/54 runny nose and some stomach discomfort. Was on Lisinopril for several years with no side affects except slight coughing.    Will return to Lisinopril.",2

"experiencing pain in rt shoulder.  only been on the drug 3 days and wondering if this is side effect,",2
"After a week on this medication, I have extreme dry mouth, nasal drip, and muscle cramps.  I already have migraines and often have verdigo so the fact that my health insurance prescription company changed my medication from one with little side effects to this one is ridiculous....not happy at all and talking to my dr. about finding a better one.",3
No side effects. ,5
The only side effect I have experienced is I seem to need to sleep more. I did have a sleeping problem so this actually helped me get good night time sleep. I do wake up slower. I had horrible time with Lisinapril causing congestion and continues cough which ended immediately after I switched to Diovan. I am happy to have found something that works for me.,4
"Have been on diovan for 2 weeks. Terrible dizziness, headaches,fatigue & BP is minimally lower. Something else has to be more effective without all the side effects. Now I understand why so many people are not compliant with BP meds.",3
i have to take norvase 5mg together with Diovan 80mg to l0wer my pressure to 120/80,5
This drug did not lower my blood pressure.  Went from 80 mg to 160 mg to 320 mg.  I experienced bad jont pains for the first two or three weeks but they went away after about a month.  When taking 320 mg felt extremely light headed and had nasal drip. This is the third bp med I have tried and the side effects were not as bad as the others but it did not lower my bp.  Will start a new drug tomorrow.,1
"I did not like this medication, I noticed I stated to get very bad gas also my BP went up and not down headaches and blured vision...NOT HAPPY",1
"I had been taking other bp medicine but with side effects of coughing etc, but Diovan does not seem to have any side effects other then that it is costly, but I could fine the Generic in India and it will be (generic) available here in two monthes or so ",4

"I had an immediate and violent reaction within 12 hours of my first dose.  I broke out into fever, chills, shakes and abdominal cramps.  The doctor should have been much more specific about the possible side effects before trying this on me.",1
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,3
"I have been very dizzy, and had extreme muscle cramps. I also have short-term memory loss. Sometimes I can't recall what happened the last five minutes.",4
trouble breathing,1
this drug seems to work for me but I find it to be very expensive. some people just cannot afford to stay on it.,4
"for about 3 mos. I have had terrible side effects after 2 yrs using.  My doctor does not think it is med, but I same reaction to Metropole after 2 yrs.  I have ringing in both ears, heart palpitations, sweats, trouble sleeping, sore feet, cough and nose drip. i hope to be off tomorrow. Hope to go holistic medecine route.   ",4
"After taking 160 mg and experiencing muscle pain, debilitating headache, constant runny nose, I halved the pill and the cramps and headache is gone.  Nose still drips but less.  My diastolic pressure is usually in the 60, at times 55.  My doctor said that is not important.  But I worry.  Isn't this too low?",4
"I have taken Diovan 80/12.5 for almost 10 years and I have kept a normal reading for the whole time I have taken it.  I suffered headaches before taking it and have been headache free for the last 10 years. As you can see, I highly recommend this medication.  ",5

"I have take diovan for approximately a year. Drug did lower blood presessure but cardiologist added norvase for control of pressure at night. After a week of norvase, I had an onset of vertigo for two weeks along with a skin rash on  hand joints.  Was so nauseated it was difficult to function.   Primary Physican said to discontinue the norvase. After  a week the vertigo was gone. The rash subsided after a week of predinsone.  Just recently I have had Another onset of skin rash and now back on predinsone with some improvement.  Wondered if anyone else has had a similiar experience.  Any suggestions for getting off the drug and controlling bp with a more natural approach.  ",4

"ALTHOUGH THIS PRODUCT HAS HELPED MY SYMPTOMS, IT MAKES ME LIGHT-HEADED AFTER SITTING OR LAYING DOWN. ",5
I have been taking 160mg daily for 3 years and have had no adverse reactions or side effects.,5
I have been taking Diovan for over two year and have not experienced any side effects.  I am African-American and have been on several medications since 1989.

I have had lower BP's while taking this medication and have been satisfied with my dose.,5
Take one a day. blood pressure normal. No side affects. ,5
"Diovan HCT caused disturbing ""psychedelic dreams."" There is an academic article on the web that studied this side-effect.  It suggests that once daily dosing may induce psychedelic dreams; and that twice daily dosing may relieve the problem.  Shame on the manufacturer for not mentioning this serious side-effect!",2
Was put on diovan 320mg because of severe allergic reaction to lisinopril almost died. I take Diovan along wit hctz 25mg and diltazem er 300mg and bp is controlled. Can't take metoprolol because it's a beta blocker and due to allergy to beestings have to use epipen which won't work with a beta blocker. i've had no side effects and medicine is better than heart attacks or strokes my dad had a bad stroke at age 52 from high bp and I saw what it did to him and I don't want the same.,5
"Could not take Lisinopril due to severe cough. My Md put me Diovan. I was  on this drug 2 months, had bloating, stomach discomfort, gas, hair fell out and depression. After weaning off this drug felt 100% better. ",4

"i switched cold turkey from lisinopril, cause i was just so tired all the time. so i went from 10mg of lisinopril to 80mg of diovan overnight. i have noticed taking this drug for 5 days now at night. that i sleep very well but i wake up super tired and for me to functin at work is a task becausee i am exhausted and usually gain a headache about 2 hours into the morning. sometimes bad that i come home and lie down. i guess iw ill give it a few weeks to work before i complain to doctor.

"My blood pressure has been the best in a long time. I am stating to get tingling in the fingers and once in the toes, ",4
slight coughing,3
Been on this for three years with no problems from this drug but the lopressor can cause extremly low B/P some days.80/54 so I have to watch how I take each pill and the time between them.,5

"Started taking this drug on 10/13/09, nothing but problems, heart racing, acid reflux really bad, gas really bad, itchy chest and leg pain.  I walk 3 miles a day and the first 15 minuntes I'm now tired. It hurts to lift my arms to apply makeup.  Doctor switched me to Exforge, I will give it a couple of days to see how I react.

I've taken it for 7  years without problems.,5
Have been taking 160mg/12.5 HCT for about 3 years.  I am sensitive to sodium and this seems to have controlled it quite well and has brought my BP from moderately high down to normal.  I feel no side effects from it.  I swim fairly strenuously daily in a 1 hour workout for the past 25 years and have noticed no joint ache since starting it.  I take it 1st thing in the morning before my swim.  I never knew there were so many dissatisfied patients.  Oh well its been working fine for me.,5

I am interested in any and all sexual side efects of diovan.,4
"When I started this medication 2.5 months ago, I felt immediate relief.  I had difficulty breathing in the night, lying down sleeping,this eased almost at once.  I had a dull pain in the chest area, this also vanished.  The only symptom that I experience, once in a way, is slight lower back pain, mostly in the night after I have been sleeping for hours.  I thought this had something to do with my kidneys.  Other than that I have no discomfort at all and lost 3 kgs during this time.  I have to confess I started walking regularly as soon as I started taking this medication.  May be that is another reason for not having any joint pain.",4
wouldlike to know some of the side effects of this drug,3
DIZZY SPELLS,2
I have been on Diovan 80 for at least 5-6 yrs now and have not noticed anything signifcant other than my bp is stable and the dr. and I are happy with my numbers.  ,5
I have been on 160 mg of Diovan for over two years with no significant side effects.  It seems that most people who have problems with a drug provide reviews and people who don't do not provide reviews.,5
"IN A HIGH STRESS JOB, AND I AM ALSO KNOWN TO HAVE WHITE COAT SYNDROME, THIS B/P MED WORKS GREAT FOR ME, HAVE REALIZED THAT B/P MED WORKS BETTER WHEN TAKEN BEFORE BED TIME,(DR'S WON'T TELL YOU THIS)ALSO THIS MED IS COMBINED W/ A FLUID PILL, I TRY TO TAKE IT AT LEAST 2HRS BEFORE BEDTIME.",5
"I've been on atenolol, metropolol, enalipril, and amlodipine but diovan was the only med to get my BP down to a reasonable level. have no side effect although I'm usually sleep deprived so I cannot attribute fatigue to the drug YET.",5
"Very happy to read these comments. I am a 49 year old male and have taken Diovan 80MG for several years. I have experienced fatigue and a blase attitude (almost depression like), no muscle pains but very concerning palpitations on occasion. 2 years past I told my doctor about this, went on cardio monitor which revealed nothing...but it still happens on occasion. Libido is reduced too. I am very fit and run 3 miles 3 times a week. ",3
"I've been on the Diovan for awhile and it is working to lower the blood pressure.  Interesting, the doctors believe it's that ""White Coat Syndrome"" that's causing my problem, as I am deathly afraid of the doctor's office, anything to do with it, ever since my mom passed away.  Plus, I had a very traumatic experience, which I believe initiated my whole fear of the doctor.  Anyway, anyone who gets put on this stuff, stay with it, the side affects eventually subside, did for me!  You want to make sure you take care of yourself, eat well, exercise, get a good night's sleep, and you'll be fine.",5
"My B/P fluxuates,is because of my diet,stress etc. My hair is thining,could that be related to Diovan.",3
"it makes me feel weak the whole day, without strenght, and my bp is always high.  so I stopped one month ago and feel great just taking veg. juices every morning",2
Some timees my blood pressure goes low,4
"Started taking approx 2 yrs ago.  Noticed arthritic symptoms soon after.  Was diagnosed with possible Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  I saw several Drs for the pain and swelling in my joints.  None of them agreed what was causing it.  This past April, I broke out in hives,had acute renal failure, severe joint pain and spent several days in the hospital, during that time was taken off of diovan.  Joint pain and hives disapeared.  Six weeks later and after starting diovan again joint pain and hives returned causing another stay in the hospital, bu tno renal failure.  This time I convinced my Dr to take  me off of diovan and try something else.  I am now taking Norvasc and for the last six weeks I have had no joint pain, no hives and kydneys are functioning fine.  The diovan was the only common element to both hospital stays.",1
"This review system does not include race, which is an issue for this drug. One very important fact about this drug is that it may not work well on African-Americans, of which I am one. So, it may not be advised that this drug be used because the natural inclination for the doctor is to 'up' to dosage when another drug might work better with a low dosage. Doctors are too quick to prescribe and then up dosages. This isn't good in the long run due to the effect that drugs have on the liver.",1
BP still goes up and down the same as before I took the drug. Have so much foot pain and uncontrolable flatulance. Has anyone experienced the same and what BP drug did you change to that was better? ,3
blood preasure is normal.,5
As long as I watch my salt intake it is very affective,5

"I took this medicine for 6 months. After 4-5month of taken this drug, I started to feel that my legs and arm get weaker and weaker, hardly to go upper/down stairs. muscle shirnk. Change amount of urine,  fatcgue, I felt these symtoms may related to Divan. I cheked it from internet,it's rare side effect,called Serious breakdown of muscle (known medically as rhabdomyolysis). I stopped it immeditly.",4
blood pressure is still high after years of use.,3
It is my first time taking this medication because of my blood prssure,3
I have a problem with incomplete bowel movements. Sometimes I feel as though I did not properly practice proper cleaning technique after eliminating which leaves me feeling qwishy.,5
This medication seemed to work for me until I had no more rx coverage and couldn't afford it.  But noticing some people on this developed leg wounds after injury don't heal anyone have the same problem?,4
"I forgot to mention something. In addition to improved diet and walking every day, I have been drinking apple cider vinegar in a glass of water once or twice a day. I can't say this has helped normalize my BP without meds, but I don't know that it hasn't. There are numerous websites describing the health benefits of ACV. Check for yourself. If you decide to try it, stir one or two tablespoons of raw organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with ""mother"" into a full glass of water. (Mother is the name for the little cobwebby nutrients that float in the vinegar.) Bragg is a good brand. So is Hain. If you don't like the vinegar taste, stir in a little honey. I first started doing this to help my irritable bowel but it has the rep for controlling BP as well. Be patient and give it a few weeks; nothing will happen overnight. ",1
"I posted on 7/21 about getting off Diovan.  I had to do something because the drug was causing unacceptable levels of bowel looseness plus a number of other annoying side effects. I was amazed at how easy it was to normalize my BP by becoming more active and improving my diet. The most important thing I can say here is get off your rear and get moving! Walking is ideal because it is gentle and works almost all your muscles. Start out slow and build up gradually. Start your new program several weeks before attempting to reduce your meds, and then talk to your doc first.",3
"I stopped taking Diovan about a week ago. Several weeks prior to that, I started walking about a mile a day, every single day, half in the a.m.and half in the p.m. I walk fast enough to be out of breath when I get home. I also improved my diet. More fish & seafood, whole grains, more fruits & vegies, almost no sweets. I feel better than I have in several years with a lot more energy. Saw the doc today for a followup after quitting Diovan. My BP was 124/82 WITHOUT any meds at all. So tonight I celebrate. Bottom line, be sure you really need those drugs. ",3
I am so glad I found this site- I have been so worried about my health-I have been taking Diovan for over 2 years and for the past 8 months I have been unusally tired and the pain in my lower back is so bad I can't stand at the kitchen sink to do dishes-I have to keep sitting down and thought I needed to see a chiropractor. Making a Dr. appt today. Thanks for letting me know I am not alone.,3
"I quit taking Diovan and am making major lifestyle changes instead.   If you are plagued with side effects, that means your body hates the stuff and it probably isn't good for you. What good is artificially ""normal"" BP if it's causing so many other problems? People still have strokes & heart attacks while on BP meds.  Better to try to control it naturally and keep the body happy.    Suggestion if BP meds are a must: Try low doses of 2 or even 3 meds rather than high doses of a single med. This is suggested by my cousin who is a pharmacist. He says doing this minimizes side effects.",1
"Borderline high BP (used to be considered normal), so maybe I don't even need it. Has caused rashes, itchy skin, chronic chapped lips and diarrhea. Like most drugs, this stuff is poison. I'm going to try lifestyle changes instead.",2
"Is this a diuretic? I have cramps in my legs and feet and can not rest or sleep. I get restless legs when ever I start to relax. I had my blood checked and lab  report said to stop diuretic, amd I am low on sodium. my blood pressure is fine.",5
"I've taken diovan for several years. I'm having pain in feet. Stopped taking diovan. The pain and pressure was better with a beta blocker, but felt tired and sleepy. Started taking ramipril. My foot pain has returned plus a cough. Pressure is still high 143/93. I'm very sensitive to medication.I'm ready to give up on bp medication. What shall I do?",3
it lower it sometime but it goes back to high,2
"i have alot of side effectives, coughing,joint pain, seems like i always have a cold",1
I have been taking divan for a year. I have just had blood taken that has shown my bilirubin out of whack. The only thing that is different is the Diovan. Could this be the cause?,5
"Diovan was my first attempt at drug therapy for HBP...lowered my 140/95 down to 120/80 fairly quickly, but after 1 month of use, noticed dramatic heart palpatations, usually when resting.  Felt this wasn't healthy, and switched to Lisinopril...so far so good.",3
My blood pressure was about 170 over something like 120 when I was diagnosed. I have been taking 160 MG daily for about one year and my blood pressure consistently remains at normal levels while I experience no side effects. I am well pleased with this drug.,5
My doctor prescribed 320mg/12.5 Diovan HCT. I have experienced lower back pain. Muscle spasm and muscle in eye jumping. Dizzyness when standing and numbness in hand and arms at times when sleep.It did lower my pressure but it went back up. Please help with natural suggestion.,2
My wife has taken this pill for years and has problems with alopecia.  I had always had a full head of hair before starting this medication.  Why isn't this listed as a side effect?,3
I am very satisfied with this medicine,5
SERIOUS JOINT MULFUNCTION - FINGERS HAVE PAIN THAT CAN NOT TYPE OR HOLD THE MOUSE ,1
just starting to take meds,3
this drug was a substitute for Norvasc to which i had an adverse reaction (Gum swelling).After 2 weeks use it has failed to keep my systolic pressure below 150.,2
"used to take HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE25MG  last 5 years in USA /In canada doctor gave me diovan80mg+hydrochlorothiazide25mg BP ok but  NO sex drive  nothing ,terrible itching if I exposed to the sun/ family doctor here in canada pre historic,they don,t have internet excess they don,t update their knowledge but free visitation/and drug pretty expensive they charge refill fee  even if you buy box of prescribe medicine.",3
i was switched to diovan because lisinopril caused cough. but diovan causes joint pain and foot hurts and now sensitivity to sunlight. i m only 37 so it is definately a n issue. pain in legs i had never experienced ,5
Been taking 160 mg for about 3 yrs.  No side effects.  Controlled my BP at first  but has stopped working. Dr. upped amt. to 320 mg but didn't work. Started taking a different drug today.,2
sore rectum,5
I think it is causing leg pain - severe,3
"I am taking for high blood pressure, but after one week being on it, i was very lethargic. i cut the dose down to 1/2 pill per day and that worked very well for me.....",4
helped BP but made me loss my sex drive ,3
"I ride a bicycle in Florida. Last week and this I developed a terrible, itching on portions of my body exposed to the sun. Is there another hypertension medication I can take that will not have this side effect? Riding regularly keeps my BP at 115/71 and I really don't want to give that up!",4
"I posted a review last week on 5/13 after my diagnosis. Well - after taking this for a week, my pulse rate has increased and I feel like I have the shakes. Today - I was changed to Avapro (150 mg) and after reading the reviews, this drug is less effective on African Americans so now I have to deal with discrimination of a drug .  Wow - I am gonna lose weight and hopefully do away with all of this. I am now 205 so I lost 6 lbs. (probably water), I have started exercising and also changing my diet.  With the help of God -- this will be done! The doctor feels that the diuretic part is what is giving me the shakes but overall, my BP decreased from 144 / 92 to 117 / 78 (today)... so it may work for some but not for me! ",2
Switched from Lisinopril to Diovan (Big price difference) 2 years ago due to cough. Have seen good results although I get light headed and server headaches. When i exercise then wait 1 hour prior to taking later in the day I will get extreme headaches that knock me down for several hours. On the days I do not exercise no headaches? I plan on cutting dosage and watch BP. Otherwise beside price it has worked.,4
I was just diagnosed today and I am somewhat in doubt and just frightened. I received Diovan and I took the first pill. I am scheduled to take for 1 month and review with doc. I plan on losing weight because I do not want to take this for the rest of my life. My BP today was 144 / 90 and I am 44 yrs old and 211 lbs. Dr. advised me to lose weight and that is where I stand (presently).  One visit to the Dr. or BP check should not confirm such a condition.. ,1
"Took my first dose of 160 mg accompanied with Toporol 25 mg at night (also take 1 toporol 25 during the day). Doctor switched me to this med because of bad side effects from lisinopril. Within 2 hours of taking the Diovan, I developed itching. First on head then hands, arms and legs followed. I am calling doctor tomorrow. This sure is frusterating! No other symptoms from diovan to report, but then again, it is only 5:00 and first dose was taken at 1:00.",1
I find the price of the medication keeps going up too much! And there is no generic here in the USA although it has been on the market manny years now but there is a generic in Canada. WHY?,5
"I have had no problems at all taking this drug.  I began taking it after lung surgery and a chemo drug, Avastin, made me have high blood pressure for the first time in my life.  I was on 4 different high blood pressure meds to get blood pressure down and I slowly cut down on all meds except for Diovan which I now take 160 mg.",5
"I have been on this drug 80 mg for years. I cough all the time,sore throat, hair loss on head and hair growing on face. Not good being a woman. I wish people would say to what they drug they switched.",4
"My BP was 160/97. Doctor wanted me on 80mg, I refused and said I'd take 40 mg. That has worked and am now in the 120/70 range. I am 51, 130lbs and fit. Only complaint is dry skin, dehydrate easily, fatigue.",5
ichen after taken this medication,2
"My doctor put me on Lisinpril initially; it made me cough so much, I stopped taking it. She then put me on diovan, 160 Mg's per day, then doubled it.  It brought my bp down, but not low enough. Being an herbalist, I looked into an Ayurvedic formula called Mutka Vati-this works like a charm!  I'm still on meds, after finding the correct dosage of both; brought my bp down to 115/75, which is exactly where I want it.  I will bring this to my doctor and tell her I want off these meds.  I am constantly exhausted while on it, and I don't want to be dependent on meds.  Mukta Vati can be found on ebay, google the term and Ivy's is the brand I bought.  Very satisfied with it!!",4
"I've been taking Diovan for 7 years now..  gradually over time I've had to increase my dosage.. I'm now on 320 mg. This drug has given me all the side effects: headache, loss of sex drive, fatigue, back pain, extreme leg pain, leg tingles/numbness, muscle pain, jitters, and muscle spasms.   However, it has done a great job in controlling my BP. I was 225/110 and now I'm 120/75. If you can deal with the exhaustion, it's a great medication and will DEFINITELY work.",4
"If I didn't have to work I could deal with the side effect of lethargy, back pain and my calves are sore all the time. I also take lisinopril and catapres. I initially took Norvasc and my legs became very swollen and hurt. This meds were prescribed after I had a series of TIA's in early Jan.'09. I'm a school teacher and I'm having a very tough go of it. Very tired all the time.",4
my blood pressure is under control,4
"experienced serious sinus,and upper lung problems",3
"I was on the 80mg Diovan and it failed to lower my blood pressure. Dr changed me to the 180 and was working fine for a couple weeks. After 3 week, I started to feel muscle pain in my legs, my jaw started hurting, felt my skin itch, increased heart rate and started to feel jittery/anxiety. Going to the doctor tomorrow to get a new prescription.  Are there are natural alternatives to Diovan?",3
"Tried this out after finding out that Benicar was not a preferred drug on my insurance. Did fine for about a week but for feeling alittle light headed. But soon my left lower back and right heel were killing me. Could barely walk more less exercise. Doctor said the pain was not related. She switched me to Lisinopil because of the dizziness with pressure reading 96/55 (was 159/89). She told me to start with 5mg, I'm starting at 2.5 and monitor my pressure at home. I've been free of Diovan for a day and my back/heel is already SO much better! Thanks everyone for your reviews.",5
"I went to the doctor for severe headaches at the back of my head and neck.  Blood pressure WAY high - 200/100 ! Scary.  Diovan 160 did not help.  Changed to Diovan 320 and been on that for a year.  No side effects.  Keeps my BP ""normal"" - last doctor visit 120/80.",5
stop my sex life,1
Have been taking Diovan for about three years. I have to keep increasing the dose. Started with 80 mg. Went to 160 mg. Now on 320 mg. It's been keeping my numbers at good levels. Feel a little tired at times but would never consider dropping Diovan.,4
Satisfied with drug,5
"Fatigue, muscle and joint pain, still high heart rate, HAIR LOSS.  Does anyone else suspect hair loss from high blood pressure medications?  Diovan does lower blood pressure, though, but who wants a bald head unnecessarily so.",3
I had a coughing effect from the drug,4
"I've been on Diovan for 2 years and it has controlled my BP well.  I have experience lower back pain, fatigue, and chronic sinusitis.  I'm now considering discontinuing the Diovan to see if it alleviates my sinus issues, otherwise it has worked well.",4
Previously took Lisinopril which caused severe coughing daily and loss of voice. Diovan eliminated the cough completely. My concern is the cost of this brand Rx is quadrupled that of Lisinopril. I am looking for a generic alternative that does not cause severe coughing.,5
"Headache,nausa,heartburn,dizzness,musle weakness and pain,joint pain, after taking 60mg for 10days became confused with numbness in fingers and toes, agatated. Heart rate stayed between 90 and 102. urine turned dark. Sleepless for nights.This drug should be taken off the market, it is very dangerous.",2
"My blood pressure was excessively high 200/90.  My doctor prescribed 160 mg 1 X per day.  Within a week my BP was significantly reduced.  After 5 months my BP hovers around 117/76.  I have to make sure I drink plenty of fluids.  At times I experience mild dizziness if I stand too rapidly;  otherwise, no side effects.",5
is their another drug in Tier 1,3
"BP was 160 / 94  Started years ago w/Diovan 40mg ---now have Diovan 80. BP 130 / 70; no side effects, but may have some sexual diminishing effects.  Seems to work well!!",5
been on diovan 80mg for about a year take one aday bp was 130 over 90 now 120 over85 i used to get bad headachs in the back of head i dont get them anymore only prob is the dizziness which doesnt last all day tried stopping the medicine for a week an the headachs came back after a glass of wine so i csn deal with a little dizziness,4
"I took this drug for 3 or 4 years.  It lowered my blood pressure pretty well but I had to increase the dosage to 80 mcg (I'm very sensitive to drugs) about a year ago.  I gradually started to feel worse and worse, with my back aching and soon my joints and muscles.  I couldn't exercise without 3 days of really sharply sore muscles.  I told my doctor about the sore back and joints and muscles and was told that ""It's part of getting old"".  But it wasn't.  I finally pulled/tore a ligament and muscle in my shoulder and needed Physical Therapy.  Through all of these sore backs and joints and muscles, I was taking Ibuprofen just to function in my daily life.  My doctor ran my blood tests and my liver function tests were bad.  Bad enough that she took me off of Diovan.  It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders--within 2 days I could get out of bed without hobbling when I started to walk.  My back started to feel better. My shoulder began to heal.  I could exercise and not be sore for 3 days. I don't need Ibuprofen anymore. My normal energy level has returned. And my liver function tests are getting better.      I should have insisted that my doctor take me seriously when I told her my muscles and joints and back hurt and that the hurt was different from sore muscles, much sharper.  Plus, what good is a drug if you need an NSAIDS to tolerate it's effect on your body.  Hopefully my liver is not permanently damaged!  ",4
"I started with 160mg and had to go up to 320mg. 320mg did the job very well. I tried diet, exercise, but the only thing than helped me was medication, I used to be > 160/95, now i'm hovering around 125/85. I had no side effects at all, at least not yet, I'm 32, and have been on this for 3 years.",5
This drug killed my sex drive.,4
OK,3
"blood preasure was 170/80 with diovan now 130/60 very good, no side effects",5
"It takes 2 hrs before the medication begin to lower the B/P and it doesn't produce a desirable B/P reading, ie 140/70. 80mg 2 times a day is ordered. B/P reading 155/72.",3
My husband is on this medication has done very well,4
"Great med, very little side effects (if any at all). Easy to take.",5
"I was first given enalapril. This worked fairly well, but my physician was concerned about my 'dry cough'. I was changed to Valsartan (80mg). This did not affect my (labile but often high) BP. Another physician increased the dose to 160 mg per day. This has made no difference. The side-effects are very slight (slight gastric distress). Will need to consider alternatives. (Magnesium supplementation seems to help, as does a low dose of Diazepam and massage as well as Coenzyme Q10.)Valsartan is expensive and does not work for me. The original physician did not like the idea of Thiazide diuretics (he was concerned about metabolic disturbances. Perhaps I should concentrate on 'life-style' changes? I am currently in a sedentary and stressful job.    ",1
I had no symptoms od Hypertension until I had my B.P.taken at a Health Fair. My physician put me on this drug because it worked for him I have had no problems except I had to be put on a beta-blocker also.,4
"Started on the lowest dose and BP high. Dr. gradually increased to 120 mg and side effects were horrible: headaches, joint pain, tiredness and more and BP still high.  Very unhappy and stopped taking",1
I sometimes get lightheaded and faint feeling.Wondering if this could be from the medicine,5
"160 mg every 3 days, all was fine---went to 160 mg daily, dizziness especially when standing up, would wake up with heart pounding, difficulty sleeping, jittery, eating an enormous dinner--I am glad I am not alone and found this website!",4
"Have been on Diovan 80mg for 3+ years. No problems except dystolic stayed high. Added amlodipine 2.5 mg 2 weeks ago. Combination of meds seem to have brought on dizziness, feeling faint, low energy, & rapid hair loss. BP under control, side effects increasing stress level. Not sure the combo is what I need.",4
"I feel a slight sense of tiredness on this medication, but not enough to consider requesting a change.",5
Is there a non-diuretic form of Diovan???,4
"I have been on 180mg. of diovan for about 3weeks.  I have dreams all night and wake up feeling groggy.  I had the same experience with lisinopril.  I almost dread going to sleep at night.  However, I have felt o.k. during the day.",2
Started on Avalide 10 yrs ago and worked fine but my doctor chose Lisinopril since it was free for me on my insurance - terrible cough all day and night long.  Changed to Diovan and seems to be working though I would like to see my numbers a bit lower.  It's been only a few months and I'll give it a few more to see if there's a change.,4
"My BP dropped from about 150/90 to 116/60. I was on Lisinopril and had horrible side effects(tiredness, muscle pain, no sex drive, bad cough). So far things are better with Diovan. I am slightly tired on Diovan, but nothing too bad at all. ",4
"hands and feet very cold, finger tips senitive and rurn a yellowish color sometime",4
"Have been taking for about 3 months now. Started with 80mg, had problems. Among the worst was extremely agitated. Got upset, felt like blood rushing to my head, felt like something was about to happen. Had to lay down to calm down. Reduce the amount to 40mg and kind of tolerating it. Headaches, muscle weakness and pain, head whirling, sinus aches daily and infections, back pain. BP not reduced so far as much as would like. I think I need an internist doctor??",3
Have been on 80mg 2wk and lowered bp from 150/100 to 126/85. Also take ioomg ToprolXL daily.Have not noticed any negative side effects.,4
"I was on this drug for approximately 3 months.  It helped to lower my blood pressure a little bit, but not enough, so Dr. increased dosage.  Blood pressure started going back up, acquired a weight gain from an increased appetite and a very strange dry, scabby rash on my lower back and stomach.  Biggest problem with this drug was the ""hangover"" type of effect I had every morning when I tried to get up.  I don't drink alcohol or do other drugs at all.  Dr. has now switched me over to Lisinopril which is working quite well - some side effects but not like with Diovan.",2
"There may be other factors inhibiting rhe full response expected from Diavan, like, not strong enough, which I have to discuss with my Dr.",3
Very satified however there is no generic replacement for this. Can be costly.,5
Slow in to bring blood pressure down and doe not seem to last the whole day.,3
Extreme muscle pain,3
"My doctor prescribed DIOVAN - 80MG. 1XDAILY. I am Diabetic, type 2, and she just prescribed Glipizide...had me discontinue Triam, and the latest RX states 2 Diovan 80 mg. per day, plus 1/2 80 mg pill in evening. My blood pressure is under control; so I question why the large increase in dosage.",5
Had earlier tried taking the 320mg. Very bad results so tried the 80mg. Was only able to be on for 1 week. Chest felt like I was having asthma continuosly without the wheezing.  So took myself off the med and went back to Atenolol which I was also on at the same time. Will see what dr. tries next.,1
"I take this medicine to prevent hypertension since I have kidney disease and hypertension would only further my disease.  It has worked great in protecting my kidneys, however the swelling of my feet, ankles and lower legs has made my life hell when it acts up.  My doctor is positive its the diovan causing my edema, but since my father had kidney disease that led him to a transplant, my doctor is putting the kidneys first and my swollen legs second.",4
"My Dr. has Rx'd Diovan HCT 320 for high blood pressure.  It somewhat works for that, but REALLY EFFECTS my asthma!  I have coughing spells that are out of control!  So, I did my own on-line research and found the side effects are worse than the high blood pressure!  It seems that ALOT of the Rx'd meds have MORE side effects that are much worse than the original problem!!!  Whether it was smart or not, I stopped taking Diovan on my own because the coughing was so bad!!!  However, I will be contacting my Dr with my decision.  ",3
"I HAVE BEEN ON DIOVAN FOR TEN YEARS AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS. RECENTLY HAD A HEAT ATTACK AND WAS PUT ON COREG ALONG WITH DIOVAN 40.  MY STOMACH HAS BEEN EXTREMELY UPSET AND SWELLS UP WITH SO MUCH BLOATING WITH EITHER FOOD OR WATER.  FIRST I WENT OFF THE COREG, DIDN'T HELP.  THEN I WENT OFF THE DIOVAN AND THE STOMACH PROBLEMS WENT AWAY TWO DAYS LATER.  I'VE HAD SCANS, UPPER GI, AND LOWER WHICH HAS SHOWN NOTHING WRONG.  THESE TWO DRUGS DID NOT FAIR WELL TOGETHER AND THE DIOVAN DID NOT PREVENT A HEART ATTACK.  I ALSO HAD LEG PAINS AND MANY JOINT ACHES DURING THE YEARS WHILE TAKING DIOVAN.  ",1
"Dr. for some reason started me on the 320 mg. My reaction was severe spiking 200/101 and dropping to 112/59 2 hours after taking pill.  My chest started hurting and I began gasping for breath with movement. Spent most of my time in a chair. After 1 week I stopped pill myself.  Dr. then gave me the 80 mg and I am doing fine. No side effects, but b/p not dropping as fast as we would like so I will probably agree to take the next step up.",3
"I took Diovan 160 for five days.  On the fifth day, I felt dizzy in the morning, then in the afternoon my heart began racing.  I called my MD who at first thought I was having a panic attack, but I have never had one before.  My body temperature dropped to 97.  Then my feet turned white.  I felt very cold all over and shivered for the whole five days.  I also became sensitive to light and sound.  The left side of my face and my left foot became numb, which lessened, but did not disappear even after I stopped the Diovan.  ",1
This meds sure keeps my bp under control,5
"have been on other BP med and had dry cough and bad back ache, told Dr and was switched to Diovan 160 mg no cough but bad back ache and and nausea like morning sickness with this one only been on it a month but BP doesnt seem to be stablizing it seems to spike.",3
"I've been on this medication for about five months now.  It really helped to lower my b.p., but when my dosage was changed from 80 mg everyday to 40 mg everyday, I've noticed that my bp has been slightly elevated.  I feel jittery sometimes and my heart rate goes up way too easily.  Has anyone else experienced this?",4
"BP: 190/80 Prescribed 180mg, 1.5 week later BP 135/80. Did not like the $40 co-pay! Told Doc and she gave me several sample packs of 320mg and said I could double the pills I have left to make 320mg. I am trying to save not increase dose. Will cut 320mg in half to 180mg. So far, only slight headaches.",4
"Couldn't handle the 160 mg.  Can only equate the side effects as making me feel like I was in the first trimester of pregnancy, minus the vomiting.  Total exhaustion.  80 mg seems to be tolerable.",3
"Started on 40mg 6 months ago.  No side effects but did not control my BP 4 weeks ago, Dr. doubled to 80mg. Have had persistent HA, fatigue,joint pain, foot, lower back, neck and rt. arm pain. Fingers on right hand swollen.  Relayed these side effects to my Dr.-she prescribed migraine med. This is my second ACE inhibitor-both causing bad reactions. ",3
"I've been on Diovan for about 3 months. It does control my BP but, there are drawbacks. Switched to taking it at night due to the fatigue it was causing (couldn't keep my head off my desk at work.)  When I take at night, it is like taking a sleeping pill - until the dieretic kicks in.  I am typically up several times a night to use the bathroom now.  I suppose there is a perfect time of day to take this med but, I have yet to find it.",4
"I have been taking this medication for about 6-8 months and it has only controlled my blood pressure for part of the day. I have developed swelling of the ankles/legs, gout, weight gain and blurred vision - am going back to the doctor again for yet another medication but am taking myself off of this one",3
"irruglar heart rate, Drop to very low BP and then high BP. Suspect it has an effect on my eyesight. I have an Appointment today with my DR",2
"My blood pressure kept around 150/90, though I usually was 200/100 plus, then I started feeling the effects as of poisoning as it happened years ago with shellfish.  (Except diareah)  As soon I stop taking it, my blood pressure came 120/60 and below, the combination was am: Norvasc 10 mg., HCTZ 25 mg and pm: Atenolol 25 mg.  Also gained 2 pounds each month.  As soon I stopped, have loose the same, 2 pounds each months, for a year, I am now my same weight I was when I started taking the Diovan.  I was a PPA patient.",1
"Diovan(80mg)along with Toprol worked wonderfully at keeping my BP under control. Just an FYI, it did give me nightmares almost every night!  I know it was the diovan, because less than a week of going off of it due to trying to get pregnant, my nightmares completely stopped (and i'm still on the toprol). For me it was worth it though, as it kept my BP low.",5
"Been on this med for over two years and have developed leg cramping, joint pain, feet swelling, and gout diagnosis.  Willbe changing my doctor because he emphatically states these conditions not caused by drug.  never had these symptoms prior to using this drug.  Doctor is as bad as the drug!",3
I have been using Diovan for 4 years with no side affects.  My blood pressure was 165/95.  I just had it checked again.  It was 126/83.  ,5
My blood pressure is down to normal after 4 weeks of using.  Side effects is being lethargic and sleepy but will try to tolerate and see if this will subside after longer use.,4
"For high blood pressure, Dr prescribed Diovan HCT/Altenolol/Norvasc. Took Norvasc away,doubled the 160 Diavan to two/day. Blood pressure still uncontrolled. No side effects of medication. ",1
"I am wondering what other drugs can be used in place of diovan. My husband has recurrent pain in his knees, ankles and feet, which include swelling and inability to walk due to pain and restictive movement in these areas. I understand that joint pain is a known side effect of this drug. ",4
"Have just been on 40 mg. diovan for a week. Have been experiencing very bad leg pain. After reading other reviews, will call pharmacist to see if he thinks these awful leg pains are due to the diovan. Seems to be bringing my blood pressure down. If this side effect will improve with time will continue to take.",3
Was taking 160mg with no side effects until recently.  Dizzines then started about 1/2 hr after taking the drug.  Switched to 80mg and dizziness stopped.  BP dropped to a steady 115/74 since taking it.,5
"Started out taking the HCT Diovan but it was too strong, made my arms go numb during sleep. Switched to the regular 160mg Diovan with better results. It has made me dizzy at times but it has been tolerable. When squatting be careful when standing, some dizziness may occur, it does with me. I have taken this medicine for several years and so far no major issues. My blood pressure varies from 115/75 to 135/85. Good luck with it! ",4
"SINCE I STARTED THIS MEDICATION 2 WEEKS AGO, MY BLOOD PRESSURE HAS INCREASED TO A STAGE 2 HYPERTENSION, SEVERE HEADACHES, DIZZINESS HEART RATE INCREASE FROM 99 TO 118, I EVEN TRIED GETTING OFF AND CONDITION WORSEN ,UNTIL I CAN CALL MY DR. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.",1
Took 320mg for 3 days. Good dizzy and blacked out falling on my face and injuring my nose and head. ,1
"The effect this drug had on me were dizznes ,pins and needle sensations in my head as well as feelings of  something crawling in my head at top and heartbeat in the middle and top of my head.",3
dizziness,2
It worked for my blood pressure.,4
Type 1 diabetic (18yrs) with insulin pump and have been using this suggested by my endocrinologist for the last few years to help kidneys work easier. Alot of doctors who treat diabetics suggest using an ace inhibitor to help with diabetic renal issues but I tried ACE inhibitors and got really really dizzy all the time. I do not have high blood pressure but he seems to think that this ARB as its called works good by taking stress off kidney function. I cannot really claim any serious side affects from it other then sometimes my ankles swell ( end of day ) thats it. No cough or anything like that for me. You might ask your MD about it as an alternative to an ARB if you get really dizzy though...it worksed for me great no problems. ,4
"Until I read in my nursing drug book, I didn't know to drink 8oz of water with  the medication. This is when I noticed that the medication was effective.",3
does not totally control high blood pressuer,2
"its been very effective, it immediately reduced my pressure to 120/80.  I'm just wondering if any other patient on this drug is expieriencing this probelm.  I started two months ago, I got terrible pressure on top of my head then two days later I had difficulty walking straight.  My primary and Neurologist dent me to the hospital for a cat scan and mri.  They showed nothing but for two weeks I had to walk with a walker.  Now I'm still dizzy off and on.  No one knows why, could it be diovan?",5
"Started out with Diovan 80mg.  Not too many side affects.  Doc increased dose to 160mg and it made me sick, sick.  Stiffness in legs, lower back pain, chest discomfort, bloating, could not stand for long periods of time.  Asked to be taken off this med and will now try Cozaar along with Clonidine.",3
"took this for 6 months, while it lowered my BP joint pain was too much- trying something else now. ",3
This is the 3rd HBP medication we've tried and I had the same allergic type reaction as I did to the other two.  I actually thought I was having a heart attack. Stopped after the second day.,3

Drug lowered blood pressure to 112/69. Sexual side effects have been bad for me. Need to find something else.,5
"Following CABG-5 surgery I was put on Lotensin 40mg/Coreg 12.5mg bid along with a couple other meds for other non-related conditions. I was discharged 6 days after surgery, full recovery within 10 days, bp remained steady at 140/80 consistantly for two years. My Family Practice MD changed the Lotensin to Diovan 7 months ago. My bp is all over the place, cannot keep anything on down, have lost almost 75 lbs, cannot stand, have developed Orthostatic Hypotension (bp drops upon standing) so bad that I have fallen twice requiring sutures/stapes, several other times not as serious. The change was due to post-nasal drip. Now the problem has become critical, but nobody believes that the symptoms started 7-10 days after starting the Diovan. I have never suffered from stomach cramps this bad in my life, even with diverticulosis/litis. I know this is the problem, but I cannot get my MD to agree. I have not been able to hold anything on my stomach for longer than 20-30 mins after eating, even water. My feet look like they're going to explode! I'm going to the ER in the morning to have staples removed and my Family MD told me not to sign the d/c papers and insist that I be admitted for further testing and he will be involved.",3
I have developed a dry cough.I had a similar experience with Norvasc only must worse with Norvasc. Could Diovan cause a dry cough?,4
"I am a 54 yr old female who has been on Diovan for 3 yrs, which is how long I have had swelling in my legs and feet. I read all of the reviews about this medicine and how others have had swelling.Two days ago I stopped taking it, my ankles and legs are going down. Thank you all for your reviews. I am going to my doctor today and have him change my medication.",2
"Began with 80mg.  Back to doctor and BP still too high, dose increased to 160mg along with Ditalizem.  Headaches now on the larger dose.  Some leg pain, but not severe.  Back to doctor in a week, so I'll see.",1
I was on Diovan prior to my pregnancy and following my pregnancy. I am very pleased with this medication. I have no side effects other than a little tiredness.,5
I have been taking Diovan 320mg for 2 years. I have experienced lower BP but ankles swell and I have terrible leg and muscle cramps at night. I also think it contributes to my joint pain as well.,5
"my experience with this medication is excelent,never experienced any side effects,my bloodpressure has been under control ever since taking this medication!!   ",5
"I do not like to use any drugs. I am looking for a natural treatment method. Diovan did lower my BP fromaverage 140/90 to 120-115/80-75, but I don't like the wide fluctuation of the individual readings and what they in reality indicate. I'd like to know more concerning the inter relatedness of the various scores.",5
"I experienced the most annoying side effect of dry eye and dry nose. Every morning my eyes would water for hours and my dry nose was so painful inside that I had to apply petroleum jelly several times a day. The dermatologist and internist told me it was due to menopause, but finally an eye doctor told me it was the medication. I went off the med and my eyes and nose problem was rectified within 3 days.",3
May have taken 160 mg instead of 80mg,5
this is my every first time using this,5
A little tired but find this drug effective. No other side effects on 80mg.,4
"n side effects, controls blood pressure",5
I DO HAVE LVH DUE TO UNCONTROLLED HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS IS THE FIRST DRUG THAT HAS CONTROLLED MY BLOOD PRESSURE COMPLETELY. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY SIDE EFFECTS.  ,4
"Took 80mg with no side effects; doctor raised to 160mg. B/P still too high according to doctor. At home readings were lower.  Tried the Diovan with HCT, swelled up like a balloon, had horrrific joint pains, and pressure went UP. Tried another combo, and made it for two weeks; then had joint pains, terrible cramping, carpal tunnel agony, swollen ankles, and difficulty swallowing. Doctor insisted I try Diovan 320mg. B/P is good, but by 8th day have terrible back pain, all joints very painful, and now I'm itching.  I cannot sleep more than 4 hours, am tired, weak as a kitten, and irritable. Need to take both Ibuprofen and Benadryl which both raise B/P, to survive. Where is this going?  ",4
"Started with low dosage of this then increased to 320 mg.  Have severe rash and think it is from this medication.  Not sure but I took lower dosaage for 3 or 4 weeks then increased had rash before increase and it is getting worse.  Am alsmost sure from this, I will be calling my Doctor tomorrow.  Has anyone else developed a rash from this Diovan?",1
I have been on this for about a week and a half. About 20 minutes after taking it I had terrible headaches. This week I had a migraine and nausea for three days. Last night I got such bad cramps in my feet and legs my left foot is swollen and has some bruising. Nurse doesn't think the cramps would cause. I think she's wrong. Haven't done anything to hurt my foot. Now I can hardly walk. Also had diarehha and almost passed out last night. I quit taking it. It's not worth feeling like crap all of the time.,2
My BP was 150/100. My doctor prescribed DiovanHCT  160/25 in Jan 2007.I was also told to have a ripe banana daily to keep my potassium levls up. I also snack on 3-5 dried apricots daily. So far no side effects whatsoever. No headaches nor fatigue. I work out at the gym 5 days a week and walk for half an hour every day after lunch. My BP now is 117/74,5
Having taken Diovan for about 2 years @ 160 mg and have experienced no side effects. Dr. sugessted NO caffene and all seems to be great - BP is now under control 46 year old female and no weight gain or problems - just wish it was alot cheaper.,5
Began taking my upgraded dosage about 7 days ago.  Feeling very tired in the early evening.  I've noticed also that I am eating bigger meals.,3
"Started Diovan 80/12.5 mg pill 6 months ago after taking Lisinopril, BP was 165/105 at the time.  Three months later, BP was 145/95 so doc increased dosage to 160/25 mg pill.  Three months later, BP is 135/85, doc maintaining dosage.  Feel lethargic at times, and if doing strenuous labor, can get dizzy quickly.  Also, have become somewhat forgetful while taking this medicine.  However, have lost 12 pounds in the last three months, possibly due to increase dosage.",3
"I have been on this for several months, got my chronic high blod pressure down when nothing else worked. Brings me down, tho, I feel very tired on the 160mg, and am gaining weight.",4
"I am a 39 year old female of average weight. I started Diovan 80mg 3 months ago.BP went from 140/90 down to 120/80 within 4 weeks.  However, after 3 months BP is back up now to 140/100.  Dr. doubled dosage yesterday to 160mg/day.(no previous side effects except slight weight gain) Today I have a terrible headache and feel achy all over.  I don't know if is from increased dosage or not. ",3
" Taken Diovan 180mg for 8 months now, it has lowered my BP to normal. Side effects I experience: 12 pound weight gain in the first 2 months, muscle pain and weakness especially after being on my feet for awhile, overall feel more tired, and more frequent acid reflux. Not sure if this medication is worth taking.",4
         have been using for a month and don'tknow yet of side effects ' has been lowering my pressure,4
"After reading the reviews..I feel somewhat better. Due to the fact that it's not a case of it being ""just me"".  I have been on Diovan for apprx 6mths (chngd from Lisinopril-bad cough)and have experienced chronic reflux issues, extreme hairloss and thinning, weight gain (very active 39 yr old female slightly overweight)joint pain, (knees creek and crack) slight libido change,but overall, BP has stabilized. Now the question is...with all the side effects,is there another, just as effective medication available?  Your reviews have really helped me narrow down the cause of my symptoms.  Thanks WebMd and the many reviewers.",4
"have been on Diovan for 3years,have back pain,cramps in my legs sometimes at night i wake up with the chills shaking all over,i have tried to take it at different times of the day,helps for awhile but the cramps start again",3
I've been on it for a while and my blood pressure is doing fine. It helps to drink a lot of fluids with this medicine. When I take the pill I follow with a full glass of water and usually drink about 4 more glasses throughout the day. It seems like a lot to drink but it helps to keep the headaches away.,4
PB was controlled with previous meds.  I have been on this medication along with water pills and my BP is still 159/95,1
"I am taking Divan 320/25 mg,  I understand that drinking water after taking the drug helps?  Is this correct?  If yes, how much should I drink",3
I have had high blood pressure for about 30 years. I have been a policeman for 42 years.,4
"While taking Diovan (80mg) I have experienced severe lower back pain, joint pain and fatigue.  I am stopping the med to see what happens.  It lowered my blood pressure though.",5
"59 year old caucasian with 10 year history of HTN. Was on 2.5 mg of Vasotec, but it stopped working three months ago (a lot to stress). MD put me on 320 mg of Diovan ... all hell broke loose: severe abdominal cramping; felt like I was getting an ulcer with gastic burning; explosive and watery stools; extreme fatigue; weak as a kitten (I was an Olympic lifter in my youth and am still very strong ... before Diovan); chest congestion; very runny nose; cannot make sense of a simple newspaper article (I have five graduate degrees); very cold extremities; and memory dysfunction. MD told me there would be no side effects! I hate this stuff! I will cut my dose to 80mg for the next week. I'd rather have the HTN. Be very cautious with this stuff (Diovan).",3
Reduced high blood pressure,5
I felt extremely great when I first started taking the medication.After about 3 weeks I started getting severe headaches that would last up to all day.They usually begin after about half hour to hour after taking it. The blood pressure has really dropped to normal readings and my heart rate has superceded all my expectations in descending by 15 points. This medication was prescribed for hypertension but I am concerned about the headaches since I'm not one prone to them there has also been a small amount of muscle cramping in the calves.The drug works well but I would stay in close contact with my physician and my pharmacist.,5
Take 80mg twice daily-could not tolerate the 160mg at one time.,4
"It has slowly lowered my blood pressure. I also used to get head aches, but when you take diovan, you have to drink a LOT of water or you will have head aches. It helps to drink stuff like gatorade or vitamin water or other fluids containing potassium to get rid of leg/muscle cramps, in spite of what it says on the ""drug interactions"" part.",3
since I started taking it I have had a severe headache. my eyes and the top of my head hurt severly please help.,2
they should check again the diploma of the research team  for the side effect on  reproductive organ: I am MALE and my wife had the second miscariage (@ 3 mth and 1.5 month)..nothing else has change in my life to be blame for that!!,3
copay cost has skyrocketed.,4
"My Doctor had to switch me to Avalide 300/25 for my severe hypertension, I am now at goal. Diovan was just not very effective",1
my blood pressure has dropped signifacantly since i have been on this medication. ,4
this caused a bad cough as my only side effect. ,5
i wonder if this drug or could it be topol rrol xl that is causing fatigue??,4
"INSURANCE COMPANT  DOES NOT WANT ME TO USE IT AS TOO EXPENSIVE,WANTS ANOTHER MEDICINE TO BE USED",4
This is the first time in 9 years that I have had to increase it. But this is due to some other conditions.  I prefer this over the Avapro which made me constantly cough. I have never had any side affects from this.  ,5
gave me rreally itchy rash  scared for life on entire body,1
"the blood pressure's been impressively lowered, but seem to have lots of fatigue, back pain, and joint aches with this med. Liked ToprolXL but developed a nasty cough and had to discontinue. Norvasc caused lots of swelling in lower extremities. Guess the Diovan is the best so far but would like to get rid of the back and joint pain that seems to be a side effect of the med. The 10 pound weight gain hasn't made me a fan of this med, either, but dropping the systolic pressure from 237 to 130 is pretty impressive. ",4
What are side effects when I stop taking Diovan?,5
I was put on Diovan for my high blood pressure and it really didn't help. I had tried an ACE inhibitor before Diovan and was taken off of that due to a cough. My doctor kept increasing the dose but my blood pressure remained high. My doctor switched me to Avalide 300/12.5 and my blood pressure is finally controlled. I'm happy with the new drug and it's working much better. I only have to take the Avalide once a day which is much better Diovan twice daily.,1
cough,2
Got hives on my neck & itching around my eyes esp with the Diovan HCT.  Systolic BP was around 125 - 135 but diastolic was a little high at 85 to 90.  Got periodic dizziness that was enough to affect my work performance. Ceased taking the Diovan HCT after 30 days as I got angry red itchy welts on my neck. Switched to regular Diovan & welts went away but the itchiness remained around eyes & dry somewhat itchy flat rash replaced the welts.  Discontinued after 2 months.,1
i am a female age 58 and has been talking this med now for a momth. i am having bad headache and my heart is racing very fast  and at night i can actually hear it beating.,2
"BP was typically 140/90 with systolic frequently spiking higher.  I take no other medications, am 46 years old, and overweight. I take 40 mg Diovan before bed - absolutely no side effects and BP has been consistently below 115/75. I started taking it 3 months ago.",5
"Since I started taking this medication, I am very tired, irritable, palpitations, very jittery and very dizzy.  I just don't feel right at all.",1
Since I began taking it my wrist fingers and arms having been hurting real bad,4

"BP was 145-140/90-85.  Dr. put me on 80 mg Diovan.  In 2 weeeks, BP dropped to 100/50.  Cut dose to 40 mg, BP now pretty stable at 115/75, pulse 60.  I'm in good shape; bike and windsurf all the time.  Feel great, no side effects now, but in the beginning, I was a bit tired in the afternoon. Have been taking Diovan for 2.5 months.  No other meds.",4
Diovan is not lowering the pressure like it was,5
"I am taking Toprol XL for high blood pressure which spikes too high. I have AFib and also take digoxin and coumadin. My doctor prescribed Diovan to help lower my BP since the Toprol was not keeping it low enough. After taking the Diovan for almost 2 weeks, I resumed getting heart palpitations(which have been minimal since starting ther other meds last June, 2007). Is this a known side effect of Diovan? I certainly do not want to continue to take it and have to deal with the palpitations again.",2
Does not seem to be working. Have been taking in conjunction with Triamterene and Labetalol.  Have had no change in blood pressure readings.,1
Blood pressure is great. 110/60,5
My husband has been on this drug for over a year. He's 59 and his blood pressure is 199 over 105. he is having cronick nose bleeding for the last 3 days. He's also on cardizem 240 mg.,2

i am having fruquent urinating.,2
"I am 43 and have had hbp for atleast 25 yrs.  I am 5'4, 145 lbs.  No other medication has worked as well as Diovan HCT. I would recommend this to anyone who has been through all of the insurance company approved drugs that I have tried. I take a dose of maxide with it as it appears that water retention is one of the causes of my hbp.  Nothing bad to say at all, except for BCBS telling me they won't pay for it as they want me to try alternative therapy.  However, I won't give it up.",5
Great drug! :),5
"Taking two levels of this drug does not quite stabilize my bp.  Additionally, it is very expensive and I'm looking for a suitable generic to keep my Medicare D costs down.",4

"heartburn,back pain,dizziness,libido,and eat more, hve to go back to dr in another week so we will see",4
Currently taking a low dose 12.5 mg.  For the most part it has been very effective except when in the Dr. office. Started taking my own blood preasure daily and realized how well it was working.  I also use the Resperate breathing program and feel that is how I get by on such a low dose of Diovan,4
I am tired all of the time and have headaches. I have been on it for 1 week now and my b/p has not changed. Do not want to gain weight but I think I have already,1
I wake up in the middle of the night having chills and can't get warm until I get up.  I tryed to nap today and the same thing happened.  Chills in my legs & arms.  I could not get warmed up until I got to my feet.  Then it was a while later.,4

"I have been using Diovan for 4 days now for Bp; and after reading many of the side effects from other users, I am able to identify them in myself. I started having backaches almost immediately; and joint pain which I had just gotten under control with holistic supplement has now returned, and I began to notice muscle weakness just this morning. I am dissappointed. I have stopped using this. I will continue holistic treatment of phitonutrients-Biovaxine- and see how next check-up is in 2 weeks.",3
"I have been on the medicine for 2 weeks...has not lowered bp, and I have a very irritating dry, hacking cough.  I had same problem with lisiniprol.  Am also taking atenolol, but it had kind of lost it's effectiveness. Don't know what to try next.",2

"Good drug for high blood pressurebut didn't realize it was the cause of my severe lower back pain until I quit taking it.  Within 24 hours, the pain was basically gone!",4

I have a high dose 160mg/25htc but that is what worked for me.  BP was 160/45 on a regular basis and now 125/75 is normal.  So it has worked well for me.,5
Blood pressure was lowered from 160/95 to 130/80.  No side effects noted.,5

It hurt when I ate, hurt worse when I didn't eat, so wound up gaining weight. had to go back on antacids but little help with the pain.

started taking medicine bp came down then went back up doctor doibled dose dizziness got worse bp stayed normal for about 6 months started getting headaches and sick feeling went back to doctor bp 160/90 changed to lisinopril no problems since,2
I have trouble paying the high price for this medication,5
I have been on Diovan for over 5 years. I've been very happy with it as I have tried others and experienced awful side effects. I love Diovan!,5
"Diovan worked to keep my blood pressure down, but it made me experience urgent, frequent, uncomfortable urination during my trial period.  ",3
My blood pressure has been in control since I began using the med. I have noticed no adverse side affects.,5
"This drug made me gain weight through a huge appetite change.  Doctor says ""not so"" but I got off it anyway and went to Atenolol.  ",3
"This drug makes me irritable, causes me to depersonalize, causes palpitations, jittery, nausea, just don't ""feel right.""",5
i am having problems with having a bad cough when i take this med.,3
"Stoped taking,30 days pressure went up. Started taking again,pressure eased back down.",3
BP not changed but I am dizzy now!,1
"Lowers my pressure, but my headache persists",2
Does not make a difference in my blood presure.,1
"I take this medicine at night before bed with food. it does wake me up to go to the bathroom. thats when I feel the side effects, lightheaded, headache..tried others and couldnt take them..mfg has discontinued. so i buy it online at a much cheaper price. other meds made me very sick. so i will stay with this as long as i can.",5
this has been the only HTN medication that has helped me with no side affects. And now they tell my DR. that it is no longer manufactured. And Im struggling with other meds that are not working for me.,5
"It appears that about 6-8 hrs after taking this drug, frequent and spontaneous urnation is a problem. So timing of taking the drug, especially if traveling is impotant. This is one of my disatisfactions with the drug.",4
The cost is too expensive. Can't afford it but without it I'll be in a danger zone.,5
Wonderful...no problems.,5
"I have had difficulty breathing on this drug,  tried to tell doctor it wasn't doing the job, the more I struggle to breathe, the higher the blood pressure goes.  ",2
I've have success with this drug for some time. I'm disappointed that I can no longer obtain it.  Does anyone know the real reason why the drub is not available?  Is it temporary?  I've tried two replacements so far; one didn't work and the other is pending opportunity.  Stay tuned.,4
"I had been on this medicine for 4 years and it controlled my blood pressure.  However, I did experience swelling of the ankles and feet. I have not been able to refill my prescription due to manufacture hold, and my physician has written a replacement medication.",4
This drug is currently not available from the manufacturer....Causing me to switch.,3
"I have been on this medication for 1 year, it has lowered my blood pressure. I have had mild symptoms with feeling dizzy and lightheaded, especially when I first get up in the morning.I have been sweating more than I normally do and have hot flashes. I have also been experiencing problems with my fingers, wrists and ankles swelling. The  worst part is the muscle cramps and back pains,especially at night. I wake up almost every night with cramps and shortness of breath. I have note been able to refill my prescription at my regular pharmacy since June of this year.  I finally found a pharmacy that did have the medication and now they to are out, also.  I life the Washington, DC area and no pharmacy on MD, DC, or VA can tell me when they can get it fill. I will be changing medication soon.",3
"This medicine put me in hospital with hyponatremia - nausea,vomiting,diarrhea,headache,sinus",1
This drug caused edema and muscle pains and cramps.  And this has been the hardest drug to get refilled I have ever experienced.  Not only had my long term pharmacy not been able to fill it since May '08 but my local pharmacy cannot refill it either.  I am switching from this medication as fast as possible and selling the pharmaceutical stock too.  Very disappointing.,3
"I have been on this medication for 4 months now.  It has lowered my blood pressure, but only by a few points.  I have not felt well while taking this medication.  I have had mild symptoms with feeling dizzy and lightheaded, especially when I first get up in the morning.  I constantly feel hot.  I will be sitting at my desk at work and have hot flashes.  I will start to sweat.  I feel so hot that I roll up my sleeves, remove my tie and sometimes have to excuse myself to go to the restroom and put wet washrags on my neck to cool off and keep from passing out.  I have also been experiencing problems with my fingers, wrists and ankles swelling.  In fact I no longer where a watch or my wedding ring, becuase they do not fit.  But the worst part is the muscle cramps, joint pain and back aches.  I wake up almost every night with cramps in my feet and calf muscles.  I take long hot showers a couple of times a day to try to relieve some of the pain and stiffness in my shoulders and back.",2
I felt like I had a constant severe migrane.  The effects of this medicine scared me.  I stop taking the medication because the side effects never went away.  ,1
It did help to lower my blood pressure but it caused severe headaches and dizziness.,5
Causes edema (swelling) of the ankles and feet.  Plan to discontinue and try something else.,3
I felt flush and hot for the whole time I took it.If i got around to much i felt dizzy and nausious.The sad part was that even after a month of taking it my blood pressure was still high. feeling like roadkill for a month for nothing.,2
"causes abdominal pain, headache, aching joints and bloating,palpitations. I also take labetolol. Which is the culprit, both?",2
I have been taking Edarbi for a month after being Dx. with HPB 150s/100s My 1st dose 40mg x1 a day. I took it for 2 days and it crashed my BP to 90/60 I stopped  taking it and started taking my BP 3x a day for 7 days my BP stayed under 140/90. Edarbi is a very strong pill. I have been forced to crack the pill into quarters and I hope that I am getting 10 mg. (as best as possible I am using a pill cutter but it is not exact) at this dosage I am able to maintain 120/80 day and night. ,5
Started with and have been on Edarbi 80mg for two weeks.  Lowers my blood pressure but causes dizziness after bending over or standing up. ,3
"Unbearable leg pain, constant nausea. Started at 40mg, then went up to 80mg. Did not lower blood pressure effectively. Gained 8 lbs in six weeks. ",1
It lowered my blood pressure without any side effects for 3 years now.,5
Was on this for two and a half weeks.  Lowered BP to much and dehydrated me.   Muscle cramps and very dizzy/lightheaded overall did not feel good on it.  Did not like it went to a different drug.  ,1
"Switched to Edarbi due to side effects of other bp med.Started at 80 mg  but switched to 40 mg/day. Highly effective with no side effects. BP typically below 120/80, more like 115/70. Good med.",5
"I was started on the 40mg and my pressure dropped slightly, now I am taking 80mg and I have feel better  that I have in a while.",5
"Controls by BP great, but having terrible back pain and sometimes strange taste in mouth.",3
Caused chronic kidney problems and gout - before taking it I had none of these problems. Not recommended!!,1
"Did not control BP well, hard to get below 150 systolic. Fatigue an issue.  Leg cramps an issue.  Worst, was the eczemma/red circles of peeling skin around both eyes--which took months to finally figure out that this drug was the culprit.   ",2
"feeling sick to my stomach, awful taste im my mouth.feel like a z0mbie.  Pill works but the side effects are awful",5
started edarbi 5 days ago due to weight gain from previous med. Gained 3 pounds in 5   days on Edarbi had severe pain in right side and lower back.  Unable to sleep due to pain.  Will call Dr. today and stop taking.,1
"After many years of different drugs for high B/P without great success, doctor put me on 80 mg of edarbi.  By the fifth day I was so weak I could hardly stand without holding on to something - incredible muscle fatigue with accompanying bouts of abdominal, back, and leg cramps/spasms. Six days later when it was still present and life altering, I phoned the doctor to report that I could not go on like this. She told me to take 1/2 tablet and monitor and let her know on Monday (a week from call) then she called back to say maybe it was the Paleo diet I was on.  I did not believe that for a moment as I am eating healthier than I have in years. AND I saw the reports here of the same issues I was having. It brought my B/P down dramatically - even low - so it works on the issue, but if these awful side effects do not go away by reducing to 1/2 tab, I will refuse to stay on this medication.",3
Blew my bp thru the roof. Prescribed when systolic was 160 range. Came off it after dose was doubled and bp by rose to 200/112 range necessitating an ER visit. Switched to Amlodipine and BP is now in 140 to 150/90 range. Edarbi = bad drug for me!,1
Have been in the red zone on the BP chart for years and have tried all kinds of meds to get my pressure down.  I was part of the last test trial group.  First response was I was dizzy because for the first time I had actual mid range BP.  I have now been back on it with my first actual normal BP rating.  This drug has saved my life by actually letting me get to a normal range.  I figure the complaints have been because the blood pressure they where lowering was not that high.  After years of being around 170 Systolic and very little time at the 130 range I would say again this drug has saved my life.  With the increase in potassium from this drug for once I got to cut out the added RX to help with how many BP meds remove this from your system.  I do get dizzy still but I have a lot of other health issues that now I do not have to include high BP to.  I take it at bed time with and without food. Most doctors do not know about this medicine.  I would recommend it for anyone with extremely high pressure but be careful if not. ,5
Have been taking for 3 weeks and also am experiencing Reynaud's syndrome which is not listed as a side effect.  Noticed one other person also listed this side effect.,5
"I have been taking Edarbi 80mg a day for about 6 months along with 2 other BP drugs. When my doctor started me on Edarbi my BP returned to a normal level within a couple of days and the hard pounding sensation I had with my heart went away. I have been on many different BP medications over the years but this is the only one that has satisfied me and my doctor. I currently take 80mg Edarbi, 10mg Amlodipine, 150mg Toporol. The Edarbi is the only one of these medications BCBS of Florida will not pay for and it works the best.",5
this medication has worked great for me. I was hospitalized 3 times in 3 months with high blood pressure. Nothing worked. My dr put me on edarbi and my blood pressure is perfect. ,5
"This is the 8th drug now I have been given to try to reduce my high BP.  Worked finally after about 2 weeks.  But then I started to get severe joint and muscle pain, starting in my most used joints ( driving leg knee, and left shoulder- I am left handed) Also sometime uncontrolable bowel movements.  Came off as an experiment, and symptoms subsided within 2 days.  Went back on and almost immediatly soreness came back.  I guess its back to the drawing board......",4
helps but Edarbi alone does not lower Blood pressure enough ,4
"Been on the medication for 4 weeks. Effective at reducing my high blood pressure. I takes so many other meeds its hard to tell the side effects. I have experenced light headedness and fatigue but nothing I cant work through. I have sleep apnea and I am also a COPD patiant. So far I am pleased with the results. I have been using samples from the doctor and sence has precribed  40 mg daily. If anything changes, I will re-rate the product. I am 56 years old and 230 lbs, I do not excersize and I dont diet. I work 10-12 hour days and drink 2-3 oz of bourban nightly. I know bad habit. My gole is to drop the weight so I dont have to take this. I have been suffering high BP for only 3 months. Hope this helps. ",5
"Two weeks on. 175/108 bp so just not working for me. My hopes were high, but back where I started. There has to be something...... ",1
I have been using this for two yrs and it works great. I now only take 10mg once a day and it seems to be leveling out but doctor should take me off in a few months. I have lost 30+ lbs and work out five days a week and will be 60 soon.....,5
Edarbi worked amazingly well to reduce my extremely high blood pressure and I have experienced zero side effects.  I would recomment anyone with high blood pressure to ask their doctor to try this treatment.,5
I have developed quite painful reynaud's syndrome since taking this drug and wonder if anyone else has. it is not listed as a side effect.,5
"this has been much better than my original Rx. unfortunately my insurance forces me to choose a different Rx - losartan - starting 1/1/14. never had a problem, and bp is at all time low.",5
"it lowered my blood pressure drastically, I have to reduce the dosage (80 mg) twice to achieve a reasonable BP (120/70)",5
"My Dr. gave me this medicine knowing full well I have renal stenosis and kidney stent. My BP shot up real figh, my heart was palpatating and more. I nearly was killed by this medicine. I am writing to the FDA about it!!!!",1
Very good For controling high blood pres. sure beatería tan Andy other medicine THAT i have taken,5
BP went from 165/110 to 128/88 within a week. A little light-headed but worth it v. high blood pressure. ,5
Taking Edarbi for 5 months.  I have have been light headed and dizzy most of the time.  The last few have had chronic diarrhea. I also have had trouble with BP becoming very low.  ,5
"Been on Edarbi 40mg. for 6 months.  I also take Bystolic 40mg. (max dosage)- together, these do the trick.  One problem after about 16 hours in a 24 hour day, BP tends to go from: 100/70 to 189/110.  Edarbi will indeed: (1) itchy skin & head like rash, (2) difficult with Heavy Breating (3) stomach churning (4) weakness in: hips, legs, back, arms (5) swelling in ankles and feet (6) a empty of bowel through out day (7) brain fog (8) minor cough like (Lisinopril) (9) weight gain like (Lyrica) (10) Erectile Dysfunction (Male).  NOTE: IF YOU CAN ONLY USE 40MG. (DO SO) EDARBI COMES IN 40MG. & 80MG.  Note:  Edarbi has alot of side effects, but over time depending on individual they will become less bothersome. This is the newest BP Medication on market currently.  USE WITH CAUTION !!",5
iat first it was the perfect med. now i just got out of the hospital due to a very low blood p reading 70 over 45. even though i reduce the dos to third . finally the hospital dr and other dr statd that this med dos indeed lower your blood pressure rating too muich. the only one refuseaccept the fact is the heart Dr. he dos not get it he want to keep saling and promoting this new med. i spend two day at the hospital because of this med lower the heart blood pressure all sudden withourt any warninig,4
At first BP went down then you could not tell a big difference.  She starting having chest pain.  She is also taking clonidine and the two together is just not bringing it down where it should be.  Other than the chest pain and tiredness no major issues.,4
"5’8 280lbs 42%bf.  Been using Edarbi 40mg for 6 months.(80mg cut in haft) Works just like its supposed too.. I do notice more urination but very clear, who knows this could be from the  bystolic 5mg, (10mg cut in haft) I was started on both at the same time.  Had 145/100 blood pressure now I run about 124/73. If I would  try a better diet, and exercise I would not need either. Something I’ll work on right after this bag of chips and movie. I must say, nether pill helps with motivation.  ",4
"was taking another drug that wasn't working dr. added edarbi, started at 80mg, blood pressure dropped to low 90/60. cut dose in half to 40mg and dropped other drug. Pressure is great always around 120/80. But side effects for me are tiredness, brain fog and difficulty in concentration. sometimes short term memory loss. Dr thought maybe i have alzheimers. but symtoms go away when stop taking edarbi for a few days.  Doctors dont seem to want to believe that side effects are a problem. going to keep taking until i see a new cardiologist .",5
"I am taking 40 mgs. of Edarbi and have reduced it to one tab every other day, as one a day was causing some dizziness and fatigue. The current program is effective and effects are more tolerable.  I check pressure regularly and this dose is doing the job. Doctor okayed this.",5
immediately lowered bp no side efects                  ,5
Three weeks on edarbi 40. BP went down immediately. Unfortunately I have developed a very dry cough and rash over my face and throat. I will call my doctor tomorrow. It worked so well I hope there is a remedy.,5
"been on it for 2 months 80 mg ,I have expiriance  dizzines  when getting up , fatige when barely doing any type of activity such as going  up stairs. chest disconfort  (asthma like sensation) to the point that i will go see the doct tomorrow it feels like angina from what i beeen told. I'm scare. My blood pressure is excellent now no other pill ever worked but i dont know if what im feeling is a side effect. Im 5.8 tall and 160 lbs  my cholesterol is high and I do take cholesterol pills too. ",5
does not seem to make a difference,2
190/98 start on for a year always around 119/79. No complications. Easy to use drug. Benicar HCT and Micardis did not touch my BP. Caremark covers it I pay next to nothing for this drug.,5
"I have had high blood pressure for 15 years.  I am petite, I exercise 3 - 4 times a week and I eat a healthy diet. I have tried every family of BP medicine, and they all seem to have side effects. My goal is to find the medicine that has the least side effects and keeps my BP down. I have been taking Edarbi for 4 months. I take a 1/4 of a tablet and my BP readings are very good, sometimes too low which has never happened in the past. Side effects are muscle pain (primarily in my hands and wrists), weight gain(approximatley 8 - 10 pounds), and intense hot flashes. These side effects are minimal compared to other BP drugs so I will do my best to stay on this medicine. ",5
Been on for a year. Lowest blood pressure in three years. First few months experenced dizziness but that passed. Am currently having muscle spasms in upper arms and joint pain in the hip area. Also having trouble with pain while walking.  Having my annual physical in three weeks will talk to doctor about spasms and joint pain.    ,5
Blood pressure dropped from 171/99 to 103/66 in a matter of days. Only two problems (1) insurance won't cover it once the free samples run out (2) it gives me the weirdest dreams (not scary just oddball),5
Severe stomach issues and muscle spasms.,1
"just started, has reduced my BP markedly better than Micardis",5
just started medication after 48 hours of 40mg /day  avg of eight BP readings per day  109 systolic/52 diastolic w/pulse at 55bpm,4
"Light headed, black out when I stand up too fast. Muscle spasms.",3
"I use no drugs except for high BP. I have tried most of the ones on the market, side effects of rashes, cough, muscle spasms, blurred vision.  During 8 weeks without ANY BP drugs, my BP ranged 135/65 - 180/80 and I felt great. After 4 wks Edarbi 40m, BP now ranges from 170/90 to 116/50 within minutes. Frequent hot flushes, diarrhea, muscle aches, dizziness, very diminished sense of smell and taste, and fatigue.  Not happy with this one, either.",2
"I have been on edarbi for about 8-9 months. It really brought my BP down..sometimes too low,but started a hacky cough,feeling of vomiting, muscle spasms that were awful,painful joints,weakness,very tired,cough getting out of hand,and not tolerable.Urination weakness,and all around feeling awful. Medicare won't pay for it either. ",3
the problem is it only comes with 80 mg it should have lower dos. most of the time my blood pressure droped too much so i had to cut the bill in a half. at first has sever mussel weaknes and spasm now most of it it gone. also the other problem is that medicare dos not accept this medication so i had to keep getting samples from the dr,4
"I have been on edarbi 80mg for about 3 weeks it has lowered my blood pressure but it also cause me to have severe muscle pain in my chest and back so much I couldn't hardly breath, as a result I have had to come off the medication because the pain was unbareable....",5
"Passing fecal matter multiple times per day, including it leaking out.  Several times each week the diarrhea would explode from my body with little advance warning. resulting in major bathroom clean-ups.  Gained fifteen pounds in the four months on it; ravenously hungtry/Persistent cough.",4
my diastolic was always in the low 90s.  edarbi has been the prescription to help.  now my number in in the low 70s. i am so happy with this medication,4
Experienced severe dizziness and no lowering of blood pressure. Also muscle and joint pain on first day.,1
"I'm considered a petite female and my BP has always been 120/80. After age 45 my BP started to rise and stayed around 140/90, even with proper weight, exercise and diet.  Now, after 2 months my BP is around 115/73.  I feel much better these days.",5
Not much change with BP . Coused a problem with erectile function .Contacting the Dr. today to change to another med.,2
Has not lower my blood pressure and causes chronic constipation.,1
"This medication was given to me by my Primary Care physician  and had taken it for about three months. At first it controlled my BP and shortly threafter I began experiencing headaches, developed body rashes and finally urine retention. He thinks I should continue taking it and I refused to to do so. I had to be straight cath in the ER and must now followup with a Urologist.",2
"I've been on Edarbi 40mg tabs for almost 2 weeks,my BP is still not stable,sometimes dropping to 99/66,also my stomach has been cramping as if I need have a bowel movement or the feeling that I might have diarrhea.The doctor said to stay on the med. ",3
"one a day, easy    no side effects",5
"My Dr switched me from Benicar HCT to Edarbi a week ago.  So far, so good.  No side effects and BP is perfect.",5
"Ithought Amlodipine was the worst pill I had ever taken for High blood pressure until I took Edarbiclor.  Amlodipine just made my legs swell up as big as an elephant's and my hair fall out, but Edarbiclor, which I thought was going to work well on lowering my blood pressure, made me have an irreglar, very fast heartbeat and my blood pressure rise to 225/110 and I spent the night in the hospital where they finally got my blood pressure down and my diastolic reading was down to 35. They put me on Valsartan and I did very well on it... till they recalled it and now I can't find anything that really keeps it down.  I am on Hydralzine, 3 of them three times a day. Still looking for something that works but have been messed up ever since taking Edarbyclor.",1
I've taken this for about 8 months and had bad side effects. Never again!,2
"Switched because hyzaar was having decreased effect. First week results were volatile. Be careful, as my bp fluctuated from 140/100 down to 70/60. Stabilized eventually. I later decreased to 40/12.5 as the diuretic was too strong and my bp was too often coming out low and I was dizzy when first standing. Even at the lower dose I sometimes am. Working on losing weight now to go back to Hyzaar as this stuff is more expensive ($100 for 3 months compared to $4 for 3 months of generic hyzaar). I also think in general I felt better when I was taking only hyzaar, so if I can lose weight I'd rather take it. ",4
"This medication has given me extreme stomach pain, weakness and body pain, Now they say after being off it for three days . Maybe gallbladder, strange! I didnâ??t have any problems before I started edarbylor 40/25 , doctor also said not due to medication, I find that strange I have not taken any of this crap since Monday, today being Thursday blood pressure 115 / 63 pulse 76 with no meds since Monday : BP great with no other meds. Appears it still is in my system . ",1
"I have very stubborn high blood pressure. I have tried Benicar, AZOR, lisinopril, losartan, valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide, Plus others. Blood pressure is 170/110 without meds. About 140/90 with above. With Edarbyclor and Bystolic it is 130/80. Finally under control! ",5
No side effects and excellent results.,5
"I was diagnosed with stage II hypertension since 1992. It was stubborn and just would not reduce despite having so many medications prescribed over the years I have lost count. My BP was average 186/118, with high creatinine level and poor GFR. I am 71 years, prognosis not good! I was prescribed Edarbyclor six months ago, my BP is now 135/90 with much improved creatinine and GFR readings. The only noticeable side effect for me has been slight constipation. which has been easy to deal with. Edarbyclor for me has been a magical fix for my hypertension. I can see fro many other comments on this post that it does not suit everyone. My experience with hypertension drugs over 25 years has been awful for side effects of so many prescribed drugs. I feel fortunate to have found a drug that significantly reduces my BP and improves kidney function, I was cynical about prescribed drugs for years and had almost given up with it all.",5
"This was administered in an emergency situation form a sample package in my doctor's office as my blood pressure was taken at 190/100 after 30 minutes my pressure steadily declined and leveled off at 140/80.  This was a miracle! I have a history of HBP, STROKES, DIABETES and M.S, allergies galore nothing has EVER controlled my HBP with the help of Metoprolol Tartrate",5
"I have stubborn high BP.  Doctor switched me from Valsartan & HTZ to Edarbyclor 40/25 mg.(He described this as similar modes of action and slightly stronger).  3 weeks later, BP has gone down a little.  So far so good.  Maybe some tiredness (not that I read all the other comments)...I'll see how that goes.",4
"Doc replaced Valsartan with this drug.  Took 1 pill in the morning along with other BP meds.  At 6pm I was incoherent, fainty, wobbly legs and my fingers were tingling.  I took no more!",1
Have been taking Toprol XL and not the generic for over 10 years. Take 100 mg in morning and 100 mg in evening. BP went up to 198/105 this past wed. and went to ER. Then was told to see my primary doc within 2 days. She put me on edarbyclor 40 mg cut in half and take in morning rather than my Toprol. Big mistake since I can't take diuretics. It kept me from peeing. Also had many other horrible side effects. Went back to my usual dose of Toprol XL and feeling better already. Calling doc tomorrow. Took this awful new drug for only two days.,1
I was taking up to 100mg of Metoprolol a day and it did NOTHING. Tried Lisinopril and Amlodapine; nothing but nasty side effects.  Started Edarbyclor and my BP came down withing days. You really need to give it two weeks. My BP before Edarbyclor peaked as high as 199/100. Now it's typically 125/80. I don't notice the side effects others mention.,5
"Always had low blood pressure. Got extremely sick, blood pressure was 244/166. Went to emergency room was giving a shot and pill and sent home. Family doctor seen the next day in stage three kidney failure. Was taking 5 different  a day eleven times. Brought it down, but was consuming my life. Was put on edarbyclor and bystolic pressure is now 106/64. Do have the muscle weakness bad. And heart doing that hard flop feeling.",5
"This medication is terrible. After two days, I felt muscle weakness, heart palpatations, extreme dizziness (the worst side affect). This morning my BP reading was very high,  225/95, and I just doubled up on my old medication to bring it down. I already feel 100% better than when I took the edarbyclor. I'm currently on Metoprol 25mg twice a day. Maybe all I need is to increase that dose. Seeing doctor tomorrow for another consultation and will return the free samples to him.",1
Side effects,4
"it brought my BP down but i have muscle weakness and tiredness.  i have muscle pain in my arms, mostly my left arm to where i cannot raise my arm up to comb my hair.  Basically i am losing use of my right arm.  Doctor says it can't be edarbyclor, but it happen right after taking edarbyclor, low dosage. But it is the only drug that lowered my BP.  what to do??",4
I hurt in my sides and stomach .. Tired  really out of breath could not hardly function .. Now doctor said I my have to have a liver transplant .. And this came on very sudden .. Don't know if the medication had any thing to do with it but it was very close togather,1
"Dr. gave me some free samples, which are not easy to open. It worked, but too well. My BP dropped very low on 3rd day of use. 2nd day of use I started having some leg cramps and clammy sweating after light activity. 3rd day, by evening, clammy sweating was much worse, dizzy, short of breath, chest pains and vomiting. BP dropped to 98/68. Took all night for chest pains to go away. Now I'm on day one of a new medication so we'll see how it goes.",3
I have a lot of joint pain or muscle pain and I think that is one of the side effects of taken this pill...,1
This pill brought down my blood pressure drasticly within a few days to 105 over 61.  Made a believer out of me.,5
"Been on numerous BP meds in the last six months. this one actually lowered BP-average 108/65, too much 88/46 at times. Constant light headedness, short of breath and back pain in left hip/lower abdomen. Can't work while on this medication. Very frustrated that I can't function on a normal basis every day and I've been off work since taking this drug. ",5
BP before was running 180/110 on the 3rd day I nearly died as a result of this medication. Was rushed to ER via EMS with NO BP and my heart rate had dropped to 30's. It's been a week and still remain dizzy with heart palpitations and heart damage. I am a 20 year Paramedic and WOULD NOT recommend this drug. It's too powerful and that's on the starting dose.,5
Lowered my BP fast and soon became too low. Constant feeling of fatigue and extreme muscle weakness even after cutting dose in half. ,4
"Lowered bp too much, 85/54 cut dosage by 1/2.  Still dips too low and waves of pure exhaustion.  Lie down or fall down feeling.",5
"On three different occasions my blood pressure has dropped to 90/60 twice and 90/50 once. I passed out on one occasion when I stood and walked a few feet.  As you can see, it has lowered my blood pressure.",2
"it lowered my pressure to 95 over 63 I was extremely ill while taken it,muscle and joint pain extreme fatigue,was taken off it right away,made me ill.",1
"Worked right away to get my BP down for surgery and I have no problems with side effects. Highly recommend it, but I think in the new year my insurance probably won't cover it.....bummer",5
"My doctor changed my blood pressure medication to edarbyclor 40mg/25 mg. First day after taking it in am had severe headache, felt extremely weak, blood pressure borderline high. Second day, severe headache, extreme weakness, near syncope, blood pressure 198/110, heart rate 75, blood sugar is 276. Stopped taking this med after second day. called my doctor. went back to my regular medication. still weak, headaches, elevated blood sugar, borderline high blood pressure after third day. ",1
Decreased blood pressure & heart rate. Heart rate seems to be reduced too low. I am also on diabetes medication and not sure if these 2 things mix.,4
"First I developed cramps legs & hands then my toe got swollen,had an exray and determine it was caused by a tear so it is now wrapped and takes 7 mos. to repair. Noticed in side affects, toe is mentioned. I'm going off this medication.....",1
Fatigue feeling,4
After taking this med for 9 days it has lowered my BP too low and I always feel lightheaded/dizzy just doing the easiest task. I also have shortness of breath just walking 50 feet and rapid heart rate. I stopped this med today and will see my Dr. on Monday to change BP meds.,3
"been on edarbyclor one month. Fatigue, light headed, constant nausea. Has lowered my BP, but have high heart rate.",5
This drug is effective in lowering BP but the side effects are too much.  Have been on the drug for 5 months. Excessive tiredness and gas bloating and joint pain.  Will return to the Dr. next week to be taken of the drug.,4
Having diarrhea also blood pressure too low,3
"Lowered B-P, but have had side-effects: swollen feet and ankles, and weight gain. Would not use again",3
"BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN BUT THE BACK PAIN ,SHOTNESS OF BREATH AND LACK OF ENERGY JUST ISN'T WORTH IT CAN'T WALK 200 YARDS WITHOUT SHOTNESS OF BREATH",2
"I have been on Edarbyclor for 4-5 weeks and at first it work really well brought my Bp down, but now my Bp is too low.Yesterday it was 96/49 and stays low. I stay dizzy, sick to my stomach, very tired, short of breath, & ache all over. I don't feel like doing anything anymore which is not like me. I've called my Doctor and waiting to talk to him about this & see if we can try something different.",3
"I have a rare renal artery disease called fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries which results in hypertension which is resistant to treatment. After three renal angioplasties and a right renal stent, I was on 8 antihypertensive medications when I had a reaction to Lisinopril (angioedema of the lip/face). My physician ordered Edarbyclor 40 Mgm/12.5 and continued Clonodine 0.2 Mgm patches (2) weekly, Tekturna 300 Mgm Daily, Norvasc 10 Mgm Daily, Toprol Xl 100 Mgm BID and after 45 days, I have a stable BP. The side effects are some intestinal cramps,gas, fatigue but well worth it for me. I already have nephrosclerosis so can not afford to have an uncontrolled BP. At least my kidney function will remain stable instead of deteriorating. I praise Takeda for putting this drug on the market! It has given me a chance to live and enjoy the time that I have left.",5
Taking meds for one month. Helped B/P levels.Now I have upper back pain and shortness of breathe. High heart rate as well.,4
"On 2nd day of taking Edarbyclor 40/25mg. I experience a extremely painful cramp in upper thigh, dizziness, felt faint, fast heart beat, trouble breathing, cold sweat, very weak. BP was 100/46. Went to Dr. next day and was told just a leg cramp and BP went low because of trying to stand up, to stay on med. Got diarrhea, stomach cramps, dizziness, then on 5th day got bad pain in right side of chest and back, got so severe went across my chest. thought maybe I had a fractured rib, pain was so bad. Stopped taking Edarbyclor on Tuesday, by Wed. pain in chest better but then I woke up with a very bad cramp in the right uppper thigh. Meanwhile, my BP is all over the place because I monitor twice a day. As I read the literature, Dr. shouldn't have started me on higher dose, but at this point I will not take it again. It may lower your BP but the side effects are to many and definately interferred with my quality of life.",5
"Been on several BP meds with limited success.  Was on Edarby 80 and Bystolic 10, minimal success, but BP 164/90, flush in face, some confusion.  Switched to Edarbychlor, no side effects and BP is 115/74, lost weight and feel great.  I am in excellent shape for any age, weight lift, run, bike, swim 4-6 days a week, eat right, getting 8-10 hours sleep a night all part of the program.  All my family has BP issues, parents, cousins, aunts, all over 48 are experiencing same BP issues.  So far very pleased with drug.  Dropped from 254 to 227, hope to drop to 215 and maybe reduce dosage.  Doc showed me my history of visits and BP changes over 8 year period.  In 2004 at 215 no problems, 2008 at 230 BP OK but more other issues, all minor.  2010 hit 254 (bulking up and too much belly fat) 180/115, many sinus infections then surgery and BP never went down without meds.  Tried several and finally this seems to be working. No tiredness, weakness etc.  Ran 4 miles the weight trained for 1 hour this am, felt great all day.",5
Have had constipation since taking,3
"I have been on this medication for two weeks.  This medication has brought my blood pressure down I think two far.  I have had back pain and my heart has been skipping beats, also sometimes racing.  Very Very Dizzy.  It's like I can't stand up without falling at least once a day.  I am taking myself off this medication and trying something new.",5
This was my fourth BP med. After being on this one for two weeks had to call Dr. because BP was running 88/64 the highest was 114/80. Felt tired and dizzy most of the time. The only good thing has been weight loss.Dr decided to switch me to Edarbi. Start that on Monday. Hope it works without side effects.,4
"Intestinal pain (gas) is not a listed side effect, but should be",3
Stomach problems and breathing difficulties at times. BP moderately controlled .,3
"Have been taking this medication for about a month. Works very good at lowering the BP.  However, BP sometimes very low.  Sometimes get lightheaded.  When BP is low i.e, 90/54 don't know whether or not to take the next dose,and that a problem for me. I plan to talk to the Dr. about this.",5
Being overweight 290 and out of shape i needed something to lower my bp.  My blood pressure was lowered and I did feel faint.  I suspect that this is to be expected for a drug that lowers blood pressure.  No problems except that the cost at 109 per month is way too high.,5
"Decreases blood pessure, but on the second day of taking this medication during my regular half mile walk I experienced chest pain, tachycardia and feeling that I do not have the energy to walk further. I stopped taking this medication and back to previous meds (Diovan).",4
"I've been on the medication for about 3 weeks,ihave notice that I have been very sleepy and tired.",3
I have been on this med. for one week...I am so tired ..that is not like me at all...I have a cough...low heart rate...shortness of breath..and heavyness in my chest...I am going back to my Dr. tomorrow...to hve Med. changed...,5
"The first 2 weeks on this med all seemed okay. But then all the negatives started to appear. Specifically dizziness, aching body areas and feeling totally fatigued at times. Never had experienced any of these problems prior to taking this medication. I am a very active 73 year old. It has lowered my blood pressure but has increased my heart rate a fact I know because I monitor my pressure.",5
"Although the med brought my BP down very quickly, after just a few days on the med, I started having severe upper back pain after doing simple everyday chores.  It became so bad that I didn't want to do anything but rest.  Over the last several days, I have begun having muscle spasams at night in up upper thigh and continual leg cramps which began in the thighs and moved also into the calves of both legs.  I have been on the meds for two weeks, but discontinued using it today.  ",3
Effective but side effects including stomach cramps,4
Ive been taking this med for 2 months now after trying 3 diff. BP meds and this is the only one that I havent had any side effects with until now. Its not controlling my BP anymore :( Sad Im back to numerous Dr vitits.  ,5
OK for 5 days. As effective as Diovan-HCT. Adverse reaction on 6th day after having an alcholic drink.,4
"From the  beginning, I had an upset stomach along with severe diarhea.  It happened for 5 straight days and finally asked the Dr. to take me off it.",2
"it works great to control my bp, but it leaves me very tired. i can work a couple of hours and then i have no energy. ",5
"This is the first med that actually helped my blood pressure after trying two others but the side affects are terrible. I took this medication for 7 days and started having bad upper back pain whenever I did any kind of work. At 14 days the pain was severe and nearly constant. I also started feeling light headed every time I got out of a chair. I stopped the medication and symtoms went away in 5 days. I stayed off the medication for 10 days and restarted. In five days the back pain, light headedness were back as bad as before. On the second round I was becoming very irritable over very minor things. As I said earlier the medication did wonders for my blood pressure but completely ruined my quallity of life.",5
I have been on edarbyclor for 10 weeks and it has controlled my bp wonderfully but the side effects have been very bad. Extreme dizziness and lightheaded Feeling as well as a very fast heart rate. ,5
Was very pleased with this drug at first.  My blood pressure was good but after being on it for almost 3 months I started having severe shortness of breath and severe back pain.  I couldn't walk from the kitchen to the bedroom without shortness of breath. The pain in my upper back made it hard for me to do any outside work.,5
"SInce taking the drug, rapid heart rate and back pain",3
"It took me about a month to adjust to the initial onset of the side effects (dizziness). After that my BP settled to 130/70. My palpitations stopped within a week of starting Diltiazem, tinnitus went away, anxiety somewhat under control. I lost weight and in general felt better than before. My advice is do not drive a vehicle for 2 weeks when starting this medication.",5
"38 year old male, taking for AF, PAC, and SVT. Started out with 120mg, then 180mg, then 240mg. Every time the dose was upped my heart went crazy. Arrhythmias are as bad as they've ever been. Also quite constipated despite a high-fiber diet. For me this drug just doesn't work.",1

I have been on Enalapril for more than 10 years. I started out on 10 mg. once per day and found that by evening my BP had gone up.  Changed dosage to 10mg. twice a day.  Later changed to 15 mg twice a day and have been there for years with very good results.  It works for me and I have not experienced any side affects at all.,5
" I took this med. for two months.Bad cough, dizzy when I stood up, headache, couldn't sleep,and dry mouth like know other were side effects I had! BP was low and consistently low! Side effects were bad for me, but it did its job on lowering BP. ",2
"I've taken this medication for about 3 months now.  I had a bit of coughing at first, but just a bit.  My biggest concern is that my mid-section seems to be puffing out.  I've not gained weight but have gained inches.  Anyone else having this problem?",3
"I only took 5 mg. for less than two week.  I was extremely spaced out mentally, very fatigued and felt like I was intoxicated.  It did keep my blood pressure very low but I stopped taking it on my own because I did not feel like myself and didn't trust my judgement on this drug.  ",5
"I just started this medication  1 week change from hydrochlorothiazide to enalapril 2.5 mg because it cause hives and numbness both arms and hands and knee pain, severe headaches. So far its doing really good went from 150/96 to 106/76 ",5
"Started using enalapril because of my horrible experience with amlodipine. For the first few weeks this drug was awesome. Low to normal bp, no side effects. After two weeks I was not able to sleep because of the dry cough. Kept getting worse until I just couldn't stand losing nay more sleep. Went off it after about 5 months. ",2
"This medication works well to lower my blood pressure. Prior to this I was taking labetalol and amlodipine, it was difficult to maintain a normal blood pressure with those too, the best I was able to accomplish was a low-high blood (159-160/89-90)pressure.  This medication helps me achieve a more normal pressure.  ",5

"Severe coughing.I was taking this in 2011 and was coughing so bad chest and stomach hurt. one day my mother-in-law asked meds that i was  taking and suggested i look up side effects, and i did check out the enalapril and saw coughing as a side effect.

I plan to discuss with Dr. this week.  I have been on this med before, but not very long and not with these issues.  Also, I experience slight dizziness and pressure in head.  It's like I have been up about 14 hours and had only 2-3 hours of sleep.  I also urinate about every 2-3 hrs. at nite, which causes sleep interruption.  I also drink a lot of water; therefore may lie the explanation of getting up a lot at night.  When under stress, the medication doesn't seem to help very much.  My BP is still high-like 154/95.  I have tried several medicines and will keep hoping I'll find one that works for me.  ",1

"brand name drug is more effective in treating high blood pressure than the generic, however  now with the price of durgs being so high, have decided to try the generic.  I will give it 2 mo. to be effective, if not I will switch back to the brand name.  The mfg. of this will not even talk of price reduction after talking to them. Luckily I am able to afford this drug, but when Medicare or other companies make you pay over $300.00 for 60 pill (1 mo. worth), you have to question their belief in this product. Take other pills for H.B. also in conjuction with this to make sure my blood pressure is within the normal standards, but it is hard.  Why so much $ for these pills when they have been on the market for over 25 years?  Are they more concerned with their product or with the consumer with an inherited disease that needs treatment.  Again will try this for 2 mo. and hopefully it will do what it says-lower ones high blood pressure.",2

His Dr told him it would lower his bp within the first week (!) He's experiencing nausea and fatigue since he's been taking this-I saw that it was listed as a common side effect.  Anyone else feeling like this? Any hints on what he can do diff to help d/c the side effects? I was thinking that he could take it at night--the pharmacist said that it's important to take at the same time each day but that it didn't matter what time of day.

However, my bp isn't quite as low as I'd like so have now added another quarter tablet and the pain is back.

Went to Atacand, too expensive for me even with insurance. Onto Carvedilol 6.25. Didn't like this at all, caused what I call ""scalp pain"". Came to find out, this is caused by blood pressure droping. Carvedilol also caused my blood sugar drop. Now am back to the family of Lisinopril, am curious to see if Enalapril causes the same problem with coughing.",3

"After taking Enalapril 20 mg once a day for about three years after being switched from another Ace inhibior, due to the dry non-productive cough, my doctor increased my doage to one 20 mg. twice a day.  About two to three months later I began to experience  terrible flatulence, but worse of all I had a change in my bowels and consequently changed my diet to include more fiber without over doing it.  The situation got  increasingly worse and I was not getting any help from my primary care physician who suggested with scare tactics that I needed to eliminated the possibility of cancer, which OF COURSE I did almost immediately. On two separate occasions-one before the  colonoscopy and one post, I stopped taking the Enalapril, then the anti-inflammatory (prescribed after the colonoscopy).  On both occasions there was a marked difference.  The second time I remained off Enalapril and all the mucosa and fecal incontinence disappeared until I started another medication in the ARB category.  Needless to say I did not take it for too long; maybe six weeks before my bowels began to go for five to six days with no movement. Prior to the original malfunction mani- festation, my bowels would always move  thoroughly at least every other day, and sometimes two to three times a day.  I would NEVER go five days without a movement.  Now, as a I am writing about it in hope of helping another poor soul, I see why so many adult diapers are on the market.  Dr. William Prather wrote the article on a study of Enalapril at Harvard Medical School that gave me the courage to quit the blood pressure medication, but my blood pressure is far, far from normal EVERY DAY. And I have to say that I feel  better that I can eliminate normally, but I know my blood pressure needs down from 170/90.  Is there any hope for me knowing  that I can not tolerate Ace Inhibitors or ARB's.  Please Help Me (before I suffer too much damage)  BJW  ",2

"What started as atypical high blood pressure has revealed itself to be hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone) which causes hypokalemia (low potassium) which causes hypertension (high blood pressure). After a few years of doctors trying different combinations of blood pressure meds, an endocrinologist diagnosed the hyperaldosteronism. I initially began taking Spironolactone to treat but after a few weeks I began experiencing breast pain and noting breast enlargement (Gynocomastia). My doctor switched me to Eplerenone which is supposed to equally effective, but without that particular side effect. The breast issue went away and my potassium levels have stabilized into a normal range. My BP continues to be marginally high at times, but I think other factors will need to be improved (like my weight) to get over the hump. Overall, I am pleased to date, but another users previous review about kidney disease after 5 years of this medication have me greatly concerned. The endocrinologist says the need to regulate my aldosterone with medication will be for the rest of my life, so I will be raising the subject of long term risks.",3
"Primary hyperaldosteronism. Prescribed by a nephrologist,  seemingly perfect drug for this condition.  BP improved significantly but after 5 years taking it,  I am in  stage 4 kidney disease,  which is irreversible. Be wary. Nephrologist happily will push you into dialysis and end your life as you know it. Be watchful for this dreadful side effect,  educate yourself about CKD and consider your options.",3
I had chronic high blood pressure for many years. I tried every usual medication available with little positive effect. Eplerenone dropped my blood pressure to a normal level in three days and I was able to reduce or drop most of my other medications.,5
"I jusst started on the drug two weeks ago and it has raised my KI levels back in the normal range.  I started intestinal bleeding today , cause unknown, I was trying to research the side effects of this rug.",4
I have been taking Spironolactone for several years but I began noting breast enlargement (Gynocomastia).  My doctor put me Eplerenone which is supposed to be a more effective drug for the type of hypertension that I have.  The literature says it may take up to 4 weeks for the full effects of the drug to start working.  I closing out my 3rd week on Eplerenone and my BP is still not stable.  In fact I had to go to the ER several weeks ago after experiencing a very high reading  I've got my fingers crossed that it will eventually fully kick-in.,2
"I took this to help regulate my potassium only.  It may have worked, but not without lots of problems and I had to go off of it after two months.  My problems were serious jaw pain to the point where I was involontarily crying.  Also, began to get confused and just overall suffering.  Took myself off it and returned to my potassium supplements.",1

"Horrible medication. Did not work. Do not think this should ever be rx'ed as a long term treatment. I had been taking this as part of a combo pill with lisinopril (lisinopril 20 mg-hctz 12.5mg) for >4 years for my essential hypertension. It took me that long to figure out what was the culprit of all of my side effects: ringing in ears/slight hearing loss, dry mouth, get up to urinate 5x a night, increased hunger...never felt full, increased thirst, fatigue, increased weight gain (from 123lbs to 132lbs, I'm 5""7 and 30 yrs old) that I could not drop for the life of me with intense exercise 6-7 days/week and eating healthy/counting calories. Have been off of it for only 3 1/2 weeks, all of my side effects have started to subside, I actually feel full after eating/have decreased appetite, down -5 lbs, and my BP is controlled with lisinopril alone. Drs. RX these meds like it is candy without fully informing patients about all the negatives. Through my own research I have found HCTZ has been criticized for being overprescribed as there are no studies that show it actually helps prevent stroke/heart attack ",1
"After taking Effexor/venlafaxine for over 10 years for my anxiety and depression, the medication made me go from borderline low blood pressure my entire life to extremely high blood pressure consistently for five months. At first, we, my doctor and I figured it was anxiety related but I started monitoring at home as well. He was reluctant to go right into bp meds so started with the hydro first, right away I was back to great numbers. I'm not sure how a water pill can cause so many side effects as being reported in the reviews, some allergic reactions I of course get. I just made sure to intake appropriate fluids, not coffee and or soda all day, lots of water and juices. I of course used the bathroom more often and also made the clearly stated necessary adjusts to my diet as well to accommodate the vitamin K and potassium. So I personally did not experience much of any issues, a couple leg cramps while sleeping, when my potassium intake went low. But for the most part this did great and added bonus, I take thyroid meds that make my ankles swell and it took care of that issue as well. I feel bad that there are doctors out there who are not thorough and do not do their dodillagence, however I'm quite lucky my doctor enjoys to learn, research and educate. Me having an anxiety disorder I'm on top of my health care and make sure to ask for what I need. ",5
"Since starting this med (12.5mg) along with Amlodipine, my BP has lowered. However, I am experiencing cramping in my leg muscles, dry mouth and occasional headache. I have only been taking it for 2 weeks. So, I am giving it some time. ",2
"I was taking this med for about 4 years. At first I started having anxiety attacks. Still have them now but not as bad. For the last couple of years I've had tingling in my arms, feet ",1
"It worked well to lower my blood pressure, and I actually lost 15 pounds. However, It has many side effects. I have lost my hair. I am SOOOO tired all the time. Walk around in a fog. My feet and hands hurts horrible. For some reason my right elbow hurts really bad and I can barely bend it. My eyes are red all the time and my eye sight has gotten worse. Doctor never said anything about taking extra potassium. Have a constant headache.  I stopped taking it and hope that the symptoms will go away. I had none of these symptoms before taking this drug. Also, I am allergic to penicillin and you are not supposed to take this if you are allergic. So my doctor needless to say did not do his job of filling me in on the side effects and reactions to this medication. Not a good drug. My mother was also on it and she was a mess until we took her off of it and now she is back to normal. It makes you fell like a zombie!",5
"Entering into the 4th week on this drug, I developed allergic reaction resulting in rash and mouth sores.  ",1
"I took this drug for 4 1/2 years and along with other drugs, it worked well.  Then I got my first gout flare up and 4 more within 3 months.  I was taken off of it along with spironolactone and started on amlodipine due to the gout flare up.  Not as effective but I'm giving it time.  I started with a rhuemotologist due to the gout and he immediately said that the hydrochlorothiazide was the root cause of the gout.  I now have to add allopurinol and colcrys to my medications to combat the gout.  I'm not happy at all that I wasn't told about this side effect.  The nephrologist who prescribed it for my bp didn't even want to take me off this drug when I got my first few flare ups.  My internist was the one who did.",5
" Started on 25 MG, not working bump 50 MG, still not working then added Benazepril.  Bp ok at home not great when at docs.  Started having blood glucose issues, restlessness,  tremors, and tachycardia. Doc refuses to take me off that med even though I show her evidence for all these symptoms . I'm also allergic to penicillin. Probably should not even be on this drug. So I made decision to go off it on my own everything but trimmers is gone. Explain that. Sometimes I hate doctors. ",1
"I started this drug at 25mg. First day is ok, but my bp still a little over 140/80. On the second day, my bp came down to about 120/80, but I started to have severe vertigo, extreme hot flashes, shortness of breath, fatigue and irregular heart beat. I cut the dosage to half, vertigo became dizziness, but the rest of the symptoms were still there. Called my doctor and got switched to lisinopril. Hope this drug is better.",5
The Dr. added this drug to the Losartan I am taking. Seems to be bringing my bp numbers down a bit more.,4
"Thank you all you users of this HBP med. I have been wondering what was going on with my body once I took it. Reading your reviews I found several incidents that mocked mine experiences. I have a big fight with my PCP coming up! I am allergic to penisilin (I don't know how to spell it You get the jist) and wondering why my face would swell and I would get shortness of breath suddenly and cramping toes, feet and hands!! Thank you so much for bringing this information to light. Now I have ammunition to fight with! Praise God, praise you all for your courage to speak out! I am not a test dummy or lab rat to be practiced on! I don't mind sharing a diagnosis with a student but these FDA approved sanctions...Got to go! YOU TRY THEM!! Thanks again. MET.",3
"Started taking this BP pill with another BP pill. First day of taking it made me flush, gave me a headache and raised my blood pressure. Second day I took this BP pill three hours later put me in the ER with TACHYCARDIA.I was so scared of stroking out or going into cardic arrest.It was 12.5 mg.",1
I took this drug in the past without incident. Multiple years later I was prescribed this drug within 20 minutes I became very ill. I was treated in ER. I had heart kidney and lung damage. At that time doctors did not think this drug caused this. I had High lactic acid level ekg showed MI. I was told I had sepsis. After recovering I again took this drug. The same thing happened. Both times I was in ICU and very ill. I was told this was an anaphylactic reaction. Docs had never seen this before. There is no documentation of this type of reaction. I take different meds now for my hypertension,1
"I was on it approximately 8 years.  I began having bloating, stomach pain and diarrhea.  I had several GI tests which were all negative.  I kept researching this drug and found out I shouldn't have been taking it because I am allergic to penicillin.  I kept going to my PCP and finally I asked him to take me off it.  He didn't want to but I insisted.  All my symptoms began going away within 24 hours.  I am really disappointed in my doctor and have suffered immensely from this drug.",4
Began Hydrochlorothiazide with Verapamil for BP treatment at age 39. Then Lisinopril was added at age 43 for my treatment. I have been very satisfied with the results and correction of my BP over the years with very minimal side effects. The only major side effect I have had is occasional light headedness when standing to quickly. Regular lab work has always been within range. Thank You!,5
Started with lisinopril and HCTZ separately. Developed heat flash/redness. Switched to combo pill. Lately BP risen. Told to double intake. Started to cramp. Told to increase K. Not sure if I want to take 25mg again. Will try more OJ first for K supplement.,4
"Was first put on 12.5 mg and a month later increased me to 25 mg which made my bp shoot up high, 165/118, along with a lot of muscle spasms, sweating, leg and feet cramps, tension headache from lower temple, across face, bridge of nose to the other lower temple, joint pain, extreme dry mouth and bad constipation. Ended up in the ER with bp of 165/118 and small amounts of blood came out of my nose. Enough to scare the crap out of me. This is my 4th hbp medicine and have been allergic to all 4 - every bp family of medicines. Am going to find an alternative medicine route to try.",1
"Drug is making me extremely weak and tired,been having some stomach cramps and slight vision issues,doctor wants me to keep taking it,but i'm going to take a holistic approach,just makes me pee a lot and my potassium is dropping to dangerous levels.

"Reading all the negative reviews had me worried before I started taking this (25m), but after a month I have to say its worked out great for me! Not only battling with high blood pressure at a young age (per dr), being anemic ",5
"I was on this for 6 months I started at 25mg and went up to 75mg thinking that my blood pressure would come down, it did but my potassium went down as well as my magnesium and sodium and I went from being healthy to chest pains and a cough I cant get rid of and my kidneys went all out of wack, with the medication which now  I am on nothing right now but potassium pills and still have this damn cough that wont go away, doctor is still monitoring me but I think that with all the side effects it just wrecked my lungs.

"Have been taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg for about five years.  I always take my Blood pressure to ensure myself that the medication is definitely required. The fluctuations in my blood pressure has presented grave concern for me, as well as my physician. I usually need the medication about three days out of a week. On a Monday, for instance, often have a BP of 102 over 77.  I do not take the Diuretic for obvious reasons.  The other medication prescribed is Furosemide 25mg, twice daily. One of my prime difficulties are severe swelling of my legs which radiates to the ankles and feet. When this occurs my BP is always high (140/90 to 170/92. Within an hour of taking the medication my BP is within normal limits. I take a Potassium supplement, 20meq, one tablet each day that I take the diuretics.  Over a period of weeks I have developed three Urinary Tract Infections, treated with antibiotic each time controlled and  cured the difficulty. A Urinalysis was performed at the Dr.'s office revealing Hematuria. Had a kidney/ Bladder Ultrasound about three weeks ago.  Have not received my results as yet.  The concern I have is whether the Diuretics prescribed several years ago could have caused some damage to the Kidneys or Bladder. However, Hypertension if left untreated could be the causative factor.  ",5
"I had been taking this med for almost 12 years along with atenolol. Over the past 2 years, I started having aching joints. Then more recently started having gout attacks. Note that gout can be exacerbated by diuretics. Doctor moved me to another drug, but blood pressure is way up. ",5
B P stays at 171/80 ,2
I've been taking this water pill for several years at least. The only problem I've noticed is leg cramps once in a great while. I do eat a banana every day and have 250mg of magnesium (for migraine). I think I get leg cramps because I tend to not drink enough fluid.,4
it's a diuretic and dr didn't prescribe potassium--almost had coronary--on potassium now but can't get it regulated.  have no side effects other than this.  seeing if other bp meds can work without side effects but browsing internet shows none.  maybe answer is doubled potassium on daily basis with blood test every month.,5

"Went to the doctor for migraines and my pressure was 190/152. He started me on this as well as some pain meds for the migraines. The first week while taking this,I was vomiting and did not feel well AT ALL. I went back and he told me my body was just adjusting to the medicine and that it had to get use t having normal blood pressure. Its been about a month and I feel a lot better. My pressure is normal,but I do pee a lot more than I use to. Migraines are still terrible,hoping I can get something for them SOON.",5
"Hydrochlorothiazide worked great for 6-8 mos. dosage: 25 mg once daily and 10 MEQ Potassium CL daily. Potassium level too low, Dr. Increased Potassium CL to 20 MEQ daily, for two weeks, Potassium level 3.3, now changed to 12.5 mg Hydrochlorothiazide and 20 MEQ Potassium for two weeks. Be sure to keep a check on Potassium Levels.",5

I was having such mental confusion that I had to have my grandson drive for me and help me. My sodium got down to 124 before the doctor said that it was the Hydroclorothiazide. I have been recovering my mental health, but my blood pressure is up to 175/95 and my feet, legs and fingers are swelling. No solution to these problems offered yet.",3

To counteract the depletion of necessary nutrients when taking this drug I  take a 90mg Potassium and 400mg Magnesium supplements and try to eat potassium loaded bananas. I've had NO side effects, only did when dose was increased to 25MG and went back to 12.4MG. I'm grateful to say it's the only prescription drug I take.

"I have had low potassium. Put me in the ER once. Have had dizziness, light headness, tired, no energy, now I have numbness in my face and tounge. I have been to ENT, neurologist, cardiologist, chiropractor, family doctor,and endocrinologist. all blame it on diabetes. Except I have pre diabetic numbers. No one ever mention I might be having side effects from HCTC. The comments I have read fit my symptoms. Except the numbness in my face and burning tounge. My cardiologist just told me to quit taking HCTZ but did not say why. Now I know. Wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?",2
Since I have been on this medication I  am very dizzy blurred vision headaches and feet numbness and tingling. Been taking it for aboutfour months. Notice symptoms last couple of weeks. I  am going to take myself off to see if this medication is the problem. When taking several meds you have to figure out which is the problem. Plus hair loss also. ,5
"This drug at 25 mg dose did not alter my blood pressure any measurable amount whatsoever. After 1 month of use, my BP was still 150/100, no change. Worse, this drug caused severe constipation, excruciating gout-like symptoms, pounding heartbeat, elevated heat rate (always over 90/min, usually over 100/min)(Normal for me is 56 or so per minute), dry mouth, and severe,contant dehydration (it completly suppressed my thirst). I left the doctor who prescribed this poison, and found one who gave me something else. Would not recamend this to anyone.",1
My doctor prescribed this along with Lisinopril because of per-hypertenion and family history of HBP. When I take this medication it makes me sweat like I've run a marathon or something and all I am doing is sitting. I have trouble with swelling in my feet/ankles where it is to believed that I have neuropathy. I hate wearing drenched clothing so what can I do?,3

That bought my pressure down to 125/91. Thank you Lord!!!",1
"I have been taking this drug for 4 yrs now. Lately I had problems with walking. I would walk about 30 ft and it felt like I ran a marathon of 20 miles. Sometimes I could walk further and sometimes less. I went to Dr. , here I had very low potassium. He took the test that day and rushed it. Later that day he called me said he was calling in for 4 pills for me to take right away. I got them , he checked my potassium five days later with another blood test and said it was fine. I found out when a person is taking Dieredtic pills they need potassium subsatute. Well I was never perscribed one. I am not a doctor, u would think he would of perscribed one for me. He told me I can take the pills over the counter. must not of worked, cause now I can't walk. I am quitting the pillls today. I urinated all the time. Drinking Gatoraid2 and taking potassium pills over the counter. See if that works. Until I get back in to Dr. What a nightmare. How am I supose to take care of myself like this.

"The Dr. started me on 12.5 mg. It lowered my BP for a short time. He then increased my dose to 25 mg. My BP returned to normal. In 4 mo. I returned for a bi-annual check up and regular blood work. When I walked in the door at home my phone was ringing. The nurse said to go to the pharmacy immediately and get a prescription for Klorcon (potassium) and to stop the hydrochlorothiazide and to limit my fluid intake to 4 8oz cups a day including pudding, milk, juice,jello, gravy, etc. She said my potassium and my sodium was dangerously low! It took a few months to return to normal. Now my BP is high again.  While taking hydrochlorothiazide, my ankles swelled and I had a large amount of hair loss. I had to keep my hair covered while cooking or eating. I had to sweep my bathroom floor often to keep the hair cleaned up. I took my pill in the morning but still had to get up twice a night to go.",5
I never had symptoms of hbp until taking this drug. After so long after taking a dose I start to feel my blood pressure rise and I get a migraine.

The pill seemed to work at first but it gave me a bad headache and I felt dizzy. If I don't drink a TON of water all day long I feel intensely dehydrated. I'm constantly in the bathroom peeing which is very, very annoying. I will be talking to my doctor about getting off of this medication.",2
"I have never had a problem with cramping: legs, feet, extremely achey muscles until taking this pill.  Magnesium supplements helped but I was waking up at night.  After a blood test the doctor changed it to Lisinpril only and within a week, no more cramps and I felt better all over. Ran out of the Lisinpril only and took the combination for two days until I could get back to the pharmacy.  Big mistake!  I was again crampy and sore all over.  Took me a week to feel better.  I'll never take it again!  Now I'm warning others who complain of cramps.",1
I started taking this for temporary high blood pressure while under a lot of stress.  It worked immediately after the 1st dose.  It dropped my blood pressure so fast that it made me dizzy but once I found that balance and kept my diet low sodium it worked great and I ended up losing 10 lbs (a nice little bonus).,5

"I'm taking this for borderline H.B.P. In one week I've lost 9 lbs. (great) I have been experiencing more dizziness, some fatigue, and decreased sexual ability. I live in Fl. so its impossible to limit your exposure to the sun; I'm also sweating more than usual. I'll continue to take it if this is just the break-in period or drinking more water or mineral enhanced drinks help. I can always use Viagra to combat the loss of erection.

"I have taken HCTZ for 3-5 years. I don't know if it is the only cause, or not. But,I think it is a safe bet that it contributed to it. I have just been diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3.

I had some leg cramps and eating a banna helps,5

3 days in to taking the medicine and my BP is lower than I have ever seen it.  Only side effect has been redness of eyes in the morning when I wake up.  I have to use eye drops to clear them.

"I was put HCTZ by my doctor around 6-8 months ago, and around 2-3 months of taking the drug, my niece pointed out to me that my hair was getting deathly thin, and I tried to tell my doctor about it, and he wouldn't listen and basically said blood pressure pills don't think your hair out. *does an eye roll* I'm sure a lot of us know better than that. so I recently stopped taking the drug as now my hair is thinner than what it was and I'm just 25, so you can just imagine how this is for me, being so young and all... Even had my thyroid tested to see if that was the cause and it came back normal, so yeah this proves the pill is the main cause.... For those of you that are taking it, that are female and care about your hair like I do, stop taking the drug now, and get your doctor to switch it. ",1
I started using Hydrochlorothiazide in January and over the past few months have experienced numbness & tingling in hands and feet as well as an increase in appetite.  Anyone else have these side effects?,3

"I used HCTZ for about 4 months for high blood pressure, worked great. It had a VERY positive side effect, when taking early in the AM I did all my voiding in the next 14 hours. I also have BPH and used to get up 2 - 3 times a night but with this I made it threw a full 8 hrs of sleep before needing to void. Great for that but it started to upset my stomach and I needed to stop taking it and back to getting up 2 - 3 time a night. I only wish my stomach would have tolerated it better. There is some study's on this drug being used for BPH but it is still in research at this point so I am told. My hi/bl pressure came right back and I went on a calcium channel blocker with no stomach problems. Shame it was perfect for my BPH problem.",5

"Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed for my high blood pressure six months ago.  I took about 4 weeks for my blood pressure to stabilize, however, I notices that stress on my body, such as illness, will still elevate my blood pressure.  I have had the following side effects:  high calcium levels in the blood, labored breathing, shortness of breath, tightness in chest, loss of hair, near-sightedness, blurred vision, dizziness, memory loss, dry mouth, fatigue and feeling weak. There is a maternal family history of high blood pressure, stroke and heart attack.  I will rely on medication most likely for the rest of my life.  Seems that  it is trial and error in finding the right prescription with the least ""severe"" effects.  I have no other health issue besides the high blood pressure, that last thing anyone wants to do is create a health problem while trying to achieve good health.  ",2

Took it in the past for losing weight and worked fine but now I have low blood sugar and after taking one pill had bad back pain in kidneys all day. Stopped and will not take again. Taking lisinopril 20 mg to control BP taking at night and it works fine. Also taking Xanax 5 mg morning and at bedtime. Both work fine.,1

Had to start taking this at night due to becoming sleepy at work, I am very sleep frist thing in the am, but do start to feel better by mid-morning.  It has not seemed to help the ringing in my ears, seems to have helped with dizziness but the surprise is that it has helped with hot flashes.

"IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING EXTREME FATIGUE?   The first day I took this medication I was so dizzy & nauseous I should not have even been driving home from work. I had to ease into it 1/4 a day for a week and increase by 1/4 each week for a month until I was up to a whole pill.   I did experience the sensitivity to sunlight  as well although I started it right at the end of summer so I haven't had much experience with that yet.   The biggest problem I am having now is keeping my eyes open in the middle of the work day. I am also on Prozac & my dosage was upped. I thought it was that so I started taking the Prozac at night and the HTC after lunch. However, even with the switch I am still having trouble staying awake at work and when I get home, I usually sleep for a couple hours, get up, have dinner & go back to bed.   It seems to be helping with my blood pressure, but, I cannot continue to live like this.   Is anyone else having extreme fatigue from this medication? Any advice? Are there other options I should ask my doctor about?",5
After taking this med for six months my bp was not under control and I was so tired all the time I began sleeping approx 16 to 18 hours a day. Experience weight gain yet hardly ate due to lack of appetite.  Experienced chest pains and ended up in the emergency room where I found out that I was suffering from renal insufficiency due to this medication. If you take this med make sure to get your kidney function checked or you may end up with more problems that you started with. My doctor refused to refer me to a nephrologist and tried to tell me that the test results from the ER visit were wrong and that the ER dcotor didn't know what he was talking about. She then tried to convince me that I was sleeping so much due to depression.  She was in CYA mode because you should have your kidney funstions checked routinely while on this med and she never sent me for any tests.  She did finally admit that blood work I had done right before I started taking this showed my kidneys were functioning normally.  I had to change doctors to get a refferal to ka idney specialist. I am wating for reuslts of some tests to find out the extent of kidney damage and if it is permanent.,1

"Don't pay attention to most of these reviews.     Easy of use? What is easier than swallowing a tablet?  Sulfa containing? Yes..read precautions and interactions.  Dehydrated? You are supposed to loose fluids...drink water.  Don't take drug when you don't want to be using the bathroom frequently (sleep time, etc)  This is an old ""tried and true"" drug for treatment. It is certainly inexpensive ...so easy on the pocketbook.  Talk with your pharmacist if you have questions because most physicians don't have the time to properly discuss medications.",5

I had been having numbness, stinging and burning in the balls of my feet and up into my toes now for around 3 years with it continuelly worsening.  they have checked me for everything,  vitamin deficiencies, diatbetes, anything that could cause this.   They came up with no reason for this happening.  I have went to different medical doctors, nuerologists, podiatrists, spine dr.   Anyone and everyone... no answers.   After researching about medications on the internet I had notice that hydrochlorathiazine shows many side effects, one of them being numbness, and burning in feet and neuropathy.    I have went off of this for about 3 weeks now and am noticing they my feet seem to be getting better but very slowly.  It used to be that I could not even walk on a floor barefoot without severe pain and I couldn't get to sleep at night because of the burning and stinging in my feet.    It seems to be getting better.   Could this medication be the cause and if so what can I take as a different medication in place of this.   I have been taking it now for 12 years.   I am taking it because I have too much calcium in my urine that has caused me to get kidney stones.   I have noticed also that my blood pressure is a little higher now after going off of it, but that is not why I was put on the medication.

It was not consistent enough to assume it was the drug.  Rash, itiching, especially on scalp and arms, armpits, ect.  when I realized something was wrong, I stopped taking all meds for a week or two, no rash no swelling. Then I gradually started back one by one taking my meds.  As soon as I took the hydrochlorot, the itching and the rash came back.  I could not belive that after taking the pill for so long 20 years 12.5 mg, that I was having these problems, but realized I was having them all along. it was not until recently the sysmptons got worse.  The pill worked fine in lowering my blood pressure that's why I never paid attendtion to the sysmptons until the symptons were too annoying to ignore.  I did this test several times, stop taking all meds, even my supplements,( work out daily) and everytime.  The side effect (allergic reaction) or whatever you want to call it return.

The nausea lasted about 3-4 hours and was severe enough I had trouble sitting upright, let alone doing my job. Found out by trial and error that the way to avoid the nausea was to eat a very big breakfast--six slices of toast. As the years passed, I gradually was able to drop to five slices, then four, then three, and finally two. Also had to work a bit at keeping my potassium level in the normal range. If I didn't go out of my way to eat potassium-rich foods, my potassium level tended to drop just below the normal range and I'd get occasional leg cramps.",4

"I took this for about two years and it was very effective at controlling my blood pressure with few side effects...or so I thought.  Then last summer I developed a severe swelling in my right toe.  It was Gout.  A blood test confrimed that my uric acid level was over 10.  I drank a fair amount of beer back then and apparently the combination of this drug and drinking beer can cause your uric acid level to skyrocket which in turn causes Gout.  After discovering this, the doctor took me off of this drug and I stopped drinking beer completely.  It took about a month before I cold walk again without pain and after about four months my uric acid level was down to about five.  If you are on this drug, be sure that the doctor checks your uric acid level when taking blood tests especially if you drink beer).  If it is high, then get off this drug.  You do not want to get Gout! It is painful as hell and it takes a long time to heal.      ",5

"I have hypertenion(high blood pressure)& retain flood in my ackles&Feet, & Abdomen, I get blotted and cant breeth, This med, lowers my bloodpressure and gets rid of the swelling. Its a water pill that makes me produce fluid out of my body.. It works really well for my. ",5
"i am taking this drug with Benicar which is very new to me. I just changed my blood pressure medicine and now I believe taking this hydrochlorithiazide medicine with Benicar is causing pain in the stomach, dirrhea, chills. I am not sure if this is it but I believe that it is because I never and very seldom get dirrhea. I have only been taking Benicar for about a couple of weeks now.",3
I was in the hospital within four days of beginning this medication....would not recommend to anyone..,1
"Been on this med since Nov. 2008. The first 3 days on the drug I lost 7 pounds! My BP was high 140's over high 90's. The only side effects I can think of was the frequent urination. I changed my lifestyle completely...eat no more than 1500 mg of sodium a day, and I exercise. I eat a banana and drink a glass of orange juice every morning with the pill, and I load up on water all day long. No swelling, muscle cramps, low potassium levels...nothing! Love it!      ",5

"Some increase in urination, which I expected.  I am tired, but I have been working 10-12 hour days for the past few months, so I didn't relate it to the drug side effects until I started reading the reviews on this site.  My skin is dry, but with winter being here, I didn't give it a thought until I read these reviews.  The worst problem I notice is a red and itchy rash on my neck in the ""collar area"".  I thought it was an allergic reaction to something,  or contact dermatitis, but believe it may be the medication.  I also have noticed I am much more sensitive to the sun. Have been on the medication for almost 4 months.  I need to discuss with my doctor to see if this is normal...what the solution might be...or if it's time to switch mediction.   ",5
"Was taking 1/2 of a 25 mg. pill, for 2 months.  Now taking the 25 mg. whole and the 3rd & 4th night after, awoke with a heaviness in my chest & difficulty breathing and a bad nausea feeling.  I also felt heaviness in my arms.  So far, I have not read any comments including the heaviness in the chest so I am concerned. I take this with metopolol, which I have taken for a long time, and yet that is in the morning and these side effects come in the middle of the night.",2

Take after supper as I fall asleep two hours after taking.Skip a pill every third day or so otherwise will snap at you. Tendonitis in thumbs is back as well as pain in feet and ankles. Took a week off of med. felt great all side effects left, but swelling returned.  Only med I take.  Got to be  better way.",3
My doctor told me to wean myself off the medicine in the fall.  I tried to do this but found that I was right back to water retention and my feet really hurt because of this.,4
"After two weeks of taking the medication, I started to lose my hair in large quantities. The Cardiologist says its not a side effect and to stop taking the meds and see what happends. I do no take any other medication, so it HAS TO BE the Hydrochlorothiazide.",4

"Glad I've read most of these reviews. Thought I was going crazy. Life has been all doom and gloom. Terrific weight gain, feet&ankles so swollen can hardly walk, skin very dry, face peeling, rashes on arms and legs, major cramps in legs, sometimes fingers and arms.  Back ache, sciatica.  No quality of life, no desire for anything or to do anything.  Need my life back, going to stop these pills today. New dr appt on Oct 1 at Southwestern Med Ctr in Dallas.  Hope they can figure me out. BP seems to be regulated so hopefully ceasing HCTZ will not change that.  Have gained 55 pounds in 6 months for no apparent reason.  Thought something might be growing inside me, but apparently not. DID I SAY I WAS DEPRESSED? Taking Zoloft, not doing any good. Up until I started taking this med, I felt okay.  Now it's how bad will I feel today?  Feel like a hypochondriac.  Don't socialize with anyone anymore, have cut all friends and family off.  Hope help is on the way.",2

It reduces a high blood pressure with a combination of Enalaprin ,3
"I was prescribed this drug by a doctor and started taking 12.5mg since Feb 2010.  I refilled the prescription on Aug 3,2010. I had never before been informed of any adverse effects from using this drug until Aug 3 refill, which came with an attached explanatory form. A short while after the commencement of taking this drug in Feb I started having breathing problems, dry mouth, and occasdional dizziness, which are some of he adverse effects of taking this drug according to the info I received with the refill.  Had I known about these side effects I would never have even considered taking the drug.  As of Aug 3rd I have stopped using this drug.  I still suffer from dry mouth, and the breathing problem, as well as some weakness.  Hopefully this will abate soon, and I can be back to my normal self.

"I have been taking 25mg for about 3 weeks, my bp was 130/108 and after 2 weeks it was down to 120/86.  I had no side effects and have actually been able to function a little better since I've been on this medication.",5

"I am sensitive to sulfa drugs or sulfonamides, so this drug causes negative side effects for me. They say that this sulfa based drug should not bother people with allergies to sulfa drugs, but it sure affected me. I didn't even know why I should have these effects from a low dose diuretic and didn't know it was sulfa based until I looked it up. It stated it's not life threatening so you can take it anyway.I had bloody noses, swollen nose and had to wear a nose strip, breathlessness, dizziness, and acid reflux. The dr looked at me funny when I told him all the side effects I had with it. The dr's tell you that these things can't happen with certain drugs, but they do. I was disappointed because it did really help with the water retention the short time I took it. I just can't deal with all those side effects.",5
I've been taking this medication along with another for my high blood pressure. It really works. My only complaint is that I have to go to the bathroom all the time. And when I am at work it's a headache for me. And alot of times it's only a tinkle but it feels like alot. Go figure.,5

"Started taking 10 mg. Didn't lower my BP.  My doctor switched me to 25 mg.  BP coming down, but now I have body aches (arms, legs, joints). Feels like I've been coming down with the flu the past 2 months. Have little energy, and feel tired a lot.",4
I have taken this drug for over ten years and still have kidney stones 5-8 times per year.,2

Initially my dosage was half tablet daily but was increased to 3/4 tablet daily. Since the increase my BP has come down from 148/94 to 120/80. I feel the drug was very effective. My only concern is that my mother was taken off the same drug because it was linked to renal failure.,4
i really have not seen a difference in measure of dropping my bp,2
"I couldn't afford my bp meds last month so couldn't take them (Enalapril included), however, I had been swimming 45 minutes 4 x a week.  I was able to buy them this month and after a week I am EXHAUSTED and have lost all energy, even to swim which I love so much.  Why or how or what could be going on?  I can't afford a doctor, I have no insurance and have found only part-time work.  I also take bipolar meds but combined with bp meds in the past never affected how I felt.  Now, all of a sudden, I can hardly get up and go. Any ideas?",3

Didn't do a thing for me.",1
ha and dizzy,2
feeling of hopelessness or doom,3
GOOD,3
Do not take this medication if you are allergic to sulfur containing medications. A young doctor that filled in for mine didn't properly assess my allergies and put me on this.  I had every severe reaction symptom from being so dizzy I couldn't walk to severe nausea. It also severely suppressed my sex drive and appetite.  I took it for 2 weeks.,1
i first was on lisinopril then switched to this due to side effects. My shoulder started aching terribly and my doctor told me was starting to get arthritis.  I stopped taking the pill and the pain is going away.  the doctor and pharmacist all said i should have had the pain in my knees or fingers if at all. but it was just my right shoulder. ,4
"I tried this Hzd for over five years in meds such as Dyazide, Mazide, etd.  The Hzd always ended up making me sick enough to quit taking BP meds.  Then I made up my mind to ask for small amt of Lsx instead and have been happy without side effects since.  My kidneys don't overwork on any of these. I take Atenolol along with it.  Thanks for this web site",1
I have only just started taking this medication but it has already lowered my blood pressure with out side effects.,4
I find this medication very easy to use and very effective in lowering my blood pressure.It is one of the older medications and very inexpensive. ,5

This medication lowered my blood pressure but with  that came serious vertigo approx.60 days after starting the med. I missed a lot of work and couldn't drive.  After 45 days of vertigo my Dr. has switched me to Lisinopril. So far so good.,1
"Erections not as strong, hoping this is only temporary ""side-effect""....",5
"I started taking this (25mg) 5 days ago for water retention due to bad PMS, prescribed by my doc, whom I LOVE.  So far, I have been dizzy most of the days, nauseaus all the time, heart flutters at night, can't really get a good night's sleep ...and don't really notice a huge diff. in urinating, as i drink a lot of water anyhow.

"After taking 10mg daily for just one week my doctor has taken me off this med due to the side effects. I was fatigued, lightheaded with tingling sensation in extremeties, blurry vision, high pulse rate and felt completely ""out of it"" to the point where I felt unsafe driving. Doc is waiting until next visit to try something else...hoping for better reaction to next med.",1
"Although I have hypertension, this drug was prescribed specifically for the severe water retention I experience on blood pressure medications and is used in conjuction with another hypertension medication.  Without it I go from having ankles to cankles and it hurts to walk.  On this medication and with the help of compression socks the swelling is kept to a minimum.  I would still like to see the water retention down a lot more so I don't have to buy (and handwash) the very expensive compression socks.  Not taking hypertension medications is NOT an option as I have been a stroke level for quite a while.",3

I am 70. Have been on this medication (started at 25mg per day) fo 35 years. Later was upped to 50 mg. Now 20 yrs later due to new ins I have a new dr who says this is excessive. I also take amlodipine5mg daily and Lisinopril 20 twice daily. My most recent reading was 120/72. Has been this way for some time.  New Dr. prescribed a new Lisinopril 20tab that also has hctz 12.5 twice a day along with the amlodipine daily. Hope we're not messing with a good thing. The only side effects I have experienced are frequent urination and sometimes dry mouth. Blood test showed I was low on potassium so I started that 3 yrs. ago.,5
Has worked to a degree for pain before back surgey.,3

All my fingers ached ... arthiritic type pain and oh, and I've developed trigger finger back to the doctor to try one of the many drugs out there for high blood pressure.  these medications give me the symptoms of high blood pressure, I never had any symptoms before starting on medication.

This has been the worst experience I have has in years. I was kept up most of the night and was constantly going to the bathroom. ,1

"I was prescribed the drug by my weight loss dr. I was able to loose over 10 lbs. in water weight alone in the first week. I have suffered with chronic headaches and joint pain since I was a teenager. During my weightloss, I noticed that my joint pain and headaches would go away within 30 mins. of taking the med. I visited my PCP and told him about this and he said that if this was working for me, there were little to no side effects and that he thought it would be fine to continue taking this drug to treat the symptoms. I am guessing that I am developing a more serious case of artheritis and that this drug is reducing the fluid retention on my joints and neck. It works and I like that.",5
I mostly take it as this is what my doc prscribed to take with my high blood pill.,4
"I began this drug a week ago and already dropped BP by 30 pts. It's comming down 220/117.  Think other pills and my age, lack of excercise keep me from losing weight.",4

side effects--uneven heart beat,4
"I am 33 y/o and was put on 37.5 HCTZ two months ago.  If I were to describe the side effects that started taking place a couple weeks ago I would sound insane. I did indeed, feel insane.  While I see this drug works for some people it scares me for those that will be effected as I have been. I have been off of it for a week now and am slowly feeling normal again.  I will never take this again and my doctor told me it was ""stress"" causing the reactions but since stopping this med, I am begining to feel like me again and I was getting scared I never would again.  I am going to eat better.. exercise more and stay away from pills because while some DO save lives.. I truly felt this one was going to kill me.  Light headed.. swimming head.. dizzy.. uncoordinated.. tightness in chest.. my chest hurt and fluttered.  I was not feeling bad before being put on this med. My bp was 130ish to 140ish over 84-88.  When I told my doctor what was happening.. he found my potassium too low.. gave me one week supplement.. felt little better and he added lisinopril and once supplements ended (could be no significance) .. the symptoms started right back up with my bp being 102/64 .. I have never been this low! Shortness of breath again.. you name it! I have quit them both and am seeking a new doctor. If your doctor does not listen to you .. switch. I thought since I was a little girl they were super human but even the ones who seem nice.. are not always the best. Mine kept telling me stress when I knew I was going through something very serious and could barely function!",1

My belly is the worst area!  Just the other day a woman asked me if I was pregnant and I don't even have children.  it's uncomfortable and I can't fit any of my clothes.  I am embarrassed and no longer do any of the things I enjoy because this weight gain has affected me in more ways that anyone can imagine. While this medicine has helped with my blood pressure, it seems I retain fluids more than I get rid of them and it's ruining my life in more ways than one!",4

Having a problem staying concentrated on a project because of tiredness.  Falling asleep as soon as I get home then waking up to do chores then sleeping again.  Wake up during the night with coughing and gasping for air.

I have been taking Hydrochlorothiazide for a few months now and I noticed the same side effects others stated. The fatigue was horrible. Some form of POTASSIUM must be taken with this drug as it is also a diuretic. My vitamin K level was very low and I am now taking a supplement along with hydrochlorothiazide.

I was 20 lbs overweight, not exercising routinely, and a caffeine & nicoteine user, and immediately, my BP dropped to normal levels with use. However, I am now beginning to notice some side effects. Recently started exercsing 4-5 times per week for 30 mins or more and my weight has dropped about 10 lbs and I feel very good. But noticed that my sex drive is somewhat impaired as maintaining an erection for an extended time can be ""challenging"". Originally, I thought it was my age (39), but after reading some of the responses, I am beginning to wonder. Will consult with doctor and quit medicating to see if BP stays stable as the result of the weight loss and exercise program. ",5
"One of the side effects of this drug indicates possible rash.  I developed lichen planus type rash which are ""purplish lesions that itch like chicken pox"".  Had to be treated by dermatologist to clear skin and stop itch but some scarring remains.  Cannot take any HCTZ combinations or sulpha diuretics so have difficulty controlling BP problem that I've had for more than 30 years. My Internist took me off of the HCTZ but a few years ago, my cardiologist insisted that I needed a small amount of diuretic added to the Benicar med that I was taking even after I told her about my reaction to HCTZ.  After only two or three doses, I had to return to the dermtologist due to the Lichen planus type rash associated with thiazide medication.",2

Have had endoscopy and colonoscopy which showed mild gastritis with no real cause.

Taking as prescribed by urologist for stone prevention. Three years stone free so far. However gout has been a reoccurring issue for over two years. Feels like I traded one pain for another.,4
I ended up with an annoying cough. Like a tickle in the back of my throat.,3
"I was placed on this medication because of edema after my last heart attack.  It worked great, I lost the water retention and was feeling great, then after about 6 months I started having horrible heart burn (may be because of allergy to sulfa).  Had to discontinue.  All water pills have sulfa base",5
sometime my feet and leg swell up,4
This drug was very effective for over 5 years.  Suddenly I experienced shortness of breath and extreme heart palpitations. I researched user reviews here on Web MD and found a couple reviews that matched my symptoms.  That was a Sunday and it was the last day I took Hydorchlorothiazide.  On Monday I felt 90% and on Tuesday I felt 100%.  No shortness of breath and no palpitations.  I saw my doctor on Wednesday and was prescribed a new BP medication.    I seriously wonder if this batch of product  was  contaminated.  Without going too far off the beaten path I want to say that I read recently about a generic drug manufacturer that was raided by  US Marshalls for REPEATEDLY failing to comply with FDA regulations.  who knows?  Anyway I feel better now.,5

I started taking HCTZ 25mg since 01/2007 and it has been very good for me. I had some rashes late 2007 and blamed it on my aftershave. Its cleared now. My Dermatologist agreed with me. Used Fluocinonide gel 0.5 to clear the rashes. My libido is not as it used to be. That`s all I can say on the side effect. I am satisfied with it. I bought me Resperate  and I do excercise a lot. Feel much better.,4
"Since college (30 years ago) my BP would go high (190/110) but I could always make it go down (130/80) by relaxing and deep breathing. About a month ago it started going up and would not come down. I was at the dentist and he refused to work on my tooth until the BP was down. I became worried and went to the DR. My DR. started me on enalapril 50mg/day for 2 weeks. This stabilized my BP at 145/93. My Dr. was not satisfied with the result and started me on HCZ 25mg along with the enalapril. The very first day was spent in bed asleep. I thought it was some kind of sedative. After several days of fighting the tiredness I came back alive. After a month of HCZ I still feel like I just ran the Boston marathon all the time. Periodically I will get a wasted day where I have to nap the day away. I don't experience most of the side affects listed by other reviewers, I'm stable on my feet, think clearly, no swelling or rashes, and have good mental energy. I've not had a problem with urination or constipation. I take the HCZ dose in the AM and by afternoon my stomach feels a bit queasy so I eat to settle it. This routine has developed into eating all the time in order to keep my stomach from being empty. Needless to say I'm gaining weight. I also experience an odd feeling of being slightly high from time to time...maybe this is the lightheadedness described by others. I've noticed if I sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes without talking, writing, or driving I will doze off. There's been some embarrasing moments over this affect. Oddly enough I have experience trouble sleeping at night. The last and worst side affect from the HCZ is loss of libido. My BP is now consistently at  110-120/78-82, but my pulse is always over 100, something I never had a problem with before HCZ. For now I will learn to tolerate the HCZ side affects as dialysis, aneurisms, and stroke is something I wish to totally avoid.",5

I'd rather have had the loss of appetite and weight loss that everyone else seems to have. Wouldn't it be nice if our doctors warned us about these things first, instead of making us figure it out for ourselves 6 months later? I'm going to stop taking this pill. I'd just rather have HBP.",3

The first two months I felt fine but now I have swollen ankles and the skin hurts, sometimes my arms hurt and some tingling on my toes and my inner wrist itch. I don't know if its the Amlodipine or the Hydrochlorot or both. I'm not taking the Amlodipine tonight to see if I notice any difference. This is the 3rd change in medicine for my BP. Does anyone know if Hawthorne works for reducing BP? I will be calling my doctor in the morning.",3
"At first, the drug worked great.Later, however, I began to have rapid heart beat problems with it. First, it was a few flutters, then all of a sudden, my rate went up to 130 just sitting! When I stopped taking the drug, I felt great, no flutters, no rapid rate. I was also taking lisinopril which does OK on its own.I was surprised to have this drug do this but I have friends who have had the same problem and have had to stop it.",4
"I took this drug for about 5 months and it did help reduce my blood pressure.  However, after about 3 months, I developed a very bad rash over much of my body that itched excessively.  After I discontinued the medication, it has taken more than 9 months for the rash to go away. ",1

Everything seemed to work for a few years taking this drug BUT....I had terific pain in my right side under my ribs and went to er. I had pancreitis. why?

I take this as a water pill for edema due to Hepatitis C and it has helped the swelling and water retention.  I also take a Blood Pressure pill along with this pill.,4
I have been taking this med for quite some years. It has been wonderful. No side effects at all. I also stopped taking another med that I was taking with thie HCTZ due to the fact that the HCTZ is working so well for me. Im in my early 40s.,5

I also had severe dizziness (mainly at night), constant weakness, confusion, and a fast heartbeat. I also had trouble sleeping at night due to the fast heartbeat and dizziness.

Last summer I had an experience with gout-like pain: it's the thiazide; I also had a scary experience with a collapse at the gym.  Beware moderate to heavy exercise: excessive perspiration creates a dangerous situation with HCTZ leading to preventricular contractions and seizure-like symptoms.",5
"After taking this medication for about 3 - 4 years I started to develope a sever pain in my right big toe joint.  Gout?  Pain comes on for 2 - 3 days and after taking moltrin goes away.

"I have been taking this drug (25 mg, two times daily) for at least 3 years and have tolerated it very well.  I have swelling in one leg, due to trauma and sometimes wear a compression stocking if I stand for long periods of time.

Told Doc I was allergic to sulpha drugs but he didn't think there was enough in it to bother me.WRONG!!!Druggist suggested I need a new Doctor I will never take this drug again.

"I've been on this med for 3 weeks now.Taking 25mg daily. The first week was very rough with side effects of dizziness, nausea at times, some minor aches and pains and some mild chest pain and tightness. I also have to take Atenolol 50mg daily. It took 11 days before I started having more times during the day where I felt better and even some days where I felt normal again. I highly recommend that anyone who experiences dizzines to take Meclizine 25mg OTC. Its just a motion sickness pill but its the only thing out there to help combat the dizziness. Also my Dr suggested taking Benedryl to help with dizziness & nausea if need be. It does help. I still have days or periods during a day where I dont feel great sometimes but nothing like the first 1.5 weeks.",4
I go to the rest room a lot more than I used to which is ok because I do not need the extra water in my body.,5
"Tried this med for two weeks, BP not changed. My side effect was EXTREME tenderness under my left arm area. Felt like an internal severe rash.(?) Dr. changing to a new RX today. Potassium level ok.",1
1/2 of a 25 mg pill daily has been totally effective to treat my high blood pressure and I do not experience any side effects.,5
I started taking it after my bloodpressure did not lower using an ACE inhibator.  I was to add this to the ACE.  My pressure did not change,1
I've only been taking it for a week.  So far so good.  This is the third medication that I've tried.  This one seem to work better than the others.  I am concerned about the numbness some has reported that they have experienced.  ,4

My B/P is higher & my anxiety 10 times worse.""I am on meds for that also."" I have only been on it a week but I can not function with this medication. Back to the drawing board. The only good benifit was the 10 lb weight loss .     ",3

"I was given Hydrochlorothiazide and I immediately started to break out in hives, rashes and skin bubbles,muscle aches. I had to take a prednisone pill to calm the side effects down. This was given with Ziac for my blood pressure. I am calling the doctor today before I end up in the hospital.",1
"In the last year I have developed numbness in my feet. I'm interested in the review by the person who said they were experiencing that, too. Do you have more info on that? I never thought of this medication being part of that problem, nor have my doctors. ",4
I've been taking this for over 6 months now and it's been very effective for me.Except for the constant urination for the first 3 hours after taking it. I forgot to refill it and was off of it for about a week. I stated to swell in my ankles and legs but my blood pressure never went up. Was treated at the emergency room and started my meds aging the next day. No more swelling and pressure still down. I'm happy with the results.,4
"dizzy, weakness,disoriented, less urination, no apparent change in blood pressure.",2
just took it for the first time this morning .they know i'm allergic to sulfa so i don't know why thye gave it to me. after reading this i know now i shouldn't have taken it.sitting here waiting to see if the rash starts.,3
I have been taking this pill at the same dosage for 15 years and have had no problems until recently.  I've notice occasional dizziness and about a year ago I started developing a numbness in my feet.  I just read in the description of the pill that this can be a rare side effect. I will talk with my doctor about it and do more research as well.  Has anyone else noticed this??,5
When my Dr. put me on this med my feet and legs were hurting and within taking two pills my feet and legs and decrease in fluid.  I feel so much better.,4
"Stomachache, muscle cramps and severely bloated since started on this medication. Will see Dr. to change medication asap. ",3

"I've been taking Hydrochlorothiazide for 6 months now. I have had excellent results with only occasional light dizzyness shortly after dosing. Unlike many of the reviewers,I read the precautions and stopped all alcohol consumption. It say it right there on the bottle as well as the medical recommendations my Doctor gave me. Not to consume alcohol. To drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. I know from experience with other health issues as well as treating those in chronic pain. Dehydration can cause a host of serious problems. A drug that takes excess water out can only work effectively if no alcohol and lots of water is consumed. ",5
I have been on the drug for a week and it has been very effective. My blood pressure has dropped seven points and swelling around ankles has decreased. No side effects to speak of and no increase in urine output. I exercise and hydrate often and have not notice an increase in urine output. ,5
 HCTZ is effective in the extraction of excess water and fluids from the body. I have also noticed deep mental and emotional mood swings that last only as long as the reccomended dosage taken. ,4
I just started taking this and I am ok with it so far.  Reading the comments. Sounds like some may have allergic reaction to sulfa{skin rashes} and others may have decreased potassium..muscle cramps. Y'all get your pharmacist involved with your side effects related to medication!,4
"I was taking something else, but it wasn't working well because of mitral valve prolapse and was changed to hydrochlorazide.",5
dizziness,3
This medication has caused some stomach pain for me.,4
I have had very good luck with this med.  My blood pressure has dropped significantly.,5
"I have only been on this for a week, but I haven't had any more urine output (maybe even less than normal, b.c. I usually go a lot, but not now). I have been wearing compression hose--knee high at work, thigh high at night--so the less fluid retention is from that. I started the hose before the meds. The dr said my fluid retention was ""scary"" when he saw it, but it had already gotten better since summer, when it started. I now have periods of profuse sweating and weakness and feel nauseous, but don't know if that is related. I'll talk to the dr office tomorrow.",1
Decreased appetitite for alcohol :( and premature ejaculations :(,5
"Reduced bp 5 mm to pre-hyertensive.  Side affects are a bit much to deal with; rapid heart beat, palpitations, a feeling of being light headed most of the time, slight dizziness, as well as weight gain.  Urine output has increased but not to a point of being bothersome.  Shortness of breath is of concern.  Difficult to lose weight, despite a reduction of calories and aerobic exercise four times a week.  These symptoms reflect 12.5 mg dose. Potassium not terribly effective in reducing heart related side affects.",1
"immediately after starting this medication my pressure went to 120/80.  Several months later I got severe pressure in my head that after two days I also had difficuly walking a straight line, my doctor and neurologist sent me to the emerceny room, then admitted me.  They did a cat scan and a mir which showed nothing.  Its almost two months since this started and I still have no clue.  I was reading the side effects on hysrochlorothiazide 25mg and it said dizziness could be a side effect........",5
I started this Hydrochlorothiazide in April 08. It worked fine until the hot weather started. I then noticed this itchy blotchy rash on any sun exposed areas. I proceeded to a skin doctor and she didn't really no what it was so she took a biopsie. We also decided to stop the Hydrocholorothiazide the rash got alot better. I'll try to get to the point that is I drink alot of beer so maybe the side effects are lingering after 2 weeks. No rash but stinging tingling on face arms and legs After 2 weeks could it be the alcohol continuing the side effects. I would think the drug would be out of my body by now. THANK YOU.,3
This med makes me feel lightheaded and tingling in my arms...otherwise I guess it's OK ??,3
"rash, iching, slight swelling",4
I've had no problems with this drug.  I've had bad headaches and swelling when I stop taking it on a daily basis.,5

"My doctor told me I was ""in the books"" from suffering 2 bouts of pancreatitis due to HCTZ. After 3nd visit to ER was taken off this drug & put on Furosemide (Lasix). Since HCTZ is a photo-sensitive drug, I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who developed vitiligo while taking HCTZ. Could this be a side-effect? ",3
Have seen a slow change in my blood preasure. Was 180/90 and with the medication for 3 months its now 145/81. But also needed it for my swelling in my feet.,2
"Lowered my blood pressure to a normal rate, but am suffering from the side effects: rash, very itchy, blurred vision, ""charley Horses"" in legs, stinging sensation in legs and arms. Am going to the dr to see about another pill.",5
Taking 12.5 milligrams.  It makes you urinate a lot.  I have chronic dry mouth and halitosis as a result.  Need something else.  That's a side effect I'm not willing to live with.,4
"I wrote the review below. This is an update, it has now been about 2 and half weeks since Ive started using this medication. My blood pressure is now hovering around 125/83. I am very satisfied with this medication, in fact Im very happy. Both Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide together make a very good team for me. (I am a Black Female) I do not get any headaches anymore, in fact I cannot recognize any side effects since I started using this, other then having to urinate many times during the day. And having problems with bowel movements, also my potassium levels are very low, as Im told this medication depletes potassium levels. I`ve also noticed something odd, since I started taking the medication, I have noticed that I am not as hungry as I used to be, and I noticed Ive lost some weight. Mostly water weight I assume. ",5
"I have hypertension, 190/125 is normal with no pills. I started taking this with Ramipril and after one week my BP is down to 145/100. I was on Adalat before and BP was normal 130/80 with Adalat. Im hoping for better results with Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide. So far, I have trouble having bowel movements if I dont drink enough water. I urinate all the time, Ive had headaches as well for the first few days but they have subsided. I started on this drug because I have Polycystic Kidney Disease, Im told these drugs are better for me. ",3
"I began taking this medication when ankles, feet and toes swelled and became painful.  After starting this medication, I noticed that I have ankles again!  The only drawback is that my stomach is itchy.  ",5

"I take 25mgs/day along with 40mgs of Lisinopril for high blood pressure.agrivates my gout condition and i dont know why the doctor cant find another pill that doesn't.he told me to cut the dosage in half but i got severe headaches and went back 25mgs.also take 300mgs of allopurinal for gout,1000mgs metformin and 20mgs glyburide for diabetes,and 150mgs ranitidine for acid reflux so i couldn't tell you what side effects go with this drug.here they are..diarrea,stomach pains,enlarged prostate,bleeding,kidney pain,gout in feet,frequent urination.",2
If you have a lifestyle change that puts you in direct contact with Sunlight then this med is not for you. I got very bad blisters on the areas of my body exposed to sunlight alot. I had to stop the medication and get a new one. The pain lasted over a week and I had to suffer the entire time. I had to stay away from the sun and stay in cool rooms and also apply compresses to the pain to avoid scratching so much. I had to wait until the medicine left my system entirely so the side effects would go away.,3
"Have experienced problems with itching, rashes, coughing and weight loss.  Will not take again.",1
"I started HCTZ 25MG a week ago and immediately had strange stinging pains in my legs.  Talked to the DR. and he told me to try a half dose, 12.5 MG.  Will try this dose for one more week.  No big change in BP numbers.",2
"After reading comments, I thought it time to add my own. Side effects come and go by skipping a dose for two days.  I have suffered numbness and tingling in hands and feet for 8 years with 3 Doctors sending me for all kinds of tests.  They never thought of the med until I accidentally missed 2 doses. Weight gain of 7-10 pounds during missed dosage.  Extreme dry mouth if 4 liter of water not consumed.Nevr thought about sex drive.  Haven't had one in years.",4
My doctor prescribed it and I love it. It helps keep my water retention down. ,5
"I am suffering from extreme stomach upset, nausea and diahhrea. Tingling of the arms and shoulders are very scary in the middle of the night. I take 25 mg.",4

My blood pressure has significantly improved and my chronic headache has disappeared.,5
My BP has decreased great!I am urinating more often so I take my dosage in AM.But I am having muscle cramps all over not just legs.Side effect?,5
Iuse HTCZ as a water pill mainly and I have been on it for over 5 years. I have had no side effects what so ever.,5
"Worst bp medicine ever been on. Severe dizziness, numbing, tingling of legs, feet and hands. impotence. stopped taking 2 days later all side effects gone. lisinopril works better for me.",3
MAKES BOWEL MOVEMENTS HARD IF DONT DRINK ENOUGH EXTRA WATER ,3
"I had to use the bathroom every 45 minutes until the meds were used up.  Usually all morning.  I suddenly became lightheaded after several years of use.  The first day I tried going w/o it, it improved, and by the second day it was gone.  My blood pressure has not yet increased, however I still take Lisinoprel.  I have not noticed my hands swelling or other fluid retention since not taking this med.  I wonder how much good I was really gaining from it while I did use it for all that time.  I was surprised that side effects would start after all this time.  Perhaps I built up an intolerance to it over time.",3
Should u take potassium with this med,5
It works in combination with other drugs,3
"I didn't like this medicine because after one month of using it, I experienced extreme dryness with my skin. My fingertips split and it caused a rash on my face. Painful! I asked the doctor about it and she changed it to lisinopril. There has not been enough time to see what changes that will bring.",4
I have been suffering from perceived hearing loss due to fluid retention in my ear (I have TMJ). The HCTZ has cleared up the fluid and pressure in my ear. My hearing has improved and I feel much better.,4
"I have been on it for three days and have lost 5# so far. My legs are cramping up too.  Have some dizziness as well, but it is doing good for my blood pressure.",4
my sexual gone. how do i get it back,4
"i was prescribe this drug due to pre-hypertension, my blood pressure wasn't that bad, but the doctor recomended it so i would not have future problems, I started with the 12.5 and it seemed to work well, I did that for two months, my blood pressure droped to a healthy level, but after a few stress episodes it went up a little bit, he put me back on the pill but this time the 25ml... this one gave me side effects, mostly headaches, after a month i stopped taking it, it's getting back to normal, but it has taken some time, i hope i don't have to use this pill again, i can recomend ""Ameal BP "" i bought at the local wallgreens and it has done wonders for me, it's a suplement that helps maintain healthy blood pressure, the ingredients on the suplement is Ameal Peptide, been taking it for two months, no side effects whatsoever.",2
Works very well,5
"I was placed on HCTZ, 25mg, for the diuretic effect (as an alternative to Lasix), my BP is typically only 110/70. Because of that I have had issues associated with low BP, dizzy, postural hypotension. I haven't so much noticed the diuretic effect, as it's more of a controlled release than Lasix which hits you here, now, and hard. Overall I think I will continue to take the medication, with any medication you have to give it some time and often the side effects with disappear or become more managable. ",3
I am still learning about this medication so to comment on its usage and effectiveness would be premature. However for the limited time of its usage it has been very effective.,3
"I AM ONLY ON IT FOR 4 DAYS, BUT I AM HAVING SOME BLURRING OF MY VISION WHEN READING AND SOME MUSCLE CRAMPING IN MY HANDS AND FEET.",3

The problem I've been having is water retention and an increasing weight gain that I can't seem to get ahead of.  If I miss my dose of HCTZ, my weight skyrockets over night. I didn't get my perscription refilled in time and missed 2 days and my weight jumped 15 lbs. in that time. That had me scared. Just got the perscription last night.

I noticed it helped but overall did not see significant change as the problem actually was with my low blood pressure. Last June I noticed a skin rush but thought maybe it was something I ate. August 18th I was taken to ICU as I woke up with my lips, tongue, and jaw swollen and small rushes all over my body. Still, I did not connect it with Approvel as I have been taking it for a while. I was given cortisone with antihistamines and returned home. On and off body rushes every 2-3 days and on 26th Sept I told my doctor so he said to stop the BP medication as it could be a pill side effect. Today, 29 Sep 2017 I woke up at 5.30 in the morning with the exact the same reaction (swollen lips, tongue, rush). Was taken again to ICU and repeated the whole process. This time my blood pressure that was 14.3 over 11.5. Needless to say, I was really scared so as I did not take any other medication just the BP ones. Long story short! I don't think I will be taking this BP drug again.Thanks for the patience in reading this.",3

Now on this for four years and can barely walk.  My feet have been checked for nerve damage, but there is none.  I am blaming this condition on the Losartan and hope that I can find another BP drug that will keep my pressure within reason.

BP is down to 121/77- pulse 64,5
"I was prescribed Losartan HCTZ50-12.5mg per day when I had my yearly physical in September, 2013. I will say this: it lowered my BP from about 140/80 down to 106/60, but it was at the expense of having weakness in my legs, dry mouth, and the most important thing, I believe it caused me to have trigeminal neuralgia. Losartan opens up the blood vessels/veins to help reduce the blood pressure, but I think the dilation of the blood vessels in my brain caused it to rub the trigeminal nerve and triggered a painful attack. I have been weaning myself off this stuff, taking gabapentin(300mg X 3 a day). I want to get this drug out of my system as soon as possible! It's not for me. I will talk to the Dr. about something else at my next visit. Good luck!",1

I felt ""foggy"" out of focus and could barely make it through my work days.  I have exercised 3-5 times a week for 11 years and I could barely get off the couch while taking this.  It wasn't a good match for my energy level and I can't stand feeling that out of it and tired. ",4
"I started med. about 2 years ago and it seemed to work. but in the past 4 months I have dealt with some many side effects that I just want to scream and I want people to know. It caused painful urination,swollen joint, fatigue, rash and itching, nasal conjstn, blurry vision,dry mouth,back pain,and bowel troubles. It has been awful and it has caused me to be so depressed with all the things going on. Plus sleep lose and worry.  If this is prescribed for you pay attention to your body and quit if you start feeling bad.  It only gets worse the longer you take it!!",1
Mild Hypertension.  Works well for me.,5
I took this drug and it caused severe hypoglycemia.  Was taken to hospital.,1
"My doctor had to switch my blood pressure medication 3 times before I found a medication that worked well for me. Losartan is what I'm taking now.  I have been on it for 3 months now.  I liked Losartan because I hadn't noticed any side effects until recently. Maybe it's just me but this is what I'm experiencing now.  The Losartan pills I used to get from CVS were round and white. I took those for 2 months and they worked great.  Last time I went to get my prescription of Losartan though the pills were oblong and yellow. I tried to look the pills up online and I found some pictures of Losartan but no pictures of what I’m taking now (imprinted with APO on one side and 10012.5 on the other).  I noticed with the yellow Losartan ills I get some stomach discomfort if I take them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.  The other pills (white) never bothered me.  I also noticed some swelling in my ankles toward the end of the day which I never had before.  I wondered if maybe the coating in this pill (yellow) was different or something else that my body doesn't like.  Then again, I'm not a doctor and realize this could just be my body.  Overall, this medication has worked better for me than my past two medications - Atenolol and Amlodipine Besylate.  Atenolol controlled my blood pressure but made my ears ring real bad.  The Amlodipine did not work for me at all. ",4
Due to someones error I was taking 200mg of this med. In an out of the hospital since a year ago. They finally raised a red flag my last hospital stay to the losartan over dose. Can anyone tell me if they to have had an overdose issue with this med ? It states right on my script bottle to take one pill by mouth twice a day ! I can't seem to get to feeling better. Will it stop the constant sick feeling !,1
"I hate this medicine. I have had so many side effects. Gout,cough,sinusitis,knee pain and joint pain. It hasn't helped my blood pressure either. It has made my tacky- cardia worse. And has possibly caused problems with my stationary tubes and more ringing and noises in my ears. I have lost some hearing too. They should band this drug.I never had problems with my stationary tubes before not until I was put on this drug.",1
rash on arms,2
I have been taking this medication for 2 years and is the first medication to actually keep my blood pressure under control.  I do experience some coughing but definately feel 100% better overall since taking this medication.,5
I can stop coughing with this medication.  A thick mucus in my throat.  It travels to my stomach and gives me an upset stomach.  Don't take this medication unless you want endless coughing!,3
"I am taking this to lower blood pressure.  It has done that.  The biggest complaint is going to the bathroom all of the time, especially at night.  I wake up every two to three hours and have to go.  I have dry mouth so i keep a water bottle by my bed at all times.  The constant getting up at night keeps me from getting a good night rest which makes me tired all day.",3
All is well except I had been taking Bonapril and developed a terrible cough and was in hopes the cough would get better . Will it??,4
so far so good,3
"Constant cough, poor alternative to Micardis.",3
"my blo0d pressure does not seem steady taking this drug. sometimes it is 120/80 and next time it is 150 85 or more I am taking a generic, labled sz 390",2
Seems like my BP is better controlled with Losartan.,4
"A nightmare drug! Losartan gave me severe chronic bronchitis. I thought I had developed late-onset asthma, and was suddenly, horribly tied to a preventive inhaler, an emergency inhaler (albuterol) and a nebulizer. I thought the breathing problems were associated with a recent thyroid operation, but when I found the 8% side effect of upper respiratory infections due to Losartan, I stopped taking the drug and breathing difficulties improved quickly and dramatically! No more inhalers! Occasional throat clearing only. Beware of this drug!",1
"I've been on this drug for 7 months and Finally found out why I feel so horrible. Back pain, breathlessness, itchy eyes, dehydrated, blurry vision, anxiety, depression, gained weight, tired all the time but can't sleep, nausea, severe cramping in legs & hips. Am on it for my Diabetes. I have to stop it. I thought I was just falling apart. Terrible drug. ",1
Currently prescribed 2-100/12.5 tabs daily. Only experiencing barely acceptable results. Most concerned about side effects.Do not beleive this is best for me. ,3
"Started taking Losartan-HCTZ couple months ago. BP stable, but have develope blurry vision, chronic dry cough and hives on arms and legs.",3
This is the 5th med I have used?,4
prescribed after losartan alone did work well enough,4
"I was switched from Lipitor for obvious reason more than one year ago.  I have found my blood pressure more controlable on Losartan than on Lipitor.  It is very easy to take with or without food, and remember, it may cause urination about 4 hours after takin, so please take it during the day or morning so you won't have to interrupt your sleep.  Happy in Arizona.  I am female and 68 years young.",5
only thing seem to help with my B/P,5
especially no side effects. high bp effectively controlled.,5
My BP has not gone down after 4weeks on this med. It was 146/102 with a pulse of 106 this morning. That seems to be Avg. for myself on this medication. Will ask my Dr. for an alternative next week. ,2
This medication has caused severe dryness in my mouth and it feels like I have cotton in my mouth...,1
my bp doesnt go down like it did with diovan,2
"Since I started taking this medicine 7 months ago, I've developed severe pain in my right leg constantly. Have been taking OTC arthritis pain medication but it doesn't really help. I suspect it's the Losartan HCTZ. My pressure isn't low 146/90 today. And my hair is falling out and much thinner than it was before I started taking this medication.   ",2
It lower my bloodpressure and does not experience any side effects.,3
controll bloodpressure,4
I am taking this for high blood pressure and to protect my kidneys from further damage.  It has worked.  Frank C.,3
"I've been taking this drug for less than a year , hasn't really moved my pressure anywhere.  Terrible metallic taste in my mouth, feel nausea alot and overall terrible feeling.  Gonna try going on something else.",2
"I have musle cramps in legs and hips, weight gain and allover feeling of tiredness. Not good for me.",1
"Tends to make me a bit sleepy about 30 mins. after taking it, but overall, my BP dropped to normal levels within 2 days of taking it. No serious side effects except a little back pain at night that may or may not be related. No increase in glucose levels although I'm type 2 diabetic on insulin and another injectable for control. I've taken several BP meds and strengths but taking just one of the 100/25 mg. is working fantastic!!!",5
"I developed severe depression and anxiety shortly after starting this medicine.  I gained a lot of weight and I am restless at night, therefore tired and want to sleep all day.",5
i need to know if i can eat grapefruit with this drug ,5
Has anyone else expierenced any shoulder pain muscle cramps with this medication,4
I want to know what the active and the inactive ingredients are in this white round Losartan by Sandoz Co.,3
I take the Losartan 100mg.  Once a day.,5
"Side effects - muscle pain, feeling of being dehydrated, salty taste, dry mouth, prespiration, loss of energy",3
"I have experienced no negative side effects to this medication,  I have a very sensitive system so this is a good thing this medication has been very effective",5
It lowered my bp but my vision is blurry and it has caused a bad rash on my eye lids and below my eyes.  They also itch and are runny.  Just horrible!  I have to call my doctor in the morning.,4
I started this drug approx. 2 years ago. 1 year ago the Dr reommended I use a niacin also. 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. After doing some research I found that both of these can make you hyperglycemic. Great! I have stopped the niacin but with little insurance I will stay with Losartan/HCTZ because it does keep the b.p. within range and I have not experienced any side effects.,4
" This medication often causes my blood pressure to be very low. I suffer with muscles pains and cramps, my hair is thinning very badly and I often experience a breathless feeling.",4
"I've been taking this med for just a bit less than a month.  My headaches are gone, but I have dry mouth through the night and my nose is so stopped up that I thought I had a bad cold - but I had no other symptoms.  I'm sure it's this medicine.  I hadn't thought about my newfound back pain as being caused by this script, but after reading these reviews, I'm beginning to wonder.  It's time to go back to a cheaper, older med that worked better for me.",4
can this drug cause severe back pain,5
Switched to this medication from Diovan HCTZ because of insurance company and my blood pressure averaging borderline numbers when on Diovan my pressure ran on average 116/70.  Feel dizzy a lot and muscle soreness and cramping.  ,4
Switched to this medication at the urging of my insurance carrier. The results have been equal to my previous. The only difference I have is that I have developed a chronic dry cough.,4
i have not had any problems so far while on this drug and bp is normal.,4
"Been taking this medication for about 3 months, and started great, but this month I started having irregular hearbeats. Dizziness, leg cramps, and knee pain. In addition i feel fatigue and have had change in my vision. My blood pressure readings prior to taking Losartan htcz was runnung 140/100 now they are running 112/66. I feel horrible most of the time and will be requesting a change with my rx.",2
Was switched from Lisinapril 40mg to Losartan HCTZ 100/25mg and BP dropped from average 145/80 to 120/70 with no adverse side affects to complain about.  ,5
"I was taking Diovan/HCT for about 18 months. The insurance company wanted me to switch my medication due to the cost. My doctor put me on Losartan/HCTZ. My blood presure at times is slightly higher than when I was taking Diovan/HCT, but overall it is in an acceptable range and my doctor is happy with the numbers. I have no side effects from this medication. ",4
"have head pains, stomach pains. after 2 days don't want to take it for a mounth.",1
Drowsy when I first take it.,4
My insurance has decided that this would work as good as Bencar and less expensive. I took for one month and found that my blood pressure has gone up quite a good amount.  Had problem sleeping and noticed that vision started to get blurry.  Call doctor and I am now back on Bencar and feeling better.,1
"Was taking Diavan/HCT - which worked very well, but insurance stopped covering. Blood pressure is slightly higher now, experience muscle weakness and leg cramps,sometimes metal taste. I also experience insomnia and shortness of breath. I have also noticed a change in my vision, ",3
"Developed cough, have leg cramps at night and severe itching of skin. Took Bencar before but too expensive to continue.",3
"The HCTZ 12.5 mg caused me to have irregular heartbeats, chest pain, leg pain, swelling in the feet & ankles, fatigue, dizziness & feeling of doom.  I thought I was having a MI but all cardiac workup results were negative.  I got off the HCTZ & within 4 days I felt like a new person.  Have not had any heart symtoms since Feb 2011 when I went off the medication.  I had to dig but found here at WEBMD the very same symptoms I was having.  These symptoms are not included in the PT info.    ",1
i have been taking losartan for 6 months 12.5 mg. once a day  I am having leg cramps fatigue frequent urination shortness of breath nasal congestion works great on lowering by blood pressure makes me feel lousey the trade off is NOT worth it!!!,4
my blood pressure went up after I started taking this pill. I did not have that problem when on Hyzaar/ 100/25,2
"I was on Hyzarr for over a year with no problems, but since I have switched to the generic form, Losartin HC I have dizzy spells, a metallic taste in my mouth, nausea,very tired and my blood pressure has gone up slightly.",2
"I was taking Lisinopril for my blood pressure problem but developed a chronic cough.  My doctor switched me to Losartan-HDC which elimated the cough, managed my blood pressure but have developed chronic nasal congestion and experience leg cramps at night.",4
BP was 194/100 and climbing. Lisinopril made me cough all the time & my eyes water; I felt awful. Switched to Losartan-HDC & my BP dropped to 125/71 & remains in that range. I have some dry mouth/dry nasal issues & just drink more water. Pleased with the results.,5
"I've been on Hyzaar for many years without problem and with very minimal side effects, if any at all. It has kept my extremely high blood pressure within the normal range, which is exactly what its supposed to do. Since my prescription recently expired my M.D. prescribed Losar which I was unfamiliar with...until I came here and found out its the same as Hyzaar. I do however occasionally take an additional medication as a diuretic (Lasix) because the Hyzaar doesn't seem to do the trick for me in that department anymore. Overall though I am very pleased with Hyzaar/Losar (but don't even get me started on that darn Lasix!)",5
terrible cough,5
"No reason why I was switched from Diavan/HCT which was perfectly effective except insurance wouldn't cover it. It seems less expensive, but I think it is causing me to be more dizzy & I dehydrate much quicker. ",4
persistent coughing,4
I was on the Brand of Tevetan and my doctor put me on this.  Haven't had any problems other than being thirsty.  So I drink extral fluids.,5
it has kept my blood pressure down.,5
I want a comparison to Benicar 20.  I asked my doctor to prescribe a generic version.,3
BAD Drug,3
My B/P is still to high. I am taking one LOSARTAN/HCT a day and it is 100-25MG. I am also taking CAREDILOL 37.5 per. day.  ,2
"I have been on Diovan for several years and our insurance company will not longer approve it so my doctor switched me to Losartan.  believe me, it is no Diovan. Barely lowers pressure and the hctz part makes you feel like yo have to pee all the time and you don't hardly go. I am trying to get my doctor to prescribe me something that will work.",2
".. but lately I expirience coughing after taking it, dr, x-r my lungs  , all is clear,my rx is called HYZAAR DS 100/25 LOSARTAN K/HCT, ALSO, i am  taking WARFARIN 6mg dayly,cipralex 20 mg,plus nexium 40mg , I do not know how this all works together ,I am in pain most of the time also i am supposed to have fybromyalgia, and am 76 years old.any advise?",3
"I have a bad metal taste in my mouth.. It has lowered my BP alot, down to normal range.. I also get alot of cramping in my muscles.. feel sluggish some of the time.. I sure wish the metal taste would go away...",5
"I had been taking Diovan, insurance coverage changed, had to cut dosage in half as blood pressure fell too low, trouble with urine flow, pain, coughing, swelling, and leg pain. My urine test showed nothing, but it is yellow, has strong odor and I go in spurts and no normal flow. It is no substitute for Diovan, and  I am quitting it today.",1
"i use this medicine 3 week ago i feel better,i sitesfy this effectivness.",4
"This drug has been very bad for me,very nasueasous, vomiting, very shaky and trembly",1
"I have tried various blood pressure medicines over the last several months.  I had the bad cough one, the headache one, the constipation one, etc.  If Doctors really knew the side affect they would not prescribe some of the drugs.  Been on this one about a month and what an improvement.  So side affect that I am aware of.  After about a week the medicine dropped my blood pressure down into the 'good numbers'.  My only problem is staying hydrated.  I guess it is the HCTZ but my system wants more fluids that I normally drink.  I consider this a good problem as I probably need to drink more fluids anyhow.  Good medicine for me and I would recommend you to try if the others are not bring down your pressure where you would like to see it.",5
"I have only been taking this medicine for the last two months.  I started taking lisinopril/hctz and felt extreamly tired all the time.  With the new meds I feel like 100 bucks again.  No fatigue, i did however have some feet pain in the begining but it has since subsided.  ",4
"Hydrocholorothiazide made me very depressed.  I had feelings of ""death"" hanging over me everyday. It had the same affect on my sister and my sister-in-law.  If you are taking this drug and are experiencing these symptoms. Tell your doctor you want a different drug.  He won't believe its the medication but IT IS!",1
controlled blood pressure,4
"I have recently been formally diagnosed w/ HBP even though I've been borderline for about six years. All the other meds that have been prescribed have made me feel worst than how I feel when my BP goes up, to the point where I can't proceed with my daily activities, like providing for my three kids. After a week of taking this medication, my BP has normalized. I even went a day without taking it to test its effectiveness and my BP stayed normal. Additionally, I haven't had any side effects. I am very pleased with this medication.",5
"Have been on drug several years and have constant cough. Havent seen in side effects this drug causes coughs, but am allergic to sulfa drugs. Wondering is this why cough wont go away??? Doctors dont always listen",3
Terrible metal taste in my mouth and terrible metal smell through my nasal cavity. Just awful.,4
Finally a generic for Hyzaar!,5
I was taking benicar htc for the last 4 months and it worked great but the cost was too high even with insurance. I changed to losartan-hctz100/12.5 which is the generic for hyzaar. It is every bit as effective as benicar with no side effects. My blood pressure without medication is 150/95. With losartan it runs 115/70. I highly recommend this cost effective medication. ,5
High Blood pressure,4
"incomplete bowel movements, Headaches, dizziness",4
"i have noticed that my hair has been breaking easily, its thinning really bad. I want to know if this drug causes hair loss.",4
"I have headaches, crmping in joints and legs. cough and dry throat",4
Used for fluid retention,3
This medication has lowered my blood pressure a bit...but it makes me extremely dehydrated and causes cramping in my lower back. ,4
This Medicine has reduced my blood pressure.  I have pain across my shoulders when I get up in the mornings. I have headaches and coughing.  I am going to discontinue for a while and see if this is the problem,5
"this medication makes me cough in spells,throat feels like it so dry my words will not come out.I feel like I am going to throu up and nothing comes out.My eyes water,I can't talk.",5
Makes me sleepy,4
"the cramping experienced can be overcome by taking potassiumm supplements my blood pressure has remained very good and my kidney disease (iga neorothapy) has remained in check, So far so good 2 1/2 yrs",4
not informed of oteher health problems related to this medication.,5
"This medication was very effective in lowering my blood pressure, but I experienced an unusual side effect. I suffer from back problems and this medication caused me to experience severe pain shooting down my leg. The pain was so severe I could barely stand. Once I discontinued the medicine the pain went away.",3
"I haven't been on this medication long, so I'm not sure about the effictiveness of prolonged use.  However, I have a physical job and the medication caused serious cramping (probably due to dehydration from use) in muscles.  ",4
this medication makes me cough all night long,3
Ihave used it for almost 3 years and so far this was descibed by my doctor.,5
"Used Lisinopril for years with no problem. Then it just stopped working. Was given Lisinopril HCTZ and had some issues. Finally, got dizzy spells everyday and just didn't feel good. Stopped the Lisinopril and went to another med, and things are getting better.",3
Took at night time. Could not sleep. Took during day and I am fatigued. Going to switch. It did lower 120/70.,2
Broke with blisters all over my face,1
"I took this medicine I had headaches,I couldn't sleep and my heart was beating fast.I told my Doctor she told me to stop taking it and ever since then I've been having problem with my heart",1
Day 1 severe stomach pain and diarrhea . Day 2 extremely low blood pressure 104/77 and continual diarrhea very cold hands and feet. I took htcz for two years and still had simi high blood pressure 140/95 but no side effects until the doctor added the lisonpril.. I am getting off this medication. ,1
"In less than a month, I've developed a horrible dry cough which sends me into fits of choking and gagging.  It's so bad, it wakes me up during the night.  I feel like my body is moving through quick sand.  The physical fatigue is unbearable. I also have had a low grade headache for days on end with a bit of dizziness.   ",1
"Took only one (1) 10mg pill.  My face had excessive swelling (cheeks,lips,under eyes, throat) for 2-3 days.",3
"Ok, Solved the dry cough and headaches. If you have them as I did you are dehydrated, because of the Hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic). Hydrate. You should be drinking 32 oz. plus of water just for good health. It does not make a difference whether you are thirsty or not.  You can be dehydrated and never feel thirsty. Dry cough will definitely go away and I will bet the headaches will follow.  I have never had other symptoms.",5
"I have been using this medication for a little over 90 days now. In the beginning I had some light headiness but it subsided. Now I have this God awful dry cough and can now sleep an entire 24 hours if I could. I am always tired. Now I'm having stomach pain to which I thought it was a 24 hour virus. The pain isn't as bad as it was before but it's still there. The other night I was having tingling in my foot so now I've become concerned about these side effects. If these side effects continue, I will check to see if my dosage needs to be decreased. I'm currently on the 20/25 mg one time a day dosage.",5
two plus weeks of taking this medication - have had the lowest BP reading in over two years,4
been on this for nearly 10 yrs..cannot go out in the sun break out in itchy water blisters that then leave a scar..cannot sleep ever..hair loss blurry vision..this is the only meds i take and i am asking for something else..too many warning labels and symptoms for me..,4
"On lisinopril 6 mths, coughing (bad) 5 months with no allergies or illness. Helped with BP but use several other meds such as Coreg. Weight gain and no energy. Doc pulled me off today and put me on losartan. Will see if they get a good review. ",3
do not take this drug i was on it for 1.5 yrs had ringing in the ears and lack of feeling in my feet. Have stopped taking it and have never felt better this drug is bad i felt every day i was tripping through life finally back to normal cure worse then the cause ,1
Took first pill today;-) 20/12.5htcz. So far nothing crazy. Ill update soooooon.,5
"When I took the first pill, I got a migraine and had to take a nap to try to sleep it off.  When I awoke, I was nauseous and did vomit.  I had to get my blood pressure down in one day to be able to have a tooth extracted which required a numbing drug to be administered to be able to remove the tooth. So, again I took another pill the following day before my dental appointment, and again I vomited and had a migraine.  BUT, my blood pressure went down and I had the tooth removed.  I won't take that drug again, though.  And, with the tooth removed, my blood pressure is normal to slightly high.  So, staying off the pills for now.",3
I have had no issues with this medicine outside of a little dry cough for the first week. It brought my blood pressure down wonderfully.,5
I started taking this and right away felt dizzy standing and my right arm felt tingles in it. I went around in a fog then we went to emergency room and they could not figure out what was wrong. I then called my pharmacy who told me to quit taking it. I feel much better now and going back to my Dr to get another type drug. While working out at the gym a man told me he had the same symptoms when taking it. ,1
"I have High Blood Pressure, and because my pressure was not stable with just the HCTZ, she prescribed me this medication. I have taken, as directed, for 2 weeks now, and have noticed a cough, especially at night, and slight dizziness within the first 2 hours of taking it. I check my blood pressure twice a day, and with the medication, has been normal, thank goodness, but I sit at a desk all day, and the dizziness is really bothersome.",4
"My cardiologist started me on Lisinopril for my chf when I was first diagnosed in October 2008.  Beginning with the lowest dosage, my Dr. increased my dosage incremently each succeeding year.  There were 6 month intervals where I had to stop the higher dosages for a while and then re-introduce the higher dosage.  This way my body accepted the higher dosage.  I am now at 40 mg twice daily and I feel fine.",4
"I have interrupted sleep and wake up around 2-3am and can not get back to sleep. Also, there is more confusion and some dizziness.",3
"The medication works, but it gave me terrible stomach issues from day one.  It was like having the worst heartburn ever. Also had nausea, weakness, dizziness as well.  Going back to using just Lisinopril without the added Hydrochlorothiazide. ",4
Does this medication cause weight loss?  I started taking this at the end of Sept. and it's mid-March and I've lost almost 15 pounds without changing eating habits or exercise.  It did work to lower my blood pressure.,5
"Did an excellent job of lowering my BP, but it made me feel exhausted, heavy, lethargic. Headaches and just a bit ""off"".",5
Can this med cause weight gain?  I walk 6 days a week and have not changed my diet.  I have been on this for a month,4
my only issue is a rash if i stay out in the sun - itchy and annoying for a day or two,4
"After having reasonable BP readings for years, they spiked and were in the region of 190/110 for a week.  Within 24 hours of taking this medication they dropped to 138/80 and within a few days have hovered around 120/80.  No side effects at all so far.  ",5
"I've only taken it one week, but I am extremely tired, have very bad nausea, slight headache.  Not sure if it has been long enough to make a determination.",1
I was taking 25mg and it lowered my blood pressure some.  The major thing was the dizziness and severe constipation.  My whole stomach area felt like my insides were going to come out.  It was terrible!  Had to switch meds!,1
"I've never had high BP until 2 weeks ago, an episode after serious migraine. I've had high BP only after surgeries.I developed a dry hacking cough. This medicine kinda works and now my BP is too low and that feels worse-like I'm passing out, dizzy, unbalanced on my feet. I play golf (walk the course), ballroom dance, do water exercise classes, and have never been ""off balance"". In the evening hours my BP goes back up and it's hard to get to sleep and stay asleep. If this is the answer, I'm not happy with it. I've taken it only every other day and opposite days just the diuretic alone to give my body/mind a break. Being a ""space cadet"" mentally is the pits! Researching other meds and solutions-best of luck to those that stay on it. ",3
I have been taking this drug for years and none of the side effect mentioned ever happened to me. I am surprise of this. It worked fine for me.,5
"Third medication all have made me lightheaded, dizzy but this is the worst.  The cure is worse than the problem in my view.  Think I'm going to quit the medicine and do some research  Get dizzy just turning over in bed at night, upset stomach, no energy, headaches, quiver on inside (nervous).  I think I may find a new Dr.  I don't like pill pushers.",2
I have been on this blood pressure medicine for six weeks one 20mg per day I get very dizzy in the morning when I wake up and try to get out of bed. I have a light dizzy feeling most of the day. I think I will lose weight and find more natural ways to lower my blood pressure,5
"Was on this drug for about two years and had a cough that bothered me daily, keeping my husband up at night as well as myself. A doctor I work for asked if I was on Lisinopril and I said I was.  She said that one of the lesser common side effects was a cough.  Last week started on another drug and I feel like the cough is subsiding.",3
"I have been taking it for 1 week and if I had not read the other reviews I would think I had a serious illness...I can hardly walk from the house to my car my legs are so weak and achy. Constant nausea, stomach pain and dizzy/faint feeling. I am thinking I had rather have high BP and risk a heart attack as to feel this way:(",4
"day one dizzy, tired lack of energy, headache & eye pain. I am not going to continue with this pill. Think i will try health living . I hate this medicine i cried all day depression was bad. taking 10/12.5 and my dr was me to cut them in half but i say no more.",2
"Lisinopril by itself did not control my BP, doc added HCTZ and numbers lowered.  No cough or spasms, have had some weight gain and hair loss, but not sure it is due to this drug or just the joy of aging. ",4
Was taking Diovan  and asked about something on the WalMart $4.00 list and was prescribed Lisinopril-HCTZ in the 20/12.5 dosage. This worked for about a year then my BP started to drop below 100/65. Started to take a half a pill and the BP went back to 116/72. Pulse rate stayed constant 68+/- 2 points. I have had no cough issues but just a small amount of a rash which goes away during the winter when I am indoors all the time. When first diagnosed with hypertension it was 220/115 at age 60. I am now 71 with a BP of 117/72 and feel just fine but I don't take any other medications other than the 81mg of asprin.,5
"I was on another medication for two decades that made me so tired that I refused to take it in the morning -- only at night. As a result my blood pressure was scary.  Other meds have given my migraines, so I felt there was no hope. A new doctor put me on this one.  I was not hopeful at first. In the beginning my blood pressure dropped low and made me dizzy in the morning, but it soon corrected.  I've been on it now for 5 years+ and I am so grateful to be done with the worry about my blood pressure and not feel tired.   I do tend to get the dry cough at bed time, but over time, this problem has diminished. If it ever bothers me, I use Biotene liquid, just a squirt, and I go right to sleep. I'm 65. I dance and I work full time. This medication has been a godsend for me.",5
"Shortly after starting this med I began to have episodes of itching and swellings.  My lips wound swell up or my fingers would swell and itch.  My PC said this drug had the capability of causing this problem but didn't think it was the culprit because the swellings and itching would last from one to two days then subside before returning again. My PC thought that the swellings, once present, would not subside as long as I was still taking the drug daily. After months of dealing with this, my Cardiologist, who first agreed with my PC, finally concluded that it was, indeed, this drug that I was having an adverse reaction to.  After stopping it, I had one more episode of swelling and itching before it stopped all together.  I'm now on, what my Cardiologist referred to as "" a cousin"" of Lisinopril/Hctz and was told it could react in the same way. I've only been taking ""the cousin"" for about five days and I'm hoping I have a better experience.",3
"I have never had such a bad reaction to medication as I did to this one. I was only on it three days, and thanks to reviews on this website & others I recognized quickly that I was experiencing the ""rare"" stomach problems, as well as dizziness when standing and also lightheadedness while walking outdoors. My blood pressure dropped too low the first day.  I took the first dose in the morning, by evening my stomach was upset. It got progressively worse the following day, and by that evening my stomach was distended, and my entire abdomen was very tender to the touch. I could not get in any comfortable position lying or sitting, couldn't even have clothing touching the waist area. The stomach cramps were constant and became the intensity of labor pains. The pain was horrible, and I also had light diarrhea even tho I was not eating anything but broth. The information that came with the medication listed this as a ""rare side effect"", and the nurse at my doctor's office initially did not think it was related. I mentioned my research on the internet showed it could indeed be a serious side effect, and after consulting with the doctor I was switched to another drug. When my husband picked up the new prescription, another pharmacist said that yes, some people do have that reaction. After stopping the medication, I was improving within 12 hours and recovered within 24. I had previously not had problems with either Toprol or Diazide for high blood pressure, but am having to take birth control pills for menstrual issues and that has raised my BP. This medication was listed with many more possible side effects than others I have taken, so I have to wonder why it is so often prescribed. I think it is probably that it is low cost. For me, not worth it and never again!",3
"64 years old have been on it for several years. Nurses had a hard time finding blood pressure the other day 102/60 never been that low. Othostatic hypotension , dizziness when I stand from lying or sitting position. Loss of energy, dyspnea, excessive tiredness.",4
"I started taking this medication about 7 months ago, my blood pressure fell into the normal range but I have had a horrible cough since shortly after I started taking it.  Tired all the time, vision getting worse, doctor said that it was just allergies so told me to take an allergy pill.  The coughing also has made my acid reflux worse.  The coughing is bad enough to make phone conversations for work difficult.",5

"Update from 4/18 'Took this drug ONE TIME'. Dr. is calling my experience an allergic reaction. No longer taking Lisinopril. Have been on Metformin for 3 days now. This medication is for the control of high blood sugar. I'm borderline diabetic they say. (Blood test results came back in time for my re-evaluation visit). The reviews on this med are very encouraging & so far no side effects. It's very cheap also. 4 dollars for one month. 1/'13 - weight was 230. I am 6'0"". Rode my bicycle just shy of 1000 miles that year. No weight loss in fact I gained a couple of pounds. Muscles not responding to the exercise. Extremely frustrating. How is that even possible? lol Over the winter I gained 15 more pounds. I now weigh 246lbs. Many people taking Metformin claim substantial weight loss & good results from exercise. Blood pressure down. I am very encouraged at this point.",1

"I have been on the medication for about 6 months.  While it is great for the BP my ranges are now 75-125 and sometimes lower, I have developed some chronic hoarseness that seems to be getting a little worse each day.

I started taking this about a year and a half ago. I have never been so TIRED in my life. I have no energy at all and that is not like me. My BP is down to 115 over 77 so it's working for that but considering not taking it anymore.,4
"I'm getting along fairly well w this med-Have taken it for at least 3 years. 20mgs-I'm over 70. Have developed dry eyes and dry mouth while sleeping, which I wonder if its a side effect. I have always been thin and am a fairly short female. My concierge nurse watches my kidney function every 3 mos.  So far no problem. A druggist friend suggested not to use it because I don't have any swelling anywhere in mu body. However my bp is still somewhat high: avrg 145/85 - Thank you for this website - Have used only Hydroclthz w/o lisinopril.",2
"I have been taking Lisinopril/HCTZ since July 2013.

"The company that create this drug, must remove the drug that cause dizzeness.It would be a great product.",4
racing heart light headed,3
Very satisfied with the results I just want to see the long term effects with other people that have taken this drug,5
"I start taking the Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg / 12.5 mg tablets about twenty-one days ago and I've been pleased to say; it  has helped to control my blood pressure significantly.  However, about a week ago I started experiencing severe spasms that occurs daily.  It's worse in PM when retiring for the evening, and the AM.  The spasms usually start in my toes and travel up my legs, hips, and neck.  I'm not sure if the spasms are caused by taking this prescription, or if taking it along with other prescriptions that could be causing the spasms.  I am taking 70mg of Vyvanse, 10mg Activan (only as needed), 15 mg Adderrall (as needed, usually twice a week). I don't know what is going on but it's pretty scary.",4
Lowers my blood pressure.  No side effects noted,5
"This drug should be outlawed.  I have NEVER felt like this: extremely tired, weak, weird thoughts, tingling of hands, feet, and an overall state of ""horrific quality of life.""  I know what raises my BP, and I will work to fix it without this poison.",2
"It has kept my BP in check but I get the dizziness and remain somewhat tired.  I have recently changed my job and living situation to something less stressful.    One day when I got a bad case of the dizzies after doing some yard work I checked and my BP was extremely low.  I naturally figured maybe the dosage was too high so I started taking half a tab.  All went well, I felt much better and the numbers stayed good.  Then I dropped it altogether and after a few days my BP had shot back up to the danger zone.  Apparently its effects last a while.  So I'm back to the safe region but waiting to get a dr appt here in my new location to get this back under proper control",5
"I had been on straight lisinopril, but for some reason my Dr. wanted me to switch to the combo med.  I guess it worked on the BP, but I was ""up all night"" having the most vivid and disconcerting dreams imaginable.  I felt like I hadn't slept at all when I got up in the morning.  Took the med for about 3 weeks then went back to plain old lisinopril.  ",4
This works for me for the HBP. typical side effect of frequent urnination and ED,5
My Dr. bless his soul told me because I take calan ER 240mg. to only take if my pressure is high as taking Lisinopril 10mg daily can drasticly lower my BP.so it works for me,3
"Take it for ""situational"" HBP, have experienced major hair loss and my chronic pain seems worse since I've been on it. Having more muscle aches/spasms as well as markedly increased urination:( Dr. will not change it says it's not the med, rather from stress. Strangely, things were not like this before I was put on it but that doesn't seem to matter:( Trying to find alternate ways to keep things under the 140/90 mark. ",5
I use this medication for high blood pressure control.  I previously used another medication but it caused me to gain over 15 pounds in 2 month time frame.  My doctor then changed the medication to this one and my weight went back to normal within 2 months after the switch.  My side affects are minimal although I do get the cough assoicated with taking the medication but cough drops help considerably.,5
"I was prescribed Lisinopril/HCTZ, 12.5mg tablets/once per day. My first day on it, I felt mildly dizzy and my BP dropped significantly. The 2nd & 3rd days I took half a pill, (pharmacist ok'd). Both days, within 4-6 hours after taking half/pill I felt extremely tired, where I could barely keep my eyes open.  Today (day 4) I decided  NOT to take this medication at all. So far, no tiredness.  I'm assuming this symptom was from the Lisinopril/HCTZ.  I've read all the possible symptoms. ""Feeling weak, drowsy"" is listed.  Just to clarify; I felt beyond drowsy. I had problems staying awake, even though I had plenty of sleep prior to taking it.  Has anyone else felt this way?  Thanks  ",4
i take 10 mg a day ,5
"the side affects that I have been experiencing are coughing, headaches, scratchy throat,heavy mucus or phlegm,dizziness,and sometimes a slight fever.The most annoying is when I cough it makes my head ache and I constantly have to spit out the phlegm as I do not like to swallow it.",3

Today I again threw up swelling in mouth and windpipe and lips I told benidril right away which helped I have an e- pen for the"" shell fish"" but it was near. scary I am calling the doctor on Monday I am not sure I will take anymore until then. Very bad dry skin on my legs are also a problem. I may just try change my diet instead of the drugs that are so unsafe1",3
I have taken this med. for about 6 or 7 years and worked fine until about a year ago and I started having this annoying cough. I have been to ER about 3 times as well as my physician and I have been prescribed prednisone as well as other meds and they were just a temp fix and then it all started happening again with the coughing and throat irritation. I now have a wheezing and my husband says he can hear me when I am sleeping. The cough wakes me at night and its hard to sleep. I am going to try to get something different.,3
I have been taking this for one week. Today my blood pressure dropped to 77/44 and I was weak and dizzy for several hours.,4

I had numerous bad reactions in less than 24 hours, including:dry mouth, mouth sores, somewhat swollen tongue, constant heartburn, extremely painful urination( actually painful after urination), aching kidneys, cold sweats and excessively frequent urination. I had NONE of these issues before taking this medicine, blood pressure is not even that high, Dr. put me on it as a precaution. I have not taken the medicine for 3 days, only took three times and still have terribly dry mouth and mouth sores. How long will this last? Emergency room physician tried to say I had a virus...lol If I had side effect this bad this quickly how much worse would I have gotten. Other people have described this medicine as poison, I totally agree! ",1

Bad blood test regarding kidney function. Very concerned. Related to RX ?? ,5
It worked ok for the 1st 2 months. Only real bad side effect was the heavy feeling in my chest and the horrible coughing fits.I would normally take half a benadryl with it every night to help with the heaviness. then last week i had 2 allergic reactions in a row to stuff i can normally eat and was rushed to the er. they said i had an allergic reaction to the lisinopril and changed my meds. it was scary and hope no one else experiences that. ,2

My only serious side effect has been excruciatingly painful muscle cramps/spasms in various places which have no other explanation. They were like charlie horses in my toes, under my rib cage, my left torso, right torso, under my chin. It was weird! I may pause to see if this medication was the cause, but it also seems to be decreasing.   I would give this medication 5 stars if it weren't the apparent side effect.",4
"When I first started with this medication my bp was thru the roof.In  time it has normalized my blood pressure but the side effects are  dizziness,chronic cough,frequent urination,headaches and noticeable sexual difficulties.I don't want my bp to go skyrocketing again,I'm going to ask my doctor abot something else",4

"BEWARE!  My doc changed my med from hyzaar to this medication.   Biggest mistake ever.  Within a month I was coughing non stop at night.  I was then ""diagnosed"" with GERD and given rx antacids.  Luckily  a friend told me about the coughing side effects he experienced with this medication.  Went back to the doc and he put me back on hyzaar.  Behold, coughing disappeared.  so much for the GERD diagnosis.  This is not a good medicine.   ",1
"Took this same prescription for 8 years, no problem, then changed insurance and had to change to another manufacurer and now I have coughing all the time especially at night and when I eat or drink.

"Cramps do happen from time to time with it, tho its due to lack of potassium caused by the pills.So I try to eat a banana a day. A dry cough, rather a tickle in the back of the throat (drinking something helps),and lastly being a bit more sensitive to the sun, which sucks because I already burn like crazy. Being a wife and mother of 5 and taking care of my Mother, I chose pills and the few discomforts myself. These are things I can live with vs. having high blood pressure that can cause a heart attack and other more nasty things. My Dad was on it and didn't take it the way he should have. He died at the age of 48 from a heart attack.",4
I have had consistent results with this medication. The only pesky side effect is the dizziness if I stand too quickly. ,5
ok,5
"Starting taking this when my insurance changed and couldn't avoid the brand name I was taking for over 6 years. Within 3 months my legs swelled and formed ulcers. After visiting my family Dr. and a dermatologist -3 times- I was finally told it was due to lack of blood flow in my legs, only thing different in my life was the new drug, stopped taking lisinopril and asked my family Dr. for samples of the brand name and it went away w/in 2 weeks. Unfortunately the brand name is now in manufacturers recall so now taking something else but would never take lisinopril again. Didn't see this as a side effect.",3
"Started taking about 2 months ago, the first month was fine (except for an occasional leg muscle cramp) Into the 2nd month, I developed a dry-cough that got continually worse, finally to the point of creating other problems (hernia from couching so hard!)  I only take 2 other meds so have narrowed the problem down to this one pill! Finally stopped taking it 4-5 days ago, and am slowly starting to feel better each day - what a nightmare.  FYI: For leg cramps (charlie-horses, etc.) a friend told me to get a bar of Ivory soap (!?) just for the heck of it a put a bar on my nightstand (where I get a slight whiff of it), and....amazingly, I haven't had a single muscle cramp since!!  I know, sounds like 'smoke & mirrors voodoo', and maybe it's all physiological, but it works for me!!!",3
I take a 12.5 mg. dose daily for mild hypertension resulting in occasional elevated blood pressure.  Works for me!,4
"constant headaches, lethargic",2
"Don't recall any side effects until after taking it for years it attacked my Thyroid causing massive swelling, hard to swallow etc.  Went to emergency room and they administered something that started to help.  Wanted to send me to another hospital in another city in case I needed a tracheotomy.  I refused and went home and was fine in a couple of days.  Doc said this is common with Lisinopril.  Scary having your Thyroid try to strangel you.  I'll never touch it again................",3
"Extreme lightheadedness with extreme anxiety, constant coughing.  Took 3 weeks without decrease in BP at all.",1
Took this BP med for a year and had the cough that began affecting my sleep. I also could not go anywhere without coughing my head off. I then began having the feeling that my heart was beating out of my chest and my ears would rush like my BP was up. It did lower my pressure but the side effects made it where I needed to try something else.,3
"I had to swith doctors and after taking the same med for 5 yrs my new doctor persuaded me to take this med. Big mistake I stop taking it after 4 days, I develop bronchitis and could no foucs at work. Maybe it's good for other people but not for me.",1
Caused fainting,1
"went to dr.3days ago.bp was 223/114.i have never had hbp before.really scary.dr gave me prescription for this,and sent me on to work.is this normal??? of course i dont have ins.have had a headache since taking,and a few muscle spasms.going to get a bp reading thingamig tomorrow.does anyone know the best kind to buy???",3
10 mg. does not seem to keep my blood pressure in check.,3
works well for my bp but i just got bronchitis and due to the dry cough side effect of med i can not get the mucus up ill try and deal with it but i may see if i can get a new  med which will be hard cuz i have VA heath care and it sucks  ,4
I looked this drug up because I have a cough and I don't want it.  I read the pharmacist paper and one of the side effects of one of my medications is a cough.  I'm trying to find out which one of them have this side effect.,3
"tHE SECOND DAY OF TAKING THIS MED, I HAVE LIGHT HEADINESS,SLOW AND LOW BP, ALMOST FEEL FAINT, I AM NOT HAPPY, MAYBE IT IS TOO STRONG? I AM ONLY ON THISAS I COULD NOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE MY BENACAR.",3
"I started taking this medcine about year ago and I had no idea about the side effects. I have headaches, nausea, and a bad cough. I did not even think that the medicine is what is causing my cough, and just like others it is at night and will wake me up it is so bad. I take the meds in the morning but I also have to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it seems like I urinate forever. I will be seeing my Dr and telling her about the side effects that I have been having but all in all it does control my BP. I am also tired and sleepy all the time I just feel like I do not get enough sleep, even after I have slept for 8 hours. No energy at all.",4
"I switched from Lisinopril to Lisinopril-HCTZ last week.  Since that time I have developed dizziness, weakness, concentration problems, and rash.  ",4
"I was taking Lisinopril for 10 yrs at least then suddenly at 3am I woke up with my mouth feeling strange. My lower lip was swelling up like a bad botox job. I had my husband take me to the hospital ER right away. Of course they had no clue what was going on. I called my Dr that was in AL, I moved to MS, and told the on call Dr my meds and soon as I told him Lisinopril he said that was causing it. Even though on it for years. No my husband is having same prob with his lower lip, so calling Dr tomorrow to report this. He was on this less than a yaer so he had reaction long before me, just glad it was during the day this happened. but he was saying swollowing was sort of a problem so have been watching and asking questions. But I was feeling it was the med...guess it was.",2
"The side effects chronic dry cough, headache,sweat, runny nose are unbearable. i used it for 6 weeks and went to Dr for the above symptoms 3 times and he didn't know that the drug caused it. He gave me cough syrup, inhaler ventolin and of course Steroids and no cure at all. I fired the doctor and never will see him again (was 3 years with him). He has caused me so much pain, I can write a book about it. The 20% of this drug users suffer all the above side effect.Be aware of this drug!!!!",2
"My doctor prescribed this medication to me because my BP was 209/119 with heart rate of 108.  My BP had been really bad for 2 – 4years steadily going higher and higher with heart palpitations and with my eyes sight becoming extremely blurred it was clear I needed some help.  I have now been taking this medication for 10 days with daily monitoring. My BP this morning is 122/69 and heart rate at 77.  Slight dizziness after I take it in the morning.  There is a slight urge to cough (not often thou) during the day, but am a water drinker so continuing with the water certainly seems to help.  Of course, urination but through the prior years I was retaining my water and felt extremely terrible.  I am now not retaining water weight and am so good with all of that.  Begin an exercise class of Zumba 5 weeks ago, and enjoy it immensely one hour a day – 3 days a week.  So far, I think this medication is great!  I would not want to live with such high BP that would bring side effects of stroke, heart attack and etc.  We will see what the future brings, but so far - so good. My doctor rocks and he’s the best.  ",5
"Dr prescribed this medication because my BP was 168/99. I've been taking this medication since July 2010. Stopped taking it last week and am laready feeling better. Since day one of taking it I have had a chronic dry caugh both day and night. Wakes me up every 15 to 20 minutes caughing so hard I almost vomit. Have to pee every 10 to 20 minutes. Eyes runny, sore throat, heart palpitations, feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. Very dizzy and exhausted. Was in the sun for maybe 10 minutes an just about passed out. Can not focus. Will forget what i'm saying in mid sentance. Legs hurt terribly. BP has has dropped to an average of 87/43. Just not myself anymore. Would rather have high BP than all the side effects of this medication. My DR. insists that these are not side effects of this medication. Going to see a different doctor today.",1
It has saved my life. My blood pressure rate is that of a childs. I am 53. It works devine. With no side affects.,5
"Cough, cough, cough..and almost no change in blood pressure readings before and after. I have stopped a week ago and still waiting for the cough to subside! Yuck!",1
very rapid heartbeat   coughing   tired  anxious,1
I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL OTHER KINDS OF BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS AND NONE REALLY WORKED FOR ME LIKE LINSOPRIL I HAVE HAD NO SIDE EFFECTS FROM IT AN I HAVE BEEN TAKIN IT FOR ALMOST 7 YEARS.,5
"I only took this medication for four days before flushing them all down the toilet and will never take it again! The negative side affects were immediate and constant. I was dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, had a constant low-grade headache, felt depressed, and had the memory and concentration abilities of a goldfish! I missed work, could not sleep well, coughed a lot, and basically felt ""disconnected"" from myself. I spoke with several relatives who had been prescribed this medication, and everyone of them ended up in the ER after a time because of this drug. I would rather live with the high BP (145/90) than continue to feel the way this drug makes me feel. I'm angry that my doctor would prescribe this medication; surely he must be aware of it's negative side-effects. If your doctor prescribes this for you, don't walk away; RUN!",1
"Started taking in spring of 2010.  Within a few days I had come down with a cough, sore throat, sinus problems, and allergies all at once.  Could not believe one medicine could have so many bad side effects.  Took me two weeks after I stopped taking the medicine to get over the side effects.  If you start coughing, try something else.",4
the treatment has been good,4
I've been taking this medication since May 2010. About 3 weeks ago I developed a horrible dry cough that mostly occured at night. As soon as I lay down in my bed my throat gets scratchy to the point where I start gaging. I stopped taking it last week and I am almost cough free! I can sleep again! I have a doctor's appt. next week to find a different medication for my HBP,5
i don't fell like myself and tired all the time. I have also had a heavy feel on my chest.,3
The Dr. doubled the dosage twice and I'm taking 2 other meds and it is still not under control plus I have developed a cough which is aggravating,2
I have been diagnosed with prehypertension and therefore prescribed the drug Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothizaide 10mg/12.5mg. After two months of taking the drug I have been experiencing headaches and ed suddely.  I have also experienced a low sex drive. I stop taking the drug for 3 day to see if it has gone throught my system. I'm very fustrated and just want everything to go back to normal. Going to see the doctor for alternative options.,4

I don't understand why this drastic decrease in  b/p. no other changes in meds. befor this refill b/p stable @ 120/70--130/80. I am concerned that wrong pills in right lable bottle",5
"It does what it's supposed to do, but I cough my head off.",4
Severe facial swelling first on left side then proceeded to right.  Also severe abdominal pain which prompted me to seek urgent medical attention. White and Red blood cell count significally off. ,1
I have had no real side effects and I have been only taking this drug for about 2 months now. I am very happy with this drug. I have had legs that ache sometimes but it was far worse not taking the meds. My eyes are a lil brownish at times but eye drops can take care of that. I did find out though that you have to be careful to stay cool and in not too much sunlight. To me these are small sacrifices to wake up feeling healthy. I have experienced a little dizziness but otherwise I am happy and would recommend this drug. ,4
"I have taken only two 20/12.5mg tablets in two days, (once a day) and I have already started stomach pain and diarrhea, nausea, very weak and tired, aches in leg muscles and feet and severe dizziness, so severe that I've already missed work because of it.  I stopped taking this med. and went back to taking Ziac and feel fine now.  I thought I was going to die before I could get over the side effects.",5
"ok ,would like to be drug free",4
I have been having a lot of coughing when I go to bed. Is this a symtom?,4

"This drug has lowered my blood pressure to acceptable. However, I am tired, irritable, losing my hair and some dry cough. Thought it might be due to hormone imbalance, but now am thinking it is due to this drug.",4

"Have had high BP since pregnancy five years ago.  BETA blockers were making me exhausted, so now trying this.  Not tired, but have a constant headache that no amount of water seems to help.  BP from 165/92 to 113/71 so it is doing its job.  I cough most in the evening, but drinking water helps.  I have been taking for a week, so I hope the headache issue resolves itself.  Have had similar symptoms when changing medications that improved with time. So hoping for the best.  As for sun sensitivity, it was listed as a possible side effect so I just upped the UV protection factor of my sunscreen.  ",4
"have most of the symptoms described here. horrible dry coughing jags that make me gag.hard to work that way. people look at me like i have a contagious disease or something. can't sleep at night for the coughing and gagging. legs get a crampy feeling,and have had a few charlie horses in the calves.going to the bathroom is another freak thing. i pee,but i only dribble. still have the feeling that i have to go but can't.bowels are ok.feel hateful to my family,and dog tired at the end of the work day.have shortness of breath sometimes.hips hurt when i walk too much.have stopped this as of now. will call dr. in the morning. the only good thing from it,was that it did bring down my b.p. but it ain't worth the trouble i'm having.",3
Have only taken this drug for 6 days.  I have noticed some of the reported side effects such as dry cough and headaches.  I have also noticed heart palpatations(Flutters)from day 1 to 5 (so far) and some skin over sensitivity on my chest.  Will be speaking to my doctor soon regarding my experience.,3

"I started taking in November, 2009.  Overall it worked but I ended up in the ER Sunday night with severe tongue swelling, due to a rare side effect of this medicine and of course, I am uninsured due to pre-existing conditions.  The doctor told me that you can take any meds that have severe side effects for extended periods of time without any problems and then out of nowhere, a serious side effect.  Fortunately, an IV of Benadryl and steroids and four hours later I was able to return home. My doctor switched my meds Monday morning, I will be on steroids for two more days.  Just a warning to anyone taking this, if you notice your tongue swelling out of nowhere, get to the hospital.",3
"I HAVE TAKEN FOR 2 MONTHS, AND EEMS TO HAVE CAUSED ED PROBLEMS, IS THIS A SIDE EFFECT?",4
Blood pressure was back to normal after 10 days of use. The only downside is occasional lightheaded side effect. ,5
"I developed a chronic cough while taking this medicine. The cough was debilitating and embarrassing, it would occur anywhere. I resorted to keeping cough drops with me at all times.  My Dr. discontinued this med a month ago and the coughing has stopped.",3
"side effects were nausea, tachycardia, dizziness, back pain, sever in the morning about 20 to 30 minutes after administration",4
"I was on this drug for 4 months and those were the worst 4 months of my life. Many bad side effects but the worst was the anxiety. Chronic cough, heart palputations, muscle spasms, bowel problems and the doctors are in denial. Don't take this drug.",1
BP done.....seems to have caused ED problems...Is this a sise effect?,5
I hv=ave been on this med with the Hydro for 6 years. Works great on the bllod pressure but recently I have developed a very annoying cough. ,5
"Since being prescribed this medication I have developed an irritating cough, otherwise my blood pressure is reasonably controlled.",4
I changed from another BP med to Lisinopril due to price about 6 weeks ago-for 3 weeks was well pleased with Lisinopril UNTIL the cogh started after 3-4 weeks on the med-the cough has gotten progressively worse-throat feels full. Stopped Lisinopril-after just 2 days the cough has virtually disappeared-,4
"BP dropped from 118/108 to 117/70 within 2 weeks!  Feel much calmer and more relaxed,  except for the persistant dry cough (especially at night)I am definately satisfied the this drug!",5
"changed to this mix of 2 meds and has wirked successfully, occassional cough... no other signs or symptoms of being allergic to. B/P runs about 110/65 on an daily average. The HCTZ keeps me rinnung but it is a dieuretic so it expected. Was previously on another med prior to this one and had big time lower ankles/feet swelling after 4-5 days; so this works for me fine.",5
MAKE MY THROAT SCRATCHY,5
Since beginning ths meicatin I have a persistent cough.  Repete appointments to the dctor because of a sinus infection and he i blaming it on the sinus infection isths a coincidence or ??,5
I am weak and sleepy most of the time I also have alot of muscle pain. Is this a side effect to anyone? I have only been takeng it for 4 days,5
I don't know,1
It has worked good for me in three days of use.,5
I have only been on this medication for a week now and it seems to be helping.  The one side effect that i think i am still having is the cough.  Is it time to call the doctor and discuss quitting it??,3
"I am 36 years of age. I was orginally on Lisinopril without the the Hydrochlorothiaz. That was not maintaining my blood pressure. So next I was prescribed with the Hydro... Now I am experiencing fatigue, and an excellerated heart pace when doing activies such as climbing the stairs in my home. I feel very weak and almost nervous as a result. I think this lowers the blood pressures but the side effects are difficult to say the least.",3
Does anyone know if there are side effects from the sun?  I have been getting sun burn a lot more frequently than normal.,4
i'm having some leg/muscle pains in my legs,3
Nasty Side effects - Lisinopril immediately lowered my blood pressure from 145/95 to 110/75 but after ten days caused me to constantly cough until my throat started to bleed. I was coughing so much people thought I had some highly contagious deadly disease. The severity of the coughing decrease drastically within 48 hours of halting the regieme but it took two weeks before the coughing stopped completely. When I tried to resume the Lisinopril/HCZ regime the dry coughing sideeffect started within hours not days - so my body is now hyper allergic to Lisinopril. The only good thing about this drug was that as a generic drug it was it only cost $15 for 90 days compared to the name brand ACE II inhibitor drug which costed around $60 for 30 days. ,1
"My husband always got a slight rash from this med, but last June really started bad. So he went off it, but when dr said it wasn't from the drug he started it again. same thing. Several wks ago he went off it again, but his bp went up so last night he took 1/4 pill. Today he's itching terrible again. It always has controlled his bp, even w/only 1/4 pill (10-12.5 mg). So it looks like it's the med for sure. I haven't read anyone else having this side effect. It might be that he's allergic to a filler or something?! He had no other side effects, except a slight cough sometimes.",5

I had only slightly high blood pressure, and it did bring that down.  But after the severe side effects developed: headaches, sinus problems, some swollen lips, numbness in arms and hands; but worst of all is the quick onset of terrible blurry vision.  I've quit feeling I would rather die of a heart attack than live with these symptoms.  I wish someone would write to say how long it takes for the side effects to go away.  I have no diabetes, no high cholesterol, no weight problem.  I am always avoiding doctors because it seems their prescriptions cause me to be worse off than I was before.

My average blood pressure readings over the last few months without the medication was about 130/83. The blood pressure readings over the last week have averaged about 120/72. I do not know if the difference is worth the uncomfortable feeling of slight nausea.,5

drops blood preasure too low and speeds pulse rate high,3
"Constant coughing,gagging and loss of voice.",5
Blood presure not changed,1
"The medicine is very effective in accomplishing its objective of lowering the blood pressure and swelling of ankles and feet. However, the side effects, for me, are not tolerable. I thought the side effects would go away, but I found that the occurrences increased with usage.  Side effects: Tickling,burning sensation in the throat with subsequent coughing,runny nose and watery eyes. 3 months into usage I had to stop using the drug due to the excessive coughing.",5
taking one pill a day has kept my blood pressure down somewht but it is a good worrking drug,3
"I was on a Beta-blocker (Antenolol) for high BP.  Worked well for me but I was ALWAYS extremely tired.  A friend who is a PA advised me to take an ACE inhibitor instead.  I spoke to my Doctor about it and he agreed to give it a try.  I've been on it for a month now and my BP and heart rate are normal/stable and I have a lot more energy now.  Didn't feel well the first week after switching from one to the other, but feel great now.  No noticable side effects, or cough.  Works well for me.",5
"It has been just 4 days taking this drug but headache everyday since starting. Some dizziness, a bit of a dry cough, and sort of cloudy feeling. I guess I need to give it more of a chance but headaches are terrible.I don't know yet if it has lowered my BP but I hope so. I don't want to feel this way any suggestions?",2
"I am 50 years old and now my body is changing. My Doctor put me on this med. for my symtoms. And it is working very well. Now it is up to me to eat the right foods because some foods don't work well with some meds., and get just the right amount of excercise. And stay kind of cool. I find out the hard way about needing to take care of myself. Now it seems I am 30 again. I need to say that it is very important to take this med. exactly the way the doctor ordered it to you. Don't try to cheat.",4
"I do not have the original RX bottle, and I am not sure of the dosage. The Lisinopril is a round, yellow tablet, coded B02 on one side and LL on the other. I need to know the doseage. ",3
"i am having trouble being in sun since on this medicine, break out in rash",5
This particular drug causes severe allergic reactions in African Americans. Whereas it is beneficial in small dosages once you are taking more than 40mg you can risk a severe anaphylactic shock response including swollen tongue and throat,3
"Was satisfied with this drug until reading reviews. I have the cough, the burning itching rash on my arms, the tingling and numb fingers, the leg cramps and the spasaming abdominlal cramps. Symtoms that I've had for years and didn't dawn on me that could be from taking this drug. Am going to my Dr. and find something else.",4
"I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about four months ago and was first treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone and my blood pressure would be down one week and back up the next.  My doctor then switched me to lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide and I have had good pressures ever since.  My blood sugars were just at the border of being on the high side and my weight has always been a problem since I was a child, so I am trying to stick to a 1200 to 1400 low carb low fat diet also.   This has been a challege for me on top of stop smoking.  I have always been a pretty healthy and active person.  I love to bake and cook for my family and its hard not to taste those goodies I send home with the grandkids. On the same token I know I must do this in order to be around to see the grandchildren grow up.",5
Would you rather hurt or die? I was on Lip only and my blood pressure stll would not come down and in one day it was down to normal.  Of course I'm not on a lot of meds.,4
"This drug delivers on lowering blood pressure quickly.  I went from 150s/90+s to 120s/70s within days.  The cough/dry throat side effect is bothersome, but goes away after a few months.  Having cough drops on hand took care of it until my body could adjust.  I also highly recommend Ayr saline nasal gel to stop the dry sinus side effect.  It works great at bedtime when cough drops aren't practical.  Dealing with a dry throat is uncomfortable, but I'll take that over a stroke, heart attack or kidney failure any day.",5
"After reading so many negative comments here about this drug, I think I will do what I usually do and not take drugs if there is any choice. My dr only mentioned a cough as side effect, none of the multitude of the others listed here. I now plan to lose about 20 lbs and walk more and try to eat better. I would advise it for others. Thanks for the information here.",1
"I was on Diovan, I lost my job and had to go to my husbands insurance, the price of the Diovan went from my 25.00 copay to 75.00 copay.

"This medication gave me symptoms of extreme reflux. Had to stop taking, because symptoms and pain was so bad I could not even drink water without it causing symptoms.  Doctor took me off.",1
Makes me light headed fill like Im in a cloud. I think it messes with my vision,4
"My doctor placed me on this med & after two months I returned to him and informed him that I had a ""tickle"" in my lower throat & thus a cough was triggered.  This became constant thruout the two month period.  He immediately took me off the drug.  Drug not worth the cough that you get.",1
"My husband was on 10mg once a day simvastatin 20mg once a day. He developed a dry persistent cough, dark urine and an one time brief tremor in his left hand along with fatigue. I read the web med reviews and took him off linsinopril but the cough is persistent and the dark uring.

I ALSO TAKE MEDICINE FOR OSTEOPORSIS, FIBROMYALGIA/INNER EAR, SINUS DRAINAGE AND INDIGESTION/HEART BURN.  I ASSUME THE LISINOPRIL/HCT IS MIXING O.K. WITH THE OTHER MEDICATION. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MEDICATION, JUST WONDERED ABOUT THE DRY COUGH?????",3
"Am taking this with low dose HCL and it has been very effective in lowering BP. Took a month to get used to and I find taking it at night really helps with dizziness, fatigue. Still experience daytime dizziness (occasional) -- and some hair loss which could be symptom of something else but it is listed as infrequent side effect.",5
"Aside from a little dizziness the first few days, no side effects--however, no benefits, either.  Even with tweaking the dosage and adding a beta blocker, no change in my numbers.",1

Dry mouth, sweating, diarrhea, leg cramps, severe dizziness, cold clamy feet, cough that is very bad at night. A month ago my doctor thought I was having panic/anxiety attacks and treated me with medication for that. I was not satisfied with this remedy so I had researched Lisinopril and found that most people had the same reactions as I did and were too treated for anxiety.

Unhealthy feelings, nausea.Cough causes sleeping difficulties.Feelings of fatique,slight dizziness/groggyness.Frequent urination. Body action rejection symptoms. This product may work but side effects I have experienced not worth the benefit. Concerns of self poisoning with product by body side effects response to it. I question whether risk is worth reward on this combo product. Blood pressure and heart beat out control last few years but at least felt healthy without product. It is no fun feeling sickly taking it. HDC did not work alone with me. Combo of two might be, to soon to tell, however both drugs combined are doing little or nothing with racing heartbeat situation. Taking this two-drug combo concerns me as much as having high blood pressure and not being able to do anything about it. An aging problem I guess we all must deal with somewhere down the line.Summation: To many negitive side effects between the two drugs. Will seek other options from doctor. The smoker's cough/dry heaves and nausea alone will make you want to discontinue this blood pressure treatment. Still on treatment and not a happy camper. What to do?   ",4

Discharged on same new BP meds Lisinopril-HCTZ 20/12.5mg 1 in am and Amlodipine Besylate 5mg -1 in pm. Both are new for me (starting 2nd wk).

I did not read side effects and warnings until 5th day to make sure any effects were the medicine and not me just thinking I had side effects.  ",5
"I have this dry coughing that wakes me up in the night, I am not able to sleep, can't even go out anywhere not event to church because the coughing is so bad, I can hardly work  during the day, the coughing is painful and my neck muscles throat stomach is sore from this coughing",4
Medication doesn't work well for ethnic back grounds/blk women/rare side effects not listed it will swell your intestine and make it feel like some thing is twisting inside.,2
"Started at 20mg for a few months, lots of peeeeing and dizzy in hot weather, then 10mg, now trying 5mg.... drops the bp like a rock.",5
I was on benicar hct but doctor had to change to generic olmesartain.  Not sure if this medicine is making be have dizzy fainting spells.  Has anyone else had these issues?,3
Blood clot,2
Massive hair loss from this stupid drug!  Was on Benicar with no side effects and doctor decided to give me the generic.  Wow!  This same thing happened when I took Atenolol and I had to fight to get another drug. Doctor kept saying it was probably hereditary and I argued until I got the Benicar.  Then they went and changed it.  Going back on Benicar now.,4
Doctor advised to the drug for controlling high blood pressure.urine released frequently.There is no side effect seen.,3
"I have been taking Benicar HCT for a few months now. My blood pressure before taking it was around 148/95. Now, after a few months it stays around 90/70 and when I drink alcohol, it shoots up to about 138/80, then back down the next day. This drug is easy to take (orally), only one a day. I'm on the 20/12.5. I don't like taking medicines because of side effects. However, this one had no side effects on me. I highly recommend for high blood pressure. ",5
"side effects are now showing up, kidney failure",4
the real reason I asked my doctor for help was my swallen feet. After taking this medication my feet went back to normal. thanks.,3
"I have been using this pill (20mg/12.5mg) for high blood pressure and w/in a few days the headaches I was having ceased and my blood pressure finally was in the ""normal"" range. Prior this taking this medication my average blood pressure was high (180/145, 170/160, 150/120 ... ect). The only thing I dislike about it is that I am only 28 yrs old and want to have start a family, which means I will have to switch and pray that the next pill works as good! ",5
My Doctor told me to take one quarter of 1 pill to start and even with that small of a dose my heartrate went up to 110 beats per minute-not good!!! Will discontinue use.,1
"I had experienced moderate swelling in my face, hands, legs and feet.  I saw almost immediate results. I  can now stand without my feet, waist, side & back literally hurting due to the large amounts of fluids I was retaining.  It is very easy to take .",5
I didn't realize until I went to my doctor that the cough I have is a side effect.  He realized that it started about 2 weeks after I stared the Quinapril. Not a happy camper at this point as this was a replacement drug from my pharmacy because of insurance changes.,3
I took this drug 4 days - only to realize the dry coughing I was doing night and day was a side effect!  I am a singer.  The coughing not only kept me from singing - it kept me from sleeping!,1
Ive only been on it for 5 days.  My blood pressure is now normal.  I have notice light sensitively in the mornings and I just dont feel great.  Im gining it the 2 weeks in hopes to feel better.,5
I was prescribed both Inspra and Coreg for congestive heart failure about 7 years ago. Tests every six months show improved heart muscle and blood flow. Echos show much improved regurgitation factor. Cardiologist very pleased and so am I. I have no side effects whatsoever even though I am currently on 14 different prescription meds for a variety of health problems.,5
this drug is very good at what  it is used for,5
"After many years unable to completely control either blood pressure or low potassium levels, my PCP testing my aldosterone/renin ration, which was through the roof.  She referred me to a nephrologist, who pressribed this.  Virtually a miracle drug.  K levels almost immediately moved to the middle of the normal range, and BP responded accordingly.",5
"Like another reviewer, I have elevated aldosterone levels that increased my BP. Been on the generic equivalent for several years now.  This medication has worked well for me. 100mg/day.",5
been on 100mg per day has not helped blood pressure so far bu has now been increased to 200mg per day from today will see how it goes i also take other kinds of bp tablets at the same time ,1
"At times my breasts gets very sensitive and itchy, especialy the right breast. Nipple and breast enlarge slightly at times. Some med.refills have no side effect and others do.",1
"caused fast heartbeat, dizziness, diarrhea,muscle aches, tiredness, nausea, loss of appetite, heaviness in legs when getting out of bed.  stay away from this med",1
Along with 3 other drugs my blood pressure doesn't spike now and stays in the 120/75 range (for the most part) since I started using this drug.  However muscles ache and breasts are sore but much better than using sprinolactone so I guess I can't complain!,4
swelling of my breast,4
"It has helped the blood pressure which has been extreme but the dry mouth,lips,eye at night especially intrrups sleep",3
"This medication is being taking for irregular heartbeat and works. However the side effects are not pleasant i.e.muscle weakness, dry mouth at night vision deteriation and fatigue.",4
This medication in a relatively strong dosage has been highly effective in reducing sodium levels and increasing potassium levels. There is a medical term for this but I forget it. My kidney doctor has used it successfully for many patients.,5
"I have problem with over production of aldesterone in the adrenal gland, this caused extreme high blood pressure. Had other drugs first with lots of side affects. After starting INSPRA no side effects feeling better than ever and blood pressure to normal. This treatment will be for life.",5
"Light headed (as opposed to dizziness), weak and fatigued 100% of the time. Loss of muscle strength. ",1
"Took Inspra for 1 month after my heart attack, no problems. My cardiologist said it was most effective for the first 30 days after a heart attack, but not a long term drug regimen",4
"after taking this medication for several months I became extremely ill, so dizzy and ill feeling that I could not stand or funtion. Hoarse. Doctors ran emergency tests on my pacemaker and heart but found no problems. Tried a medicine for iner ears problems but that was not working even after 2-5 day treatments. Finally stopped Inspra because it was the last medicine perscribed and within 36 hours I was fine and have remained fine ever since. Was on Inspra once before several years ago and had problems with hoarseness and sore breasts (I'm a man) and quit then for those reasons but was told the drug had been improved. I will never take it again.",1
serve reaction while working with drug.  Have to care an epic pen at all times,1
this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,3
My doctor told me this drug has been discontinued and prescribed another medication.,5
THIS MEDICATION HAS KEPT MY BLOOD PRESURE IN CHECK FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS.,5
"At first lisinopril worked good. No side effects. After about 2 months I began to have angry thoughts -violent thoughts - suicidal thoughts. Then I had sleep issues. Still can't sleep with out help. When I told the doctor, he didn't blink. He had heard these comments before. He said take more. No thank you. I'm out. EV",3
pressure goes from 130 in morning to 200/90 at night,1
Worst prescription drug EVER!!! 6 months of HELL! Not just for me but many of my friends that were on it! 40 and feeling like your 90 something. Swollen tongue..could barely talk...exhausted like I ran 50 marathons every day. Sore throat that never went away no matter what I did. I thought my life was over. 2 days after going off it felt like a million dollars! NEVER ever again! Stay away from this one.,1
"Best snake venom ever.. I had extremely high blood pressure, 200 / 120 and with just 2.5 milligrams, I am off and running.. Have only been taking for 3 days but have experienced no side effects except s slight dizzy feeling which is normal for most blood pressure meds.. I would recommend this drug to others...",5

"i have only been on this Medicine for about 6 weeks and other than a rare dizzy spell standing or sitting to quickly, I have had no other effects at all.Only on 10 mg's and  B/P is great. Hoping the doctor will go down to 5 mg's. Sister takes it also and no side effects for her either.",4
"At first i felt good but the longer i took it the more issues i had. Started with the cough and the flem, moved on to feeling some what tied and lethargic.  Got to the point i felt like i had a light hangover all the time. Had to push myself to do day to day work. After walking i would feel tired and a bit shakey. Not to the point of actual shakes, but a bit unsteady. My head felt heavy inside. My body felt tired no matter the amount of time i slept.",4
"hair loss, do not take this drug, per side affects.",1
"I was prescribed this drug for borderline high blood pressure. After taking it for a few days I developed a cry cough, lost my voice, was dizzy, nauseated and so tired I only wanted to sleep.  Impossible to drive. When I checked the side effects I just went down the list checking every one that was listed.  Although I was only on it for a week, the cough and loss of voice has continued. Now I'm afraid to try another medication for the blood pressure.",2
"I havve borderline high blood pressure.  I experienced no negative effects from lisenopril.  I had heard about the cough that was possible to develop, but thankfully this did not occur.  I have not noticed that it causes drowiness for me, though I only take it at night.  ",4
I started taking this drug at the end of September 2016. I had the first instance of the worst abdominal pain I'd ever experienced within the first month. The first episode only lasted about ten minutes but subsequent episodes lasted longer until on the 3rd of January 2017 I ended up in the ER. Diagnosis was acute Pancreatitis. Supervising physician didn't think it was caused by this drug but the gastroenterologist who was consulting listened to me and switched me to amlodipine. My white blood cell count began to drop and I was released on the 8th of January. Haven't had anything like it since.,5
"The first day I started taking this I developed a dry cough and fatigue. Soon I didn't have a voice, was depressed, so tired I couldn't do anything but sleep. Finally after a week I looked up the side effects of it and went down the list. I had every side effect that they had listed.  Not a good experience. ",1
"Been on Lisiniprol for almost 3 years. Always had a cough I just thought I had allergies.  After talking to other people that had been on it, I finally figured out why I was always thirsty and the last few months the cough got so bad it affected my life in every aspect including work.  My shoulder blades and ribs hurt so bad because  of it. My voice changed very raspy. About 3 weeks ago I lost my voice completely for 4 days. This has happened to me 5 times in 3 years.  I finally figured why all this happened. Got off it asap.  If you start coughing get off if it.",5
"I'm thinking I am not getting better from my three stents, I'm sick with a cough, not one person has good reviews????  Despicable doctors to even prescribed this after looking at this blog. ",1
"I had the aforementioned Severe Allergic Reaction.  This very rare condition is common enough that the ER staff IMMEDIATELY said ""oh, we know what this is.""  The ER doctor called up the drug on a search engine, clicked 'images,' and showed me dozens of pictures of others with the exact same symptoms.   This was extremely frightening, and this reaction seems much more common then Extremely Rare.  This non-medical professional recommends looking for an alternative.",2
"Doc kept increasing dosage.  Presently on 40mg 2x daily.  Now have scleroderma, a rare autoimmune disease.  Anyone elseâ??s got the same problem?",2
Lisinipril had the terrible side effect of a dry hacking sporatic cough.  Had to keep sucking on cough drops while I gave it two weeks to work.  The cough seemed to get worse over the few wks.  Dr changed med immmediately.,3
My pressure was 140/80 with a mild headache a couple times per day. Started this medication and headaches increased severely making me cry and I became very tired by end of day with pressure increasing to 165/90. bad deal for me went back to previous medicatin,1
"Been taking for a number of years. May be losing effectiveness due to changes in diet, age, weight, cholesterol. ",3
This medication worked well at lowering my blood pressure however the side effect of a persistent hacking dry cough was unbearable and continually caused a sore throat. ,3
"I've been taking lisinopril for about 3 months. Blood pressure is normal but the gagging cough is too much. The lack of sleep and dry mouth are also pushing me over the edge. Called dr. today, we'll see what the new drug brings.",4
"I have been taking this for 5 years and I have experienced nosebleeds and fatigue. Within the last 6 months i have been getting headaches, spikes in blood pressure, dizziness, and blurred vision",2
"I've used it for 15 years or more. Just had an ""angiodema"" which sent me to the emergency room. My lips and cheeks swelled up. It was treated with antihistamines and steroids. I was told to stop taking lisinopril which is an ""ACE inhibitor"" which can cause angiodema.I did have a few previous cases of angiodema which were mild and easily treated. My doctor at that time did not know what was causing the swelling. I am now taking a different medication, not in the ACE inhibitor class.",5
"I took 20mg 1x/day for about 2 weeks. Initially it seemed to be working well. At about 1.5 weeks I started having blood pressure spikes in the 170/110 range with a feeling of pressure in my head and ears, and a feeling like someone was continuously sqeezing my neck. The doctor added Norvasc but 3 days later my pressure spiked to 180/115  with my left arm getting weak and numb. I had to stop the Lisinopril for 6 days for several tests. The morning after I started back on it I experienced the same issues again when I had been feeling better. The reaction I was having is known as Angioedema ... essentially an allergic reaction to ace inhibitors which is the class of drugs Lisinopril is in. I am now taking 10mg Norvasc 1x/day and am feeling better.",1
I took 20 mg per day for 3 years with little to no effect on BP. I tried 40 mg for 30 days with no effect. BP was the same with or without taking this drug. ,1
"I was on Lisinopril 40 ml for 3 moths. It worked great for lowering my blood pressure. It went down from 180:100 to 110: 70. I had to stop it because the side effects. I lost my energy, I started forgetting everything, started feeling calm and kind of depressed, acting like a zombi. I lost my interest to my job, to everyday routine. I worked like a robot. My kids started asking me: Mom, whatâ??s wrong with you?But my blood pressure was perfect. I decided to stop taking it without my doctor advice, put myself on diet and started taking my grandmaâ??s old fashion remedies. My babysitter also was on Lisinopril 20 ml for 5 years. It worked good for her until it stopped working and her blood pressure went up and she passed away while slipping at the age of 63.",2
I have been taking this medication for two weeks with great results and only a slight cramping in my stomach on three different days for approximately ten minutes. BP has gone from 169/101 to an average of 134/78 for the past 5 days.,4
"Started Lisinopril on Christmas Day and over the course of a month my bp went from 160/90 to 123/71 with no side effects to speak of. Got a refill (different manufacturer) and within 2 days started having a terrible cough, problems breathing and after a couple more days had a paralyzed throat and was unable to swallow. Bad feeling!!! Took two rounds of Benadryl to counter the allergic reaction and stopped Lisinopril altogether. Went a week without meds and bp shot up to 150/102. Just started Amlodipine. Note that I'm a new bp patient so we're still searching for what works...",3
20 MG NEVER DID LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE,1
I was only on this medication for two weeks 10 mg. The coughing was terrible. I stopped 4 days ago . Feeling a bit better. Never again.,1
Made me cough horribly for weeks until I stopped taking it.  The doctor did not tell me about this possible side effect so I had no idea when I was coughing/chocking.  It was a fluke that I figured out it was this drug.,1
Created a terrible side effect of a very persistent cough nasty enough that it affected me conducting business and being able to sleep lying down... was on it for 5 months thinking the cough was caused by something else.  Stopped taking it and 3 days later the cough was 100% gone. ,1
"Lisinopril 40 mg manufactured by Lupin is not effective at all for me.  It is as if I took no medication at all.  This problem is ONLY the lisinopril manufactured by LUPIN.  Other manufacturers I have no problem and the drug works effectively.  Unfortunately, Lupin is the cheapest manufacturer so that is what is most commonly supplied.  If you take lisinopril manufactured by Lupin monitor you blood pressure.",1
"While it did lower blood pressure,  it also caused a blood clot in the lungs,  a fast heart beat problem (pulse = 160/min),  turned my bowel movements to chili consistency (took a year of no lisinprol use to correct) and gave me such lethargy/malaise that I felt like doing nothing.  Overall,  avoid like the plague.  Unfortunately the high blood pressure fixation by medical world is a financial scam and they make its treatment a gateway to get other treatment you actually do need.   An outrageous practice by the medical world.",4
"Used this medication for a very short time and developed a chronic dry cough.  Once discontinued, cough slowly went away.",1
what other meds are out there  that come close to lisinopril ilike lisinopril  please tell me what they so i can ask my dr if he may could itfor awhile for me,4
Works for me; no side effects.. Significant blood pressure drop. ,5
"I have been taking Irbesartan for 3+ years, but had pain and swelling of legs and ankles so starting this year Dr. switched me to Losartan. I also had occasional dry cough all along so to see if it made any difference he switched me a few months ago to Lisinopril 40mg and the cough got worse! Switched back to Losartan as pharmacist says it is next gen drug better than Lisinopril. Ok so cough almost gone. Note: All drugs have side effects, even if by a small %. No Dr. or Pharmacist or Drug maker will tell you everything you need to know. You are not just a statistic filed with the FDA. Go back to nature!",1
"I took this medication for at least two years. It did a great job of managing my moderately high blood pressure, but it gave me a dry cough. The cough wasn't too bad until I compounded it with a viral illness - after that my airways were raw, my mouth burned, and I lost my sense of taste. I stopped taking it two months ago - my mouth feels quite a bit better and am just starting to get my sense of taste back. I would take it again because it was so effective but the side effects are too much to bear. ",5
"Story. i had a severe chemical sensitivity to my hands,skin would crack long time to heal. Only drug that would help was prednisone. Had taken it for 22 years. 3 months after taking lisinopril i no longer take pred. Skin problem with hands has disappeared now for 3 years.   ",3
"I was put on this medication 2yrs ago for HBP. Yes it helped bring my pressure down, but I am finally convinced it is the cause of my many terrible symptoms. I believe it has been slowly poisoning me. Itchy skin and strange hives that I thought were spider bites, swollen watery eyes, a sun burned feeling under skin, electrolyte problems, cramping in legs, feet and hands, headaches and extreme exhaustion. today was my last dose. Never again.  I will go natural and cut out all sugar, gluten, walk, yoga and breathing exercises.  I am very upset with myself that I stayed on this awful drug for so long. It only gave me an excuse to not try harder and it was debilitating. I believe I was on the verge of a life threatening allergic reaction.  Oh and of course I had the Lisinopril cough like so many.  It is sad that we end up in desperate situations and have to go this route sometimes, but I believe this drug is ONLY  meant for a short term in order to buy time in getting the weight off or eating better, more exercise etc. Otherwise it will eventually cause terrible damage.  I wish everyone luck with whatever your choice but I have done a lot of research and I am convinced this is a very bad choice and extremely dangerous. I sure hope these terrible symptoms go away!",3

I thought it was something else until this last weeek I had to be admitted to the hospital.  Come to find out that every single side effect that this drug has, I had.  I have talked to my Dr. about putting me on a different med for my issue.  If this happens to you it might be the meds that you take and not you personally.",5
"I began using Lisinopril 10mg for high blood pressure about two years ago when my dr said it was the least likely of BP meds to cause liver damage. In December of last year I began having an intense rash on my body, which I attributed to something else initially. In addition, since using the med I have battled with lots of phlegm. I had also begun experiencing extreme muscle pain in my right leg but I was on a statin drug at the same time for high cholesterol, so the dr thought that was what caused this problem. However, while the muscle pain greatly diminished after I went off the statin, the muscle problem did not go away entirely. I still had fatigue and muscle tiredness while on this drug. I went off this med a week ago. I have gone on another bp med (amlodipine 5mg twice a day), but I am finding it is giving me negative symptoms too, but at least the body rash and leg muscle pain is much less on this med. However, the face and leg heat/flushing and extreme fatigue are worse. My dr is changing my med again; this time it will be Benicar, but I am concerned after reading there are a lot of lawsuits against its manufacturer. It makes one think high blood pressure may be the lesser of the many evils but my father had a heart attack at my age so......",4

Extreme pain in legs and  cramping in feet and legs.  Went off and witin 2 weeks all the pain from the many months prior stopped.  Unforunately the swelling/cramping in the feed caused what appears to be permanent damage.  Swelling was not viewable but dr said it was from potasium build up which caused the pain and damage,4
Though taking 40 mg has decreased my BP into safe levels the chronic cough is awful.  It took five weeks of 27/7 coughing finally realize the cause of the medication.,4

"This is an ACE inhibitor, a class of antihypertensives loved by MDs for no good reason.  Like all approved antihypertensives,  ACE inhibitors lower BP, but that is not enough.  Unlike thiazide diuretics  & beta blockers,  ACE inhibitors do not reduce the risk of death or heart attack  unless they are taken in combination with a thiazide diuretic and/or beta blocker.  The best case for the effectives of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of death/heart attack  is a 2014 meta-analysis study.  The stistician who invented meta analysis used to work for me.  We talked a lot about meta analysis.  In the end, neither of us ever used it our own research  because we could never conclude that a meta analysis was believable.    I have hypertension, and I would fire any MD who wanted to prescribe an ACE inhibitor as the only drug to take  & look for an MD who knew what he was doing and prescribed  1) thiazide diuretic, 2]  and/or a beta blocker, 3]  both the above plus an ACE inhibitor  which will further  increase the reduction in risk of death/heart attack    Antihypertensive drugs are approved by the FDA if they reduce blood pressure, but you do not want to lover your  blood pressure.  You want to reduce the risk of death/heart attack  that comes from high BP, and not all ""effective""  antihypertensive drugs do that.",3

"I was on this for about 3 months.The dry nagging cough was the least of my problems. I had a general feeling of the flu. I couldn't sleep, yet I couldn't get out of bed. Confusion, dissiness, feeling of distress. I went back to my doctor, and he changed meds to something that begins with A and hydro something. Back to this med. I got blood work done in his office. He sent me results with a comment That my sirum ALT had doubled and to cut down on drinking. Strange I thought. Moderate drinker, unchanged. 6 month later I just got new blood work. He sent me both my last and new labs. My sirum ALT went from 68 (high) to 33 (normal). This drug was killing my liver! Read side effects. The other drugs have equally horrable but different side effects. I'm 58 and a workaholic. I'm going to take my chances with stage 2 hypertention because the treatment is worse than the desease.",1
"I take 10 mg. lisinopril 1 x daily. Effectively controls blood pressure. Doctors had me on hydrochlorothiazide for 1 year with no results before switching me to lisinopril, and now I feel better and confident that medication works for me. I do experience fatigue, but the fatigue is tolerable knowing that my medication works effectively and helps me to live longer.",5
"within a week bad stomach pains, loss of control of bladder, black stools and hallucinations... came off it as soon as I realized it was responsible... took a few weeks for symptoms to go away... a bad drug for me.",1
I was doing fine on 50mg/day. Then the manufacturer changed the shape and color and my bp went out of control. Now taking 100mg twice/day and still having major spikes in bp. My doctor says keep on taking it. Should I insist on trying something else.,1
I've only been taking this drug for 2 weeks and have developed the severe cough that almost everyone is referring to. So severe to the point of gagging. I do not recommend this drug. I will stick with my Atenenol. ,1
"In the brief time I used this medicine I didn't have any coughing, but I did have several instances of angio adema (swelling of hands, feet, and or face/mouth. Myyyyy doctor took me of immediately.",2
Before starting BP was consistently around 175/105. About a week in dropped to 112/78. Been taking 10/12.5 mg for over 2 years. I've reduced my intake to one pill every other day and it's still working fine. No cough - no dizziness.,5
Not only unhappy with lisinopril but unhappy with the doctor for not taking me off this med sooner when I reported chronic coughing.     ,1
"I switched to lisinopril from hydrochlorothiazide a month ago because of the severe side effects from hydrochlorothiazide. I took 5 mg daily in the evening. It took about a week to take effect, but it worked very well on my BP (110-120/70-80). However I have developed a bad cough. My doctor is switching me to losartan.",5
Took a while to get used to the tiredness and fatigue but the drug has caused blood pressure and a fib to be very regulated. ,5
I started having a chronic cough and didn't realize this is a side effect of this drug.  Extreme dry mouth as well.  Don't want it,3
"Taking since 2009, bp 140/89.  Now avg 120/72.  Also wish to add that diet has changed ",5
After 2 weeks on this drug stage 3 gfr kidney failure.  No problem previously.,3
"Worked great to lower my blood pressure, but the side affects were another story. I had dizzy spells, chest pain, and a very dry mouth. Talked to my doctor to recommend another medicine since I couldn't deal with all the issues. ",5
"Went from 5mg to 10mg to 15mg. No help to blood pressure. Starting some new kind tomarrow. Bad side effects. Cronic diarea, cotton mouth , dizzy, lathargic. As soon as I stopped, conditions went away. Better to take this med in daytime because of side effects. I opperate heavy machenery. I can't deal with it.",1
"End of May 2016 I was in the ER and diagnosed with Essential Hypertension (age 36, male). I used to one energy drink a day along with other caffeinated beverages, and smoked/vaped(with nicotine) for about 10 years, as well as drinking way more than my share of alcohol every week/day/night (12pack easy).   I quit alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine all in one movement after that ER incident. Two more times in the ER realized I had a ""hot tooth"" that could not be touched by any type of painkiller due to the massive inflammation. Timeline is critical here now.  After the third time in the ER I was setup with a PCP to be seen in about 10 days, as I did not have one before. I also had a root canal scheduled from an endodontist in 22 days.   Went to my new PCP on day number 10 and he wanted to put me on 20mg Lisinopril-HTCZ (the one that makes you go pee in 30 mins after you take it).  Also switched to a low sodium diet, and stopped eating out. Started exercising (walking) 1 mile or more a day. Began noticing the numbers starting to creep back up and also having extreme cramps in my calves and thighs while walking. I let my PCP know and he switched to the non-HCTZ Lisinopril 20mg.  This is where stuff got weird. Went to the endodontist had my root canal, and BP dropped immediately overnight to a normal safe non-Essential Hypertension level, as I track it everyday. Then progressively as the days went on it creeped back up.   I was unable to sleep in bed lying down anymore due to strange palpitations that didn't register on the BP monitor. Spasms in muscles mainly at joints. Prickly tingly pains like leg went to sleep in foot, hands, and forearm (parasthesia).   Went back to PCP about 4 months into treatment with Lisinopril with a 167/91 that had multi-symptom (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, spasms, insomnia, irregular heartbeat).  I am now on Amlodipine Besylate 2.5mg (Norvasc) with great returns so far. Lisinopril was the worst summer of my 36 years ever.",1
"I've been taking for about 6 months.  20mg at first, strong dizzy episodes, was lowered to 10mg, occasional dizzyness, but hands/arms feel cold even though the rest of me is warm. 5mg now, still cold hands/arms and side pain, get light dizzyness when I stand or lay down, will ask for another medication next visit.",5
"I began taking a month ago, went off mitropilol as I though fatigue was an issue. My face, particularly my cheeks are red, and broken out.  There are blemishes almost like a slight rash- anyone else experiencing?",3
"For the longest time I have had extreme fatigue, diarrhea, leg cramps mostly at night, dizziness when coming up from bending over, weakness in my arms and legs, achy feet and joints. I researched this med and will now ask my Doctor to change or stop taking it all together. I'm thinking a more natural way to control high blood pressure.Loosing weight, exercising, and relieve stress by having fun.    ",3
"I've been using this medication for about 5 years. This medication works wonderful keeping my blood pressure under control however, within the last year I've started developing a common cough and, I've NEVER had a cough as such especially when I experience laughter. Nothing's perfect but, hopefully my Doctor can prescribe me a new blood pressure brand medication without this coughing side affect.",5
"I've been on this medicine for about five years.Great medicine.However,I've started getting side pain for last six months .",5
My cardiologist started me on Lisinopril lowest dosage when I was first diagnosed with chf October 2008.  My dosage has incremently been adjusted over the years until my body has been able to accept the higher dosage I am now taking of 40 mg twice daily.  I feel fine.,4
"started with 10mg, then was raised to 20 mg, after 1 year now suffering from headaches muscle pain, weakness and fatigue, also stomach issues now dr has decreased back to 10 mg, can't wait to switch to another bp medicine",5
Had such bad fatigue I had to start taking at 5pm so I could work. I have weak vein syndrome and this am woke up with a large purple bruise & soreness on my bicep after light weight lifting yesterday. Also have had swelling in ankles at the end of each day. ,5
works great  maintaining  blood pressure,5
"Within 6 days of taking this drug, I developed a severe cough. The cough lessened, but then my intestines were not working right.  I ended up in th ER with severe rectal pain. Drs. said I had a hemmorhoid. I have been taking 400mg of magnesium for 6 months prior to this, so constipation was never an issue, and the pain was so severe I could not function. After visits to  different doctors and no relief of the pain, I consulted a surgeon. When he examined me, he found I had an internal anal fissure with intestinal swelling. I stopped taking the drug lisinopril and my intestines are back to normal with NO pain.",2
"Cold extremities, achy, general feeling of 'not being myself'...had been on it previously for about 5 mos, quit for about 3 months, felt great, but BP spiked so trying again. Had been given another med to take with this but I'm not going to overdo the meds. Will see how this does this time. If a no-go I'll dry meditation and beet juice (supposed to lower BP).       ",3
"After only one week at 10 mg/day I experienced leg, ankle, and feet swelling. Extreme fatigue. Body stiffness and all over pain. Headache and scratchy throat. Dizziness.  Two weeks after I stopped taking this med, I was almost back to ""normal.""",1
"Been on this med 10  years at 10mg/day with no side effects. In 2014, I experienced intense BP spikes 2-3 times a week, primarily at night - highest being 220/110. Clonidine 0.1mg  brings it down in an hour. Had EKG done, with no heart abnormalities but no diagnosis for the spikes.  After three months symptoms suddenly stopped as quickly as they started, and I went back to normal readings (for me, anyway). Two months ago the spikes started again. Cardiologist upped dosage to 40mg/day and BP is still not in an acceptable range - in 140 to 170 over 85 to 100 range.  Thankfully, spikes are not as high as in 2014.  I live alone and am wondering if this could be related to anxiety.  Any similar experience out there?",3
"Works great for reducing BP, but what started as slightly scratchy throat has me coughing all the time. Developed an itch as well in last week.",4
This BP medication did not lower my blood pressure even after doubleing my dosage up to 40 mg/ day. ,1
impotency,4
"The scratchy feeling in throat . And the tiredness and blurred vision made me stop. Helped with my HBP slightly but side affects were to much,.",3
"I was prescribed because it prevents hardening of my organs overtime.. I'm type 2 diabetic, and take cholesterol medicine=because I am borderline., before a week was up I woke up feeling like someone had their hands on my throat strangling me. no other symptoms. When I read the side effects. I quickly stopped taking it.",1
med working fine but concerned that it could cause damage to kidneys and or liver is there any truth to this guess every hypertension drug would ultimately do the same thing.,5
"It worked great for reducing my high  blood pressure, which was squarely in the high range before I started started taking it.  Unfortunately, after a month, I developed a scratchiness in the back of my throat a couple of times a day.  Over the past 2 months, that has gotten more frequent to the point where the coughing from it is disrupting my sleep. I finally gave up and asked my doctor to switch me to something else.",5
"VERY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL! I have had high blood pressure for years now. On Propanolol my blood pressure was never below 134, and usually ranged between 140-156. Since starting lisinopril about 4mths ago my blood pressure has been consistently normal. It hadn't been normal for the last 10 years (since i started much needed anti-depresents).",5
Started taking this medication and I was prescribed 10 milligrams 1 per day. I got called in for a random urine screen and failed due to a false positive for amphetamines. I did some research and come to find out this medication will calls that if you have any stomach issues such as GERD ulcers for indigestion. The end result with me losing my job. Has anyone else had a problem like this?,1
"After being on Lisinopril for 2 months I developed an inability to clear my throat practically all day long, this has now turned into a very dry cough. I have stopped taking it and I am asking my doctor to prescribe something else.",3
Started taking lisinopril pills eight weeks ago. At the time I had a cold so I did not notice it for a while but it occurred to me that my cough was getting worse rather than better. Concerned about the cough I went to emergency care and received an antibiotic but the cough persisted. I returned to my doctor who advised me to stop taking the medication as my nights had become sleepless and phlegm and saliva were filling my throat along with sinus dryness and leg/knee pain. I am hopeful that my side effects will soon cease.,2
my BP is 180/100. optum says this is my only option. it is not working. i am taking 4 pills/ day and i remain in heart attack range. ,1
"I also have been on this prescribed medication for several years, since being diagnosed with HBP, the doctors kept upping the dose, starting out with 10 mg, to 20mg, and now on 40mg of 1 pill/day.  I was taking this with Omeprozole, for acid reflux, which has no negative interaction w/other meds.  So, earlier in the first years, it was working fine, hadn't noticed side effects until now. Since the last 2 years, been having leg problems, and I, too, have been coughing with it (after reading the other comments from people on this thread).  I've also been prescribed with taking furosemide (water pill) which has a negative interaction with Lisinopril, according to WebMD, interactions with this med may increase HBP levels, and decrease kidney function.  Every blood test I've had (with the VA health care, since I'm a veteran), shown that my kidney functions decreased; and on Dec. 2011, I had one kidney removed for having carcinoma (cancer). By seeing the interaction Lisinpril has with other prescription medications, and after hearing from a friend what this medication does to patients on it, I stopped taking it last week.  Also, I'm on sodium bicarbonate which also has a negative interaction with Lisinopril. I recommend to people to check this drug with your doctor and/or pharmacist for other interactions with medications.  Alone, I guess this drug does its job, but with other medications, its taking a risk of failure or adverse reactions interacting with other medications. ",4
"I have been taking this medication for over 15 years when first prescribed my Dr said it had the side effects of a glass of water, and I do believe it does and it works.  Great Med. ",5
"My systolic has gotten much better, but I continue to have a significantly high diastolic reading.  The worst part, though, is the never ending cough.  I'm now known at work as ""the lady in the corner that never stops coughing"".  How embarrassing.  The coughing also prevents me from getting any decent sleep.",3
"I started having a bad cough and leg cramps after taking this drug.  I knew a cough was a side-effect, so I stopped taking it after about 2 weeks.",2
"This was one of 3 meds I was on for HBP, I took it for years. I had no problems until this past year. It just about killed me. I started with what I thought was falling for some time these spells lasted a few seconds, I would fall and just get up. Then one night I fell woke up later and knew I had lost time. This was the first time I ended up in the emergency room. The next time I passed out getting a haircut. After this every time I went out I was out longer. The last time I was out more than 3 hours and had a 3rd degree burn to show for it. I fell on my computer and was there so long it burned my leg. After many hospital stays and a lot of testing I was taken off this med and have had no other passing out. I was put back on the med and started back passing out again even on a very small dose. Please be cautious with this med. Even if you think something is odd call your Dr and get off it. It is dangerous. We all know a viper bite can kill us and this stuff is made from snake venom.",1
"I was taking this and 2 other meds for HBP. Still wouldn't go down and stay. Took it every day for almost a year and one day my tongue and throat swelled up and almost didn't make it to ER. Almost died before they got the Ventilator down my throat (too swollen) to breath. ER Doc said I was about the 20th patient THIS YEAR (April) he's treated for same thing. If your tongue starts to feel thick, go to ER right then. This happened 30 mins to an hour after taking.",3
"I am 39 male. I started 20mg per day lisinopril about 30 years old. overall , it works. However, it cause coughing, headache(once per spring, once per winter) for me.",4
"Been on this for years. My BP is 120/80 at home but 164/90 whenever someone else takes it, like the Dr. started out at 10mg and eventually up to 40mg. I finally weaned myself off and are currently arguing with my Dr about white coat anxiety.",1
While this may be a good medication for high blood pressure this is not for everyone I started taking lisinopril and developed a very bad cough and it was determined that it was the drug so be cautious if you develop a cough that you can't get rid of please check your medications.,1
"My blood pressure was high at my last physical yesterday: 180 over 110. Doctor prescribed Lisinopril 10mg. Took 1 yesterday afternoon at 2PM. This morning, my BP was 130 over 84! Only side effect was drowsiness, but I'll start taking the medication in the evening from now on.  Makes me more relaxed, and less stressed out when work and home issues arise.  I will continue to use.",5
One 10mg tablet every morning has been an easy regiment to follow.  Keeps my pb around 120/80 consistently.  ,5
I really like this medication,4
I get a little dizzy once in a while Other than that I don't notice any side effects after three years of use. BP is now normal. Was 160. After my heart attack. I'm just glad to sell be alive.,5
This has kept my BP nicely in control for many years.  the only side effect is that I can get a faint feeling if I stand up too fast but never to the point of fainting.  My Dr. says that is common for these drugs.,5
I had high blood pressure for the first time in my life. I started taking the medication and immediately had coughing and problems breathing. I stopped and felt better immediately. My doctor put me on a weight loss program and the bp returned to normal within a week.  ,2
"My BP dropped significantly the very first day of taking this and has remained lower. However, when prescribing it for me, my doctor told me that dry cough is a fairly common side effect. I've now been taking it for three weeks and the 'dry cough' has become so intense and debilitating that I just decided I have to stop. If it was just an annoyance cough I could deal with it, except this is anything but. It comes on with little to no warning and has me hacking to the point of choking.  As such, my throat is sore and my dog looks at me like I'm about to cash out.  No more for me, thanks.",5
My blood pressure is down,3
"Started on 20mg with bp at 165/110. Within 5 hours it was down to 118/73. I've only been on it for a week, but my headaches are gone and the constant fatigue is gone.  I think some people's issue is their dosage may not be high enough. ",5
"I started lisinopril in November. Early December started a cough that would hurt so badly my ribs hurt. It got to the point that I would cough 4 or 5 times in a row, then gag and not cough for an hour. Then the cycle would repeat. Went to my immunologist because thought it was my asthma and allergies. Prescribed steroids and it subsided for 2 days. Once I quit taking the steroids, it can back worse. I cannot sleep, eat and feel miserable all the time. I was reading what could cause chronic cough and came across and article about ACE inhibitors causing chronic cough. LIGHTBULB. Cardiologist verified it was the meds. Wish I would have known this 3 months ago. ",3
"had side effect , violent coughing constantly for over a month.  first dose did not lower my blood pressure hadto increase dosage. ",2
"Took this for about 6 months. Initially started with 10 mg per day.  Developed headache and dry cough. Split pill in half thinking half the dose in the morning and half at night would be easier on my system. Headache and dry cough went away.  Lowered blood pressure. Then 6 months later I developed headache, dizziness and nausea to the point I could not drive. Had these symptoms for a month while doctors tried EKG, MRI and a couple of sessions of physical therapy for vertigo. My wife and I questioned if it could be the Lisinopril and the doctor did not feel that was the cause since I was taking it for 6 months already. Quit taking the Lisinopril and headaches were gone in 1 day. The nausea and dizziness come and go but no where to the extreme it was before.",1
"Facial rash, itchy dark patches on my cheeks.  ",3
Ive been taking it for 1 years 10 mg to start then Dr. upped it to 20 it made my bp go up really high. Went back to 10 mg and was fine for a year then I had muscle weakness. I had all to do to get up and move around. It really dint do much to lower my bp I just stopped taking it after a few weeks feel much better can move around now no weakness. ,1
"I was given lisinopril for my blood pressure. After about a year I stopped this medication. It made my ringing of the ears really bad. I was also taking flomax for bph at the time, which i also stopped. I was put on metoprolol. This last made me put on weight for no reason. My toes on tight food started to hurt, I would have trouble breathing  every time I would go for my walks at the park. It was like an allergythat I developed.  I stopped taking metoprolol. I am trying doxazosin to replace both the BP medication and the BPH (enlarged prostate) medication.  Wish me luck :-).",2
"After taking this drug for nearly 2 years, I suffered a severe angioedema and nearly died.  Ended up in ICU for 3 nights on a ventilator and 5 days total in hospital.  My lips swelled so much that I thought they were going to split open and my throat almost closed completely.  If I had not taken 5-6 Benadryl tablets before going to the ER, I most likely would not have made it.  When I found out how common this reaction is, I am wondering why there is not more emphasis on warning patients about this possibility.",3
"Thank you to those of you referencing the side effect of a cough; you just saved me time and money. After two visits to the doctor and three prescriptions to cure my ""allergies"" producing the cough, which did not help at all, I connected the dots within 5 mins of reading other reviews. You would think the doctor that prescribed this 2 months ago would have looked at this possibility?? Thank you! ",2
"Horrible cough, numbness in my left arm and hand which moved to my face and had stroke like symptoms. made Dr switch to another drug, not worth side effects.",3
Ive been taking it for 3.5 years 20 mg to start then Dr. upped it to 40. Worked well but I now have 45% function of my kineys and went to see a Nephrologist and he said to stop taking it because its killing my kidneys,4
"This is the worst med I've ever taken .I was prescribed 10 mg to Stat and up it to 20 mg in two weeks .I have not stopped coughing and it is so bad I hold a conversation . I also am so tierd all the time I have to pry myself out of bed .I have vomited ,headaches, diarrhea, Its horable I will not refill my script . I need a new med .this one sucks ",1
I had an allergic reaction from the manufacturer lispin and almost died.  Emergency room treatment.  Told some African American women have been having an allegic reaction to medication.  My tongue was swollen and almost blocked my air passages.,1
"I was started on 10mg of lisinopril in August.  I began having a dry cough almost immediately. I knew from the beginning it was a potential side effect. I kept thinking it would go away, but it never did.  I coughed during the day and at night.  My dr switched my medication in December, and the cough began getting better in a couple of days.  No other side effects were noticed. My blood pressure did drop from 150/100 to 130/95 (at dr office) but my blood pressure is usually fine at home.  I expected better results.  ",3
Extreme dry coughing ,5
"I thought the chronic cough would go away after some use but I still have it and I suffer from sinuses ,allergies and asthma ",3
"I have to say I am satisfied with this because my BP was 164/95 and yesterday, it was 126/84!  The doctor was very pleased also.  I did have a cough at first, but really do not notice it now.  I started at 10, but after a month, the BP was still high and my doctor upped it to 20 which seems to do the trick.  Hopefully, I can keep the BP down and continue to have no bad side effects.",5
"I was 24 when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. 144/103 were my readings. After 2 weeks it was 108/80. Pretty effective. Being lightheaded suck and I can't do a lot of heavy lifting with almost passing out. When I eat, my whole chin becomes numb. I think drinking more helps that. Still get chest pain, but not as much. Drs say that's just stress. I hate taking this crap, but the cause is genetic so I have to.",5
The chronic dry cough was horrible.  Switched to another medication.,5
I was warned of side effects such as a dry cough or light headedness if standing up too fast. Been on this for 2 months now with no sides to speak of.  BP dropped from 165/110 to 114/65.  So far so good. ,5
"After being on 50mg of atenolol for 20 years,my bp went up to 180/100. I added 20mg of lisinopril. While it brought my bp down, I developed a rash,gas, and burning skin. I fell and cracked my head. Doctor switched me to valsartan. After first dose my throat started to tighten and my bp went up to 190 over 127. I didn't think I would make it.I dropped 10 pounds and now just take the atenolol.  Bad drugs for me, Need I say more?",3
I have a dry cough at least a dozen times every day,5
Have had a dry cough for months. Stopped taking it. Cough disappeared.,4
"this drug needs remove, it makes skin peel,joints hurt,hair full out,cough, feel bad, wight gain,loss of balance, just a dangers drug.",2
Caused tooth pain,3
took this for HBP  after a year face started swelling severely  NEXT bad drug FDA?,3
"Boarder line HBP. Started on 10mg. Controlled my bp right away, but came at a price. I have worked outside in the Florida heat for 30+ yrs and never sweated this bad! Extreme, excessive sweat! Heat intolerance, itchy throat during the night, and a chronic, dry cough. Went to urologist that told me this lisinopril was not right for me.  Changed me to Telmisartan, 20mg.  Suppose to have less side affects. ",4
"After taking drug for over a year just recently half of tongue swelled up along with throat. Went to ER they gave me steroids and Benadryl started to diminish and sent me home. Next day dr gave me new blood pressure med Losartan. Within an hour back to ER. Did same treatment some swelling went down not a lot, today can't swallow tongue hurts and throat. No remedy yet. Had many other side affects from lisiniprol that I recently learned of. Once I saw side possible side affects I can only assume my several discomforts came from this med. on line they call this the ""death drug"". Sure wish I knew this stuff back when I first started taking this drug. The bad clearly out weighs any good in this drug. It needs to be banned. ",4
"I began taking Lisinopril's generic - Ramipril, 5 months ago. Took it at night with dinner. The first 2-3 weeks were great. I felt so much better. Still do. I was given this BP med as a booster to the other 2 BP meds I take. On the other two I would have BP flare ups a lot up into the 140's/90's and on a bad flare up it would go up to high 150's/90's. Would feel terrible. My Dr thought I needed a little help. I didn't want to take a 3rd BP med but boy what a difference! I immediately noticed a difference and my BP stabilized down into the low 120's/80's and sometimes even under 120. Rarely anymore flare ups and if so would only go up into mid 130's/80's. Monthly checkups with my Dr also confirmed this & she was happy. But after 3 weeks I started noticing a dry cough from time to time. It was more of a throat tickle/scratchy throat feeling at the base of my throat that came out of the blue & would cause me to cough & once I started I couldn't stop for several minutes. Cough so hard I almost throw up sometimes. This would come & go. Some days I'm just fine. Told my Dr about it and she said she could switch me to another med in the same family that doesn't cause coughing. Tried to stay on it but now, after 5 months, the coughing fits have worsened and I can cough so hard I pee my pants! Funny but not funny. My son threatens to hide my med and both he & my husband want me to switch. Finally can't take it anymore so I have contacted my Dr and am having her switch me to other med. That one is Losartan so we'll see how I do. If you're coughing - it doesn't get better or go away - so switch your med if you can't tolerate it anymore. No way to live daily. ",5
"This medication controlled my blood pressure but had my bones and joints aching to the point where i had to stop working. After i discovered it was the lisinopril, i stopped taking it. My bones are still a little sore but at least i'm able to get out of bed without being in tremendous pain. Slowly recovering.",2
After my first week I woke up with half of my tongue swollen I was rushed to the ER.I was put on life support for six and a half days. ,1
So far no glaring side effects.  My blood pressure has gone down from the 130/90 range to the 120/80 range. ,4
i have had this cough about 2 months my dr. said it was my reflux but i know when my reflux flairs up so i went to E.R.they took xrays and blood checked everything i was itching under my skin coughing my brains out but no mucus the dr. said it may be the walking umoni are the flu are lisinopril well i took all my meds and still have that bad cough chocking cough. it was lisinopril.,1
"severe reaction, life threatening emergency room type. angio-edema ",5
Was on 2.5 mg for 5 weeks and at doc office BP was 135/90.  Doc prescribed 10 mg or 4 times dose.  Took it and BP dived to 107/69 BUT got aggravating throat cough.  Called doc who changed to another drug.  Meantime I split dose into 2.5 mg and have ben taking it since.  BP is now 115/75 at rest 151/92 when active. BUT - no cough.  So am remaining on this drug with 2.5mg dose as myBP is not sero=ious enough to warrant heavy dose,3
"I had borderline high blood pressure and was prescribed lisinopril. Until I went to an allergy specialist I did not realize that my chronic cough was not due to allergies/asthma.  My reaction to lisinopril was not only the chronic cough, but also choking on food and drink.  Within just a few days after stopping the lisinopri, my coughing/choking stopped completely.",3
"Started on Lisinopril/HTZ combo at 10mg.  Immediately got my BP down from 145/90 to 120/80 within a week.  After about two months, it started to creep back up.  My Dr. upped the amount to 20mg, and that seems to do the trick.  I do get a dry tickle cough from time to time, but very minor.  Overall very effective med for me.  ",4
"Side effects that mimic a terrible case of flu, extreme fatigue, that ""I feel like I'm going to die, will this ever end"" sensation. I have tried to stay on this med and others like it but never make it past 2 weeks. If this one makes you sick, chances are others of its type will too.",1
"Doctor suggested this medication due to Type II diabetes to protect the kidneys.  Also for moderate HP.  My HP initially came down to normal range, but has since gone back to moderate-usually when I visit the doctors.  Do have dry cough from time to time but don't know if it's attributable to med.  ",3
My blood pressure has decreased over time and I feel better.,5
"I did not realize that Lisinopril was responsible for my hair loss immediately. But I now know that it absolutely has made me lose my hair! I am so upset. My hair is falling out in clumps on my pillow. I just thought I was not moisturizing my hair adequately. Until I purchased some products that totally moisturized my hair. When my hair continued to fall out. I then realized it had to be the Lisinopril, the only medication I am taking.",5
"Hae.hate.hate this medication. Even though my doctor told me I would get a dry cough, it turned out to be much worst. The phlegm was horrible and I would cough so much I would get a head-ache.Coughing in front of my students is not good and makes them and myself worry. If you are on this medication and coughing is a problem, ask to be switched to something different",4
The cough I have been getting has to do with the lisinopril oral. Was not aware of it until I read the other comments that were shown on this medication. This has been the only new medication that I have started taking recently. Will stop!!,2
Dr. prescribed 2.5mg per day and my BP dropped too far.  I cut back to 2.5mg every other day and my BP is in the sweet zone.  I take my 1/2 pill before bed and the only symptom I've had is a bit of light headedness the next day. When I ride in a cramped position for about an hour or more I have to do foot pumps before getting out of my vehicle and then I'm fine.,4
"Lisinopril caused the worst cough I've ever experienced in my lifetime--to the point of vomiting. After two weeks of utter misery while taking this drug, I contacted my PCP and she immediately changed me to something else. The cough took about another 1.5 weeks to subside after discontinuing this med. I have friends who have taken it for years without incident, however. If you're prescribed Lisinopril, expect the worst, and if no horrendous side effects happen, then that's a bonus for you! Good luck!",1
I coughed myself into a headache.  I done so much coughing until my hemorroids are falling out my azz.  This medicine causes mucous to come up and I almost choked.  This med is not for me.,1
I coughed and coughed for weeks.  Tried everything to stop it.  Eventually I discovered after reading patient reviews that it was lisinopril.  Change BP medicine.  Cogh stopped within few days. ,2
"Lisinopril made sicker than the proverbial dog. Indigestion, heartburn, gas, nausea, flatulence, and horrible diarrhea. I stopped taking it and all the illnesses are gone. I now use Losartan. No side effects and my blood pressure is much improved.",1
I started taking it on a Monday. Wednesday I woke up with a mild choking feeling in my throat. Went to a small clinic and was told to may happen with this pill. And was advised to wait it out. Next night I woke up with an extremely swollen bottom lip. Rush to the ER and had to stay over night. The dry cough was beginning to show up as well.,5
This medication caused a cough and muscle pain.  After several months it affected my sleep a lot.    I stopped taking the med and within 48 hours felt so much better.  My Dr. has prescribed something else at this point.,4
"Aside from dozing off at work, it's effective.",3
Medication caused a Dry Cough. ,2
I developed a cough after several days of taking but after three weeks was feeling like I had been hit by a Mac truck. I have stopped taking it and after 48 hrs have significantly less pain. My cardiologist has prescribed a different medication.,4
"i was on lisinopril for 3 months when i started having dry hacking coughing spells for about 10 minutes..then i would be fine. i eventually took myself off the med to see if the cough went away and it did after a couple days. after about 2 weeks, i decided to take ONE pill and about 2 days later, the cough started up again. I took myself off lisinopril 10mg completely and had my doc put me on another medication. ",5

"After decades of very low blood pressure, my blood pressure rose to noticeable levels.  I am somewhat overweight, but exercise regularly.  My feet began to swell with frequency, the first time I was like Fred Flinstone and went to ER not knowing what was wrong with me.  This medication dropped my blood pressure to normal levels within weeks.  I developed the dry cough.  It's getting better after several months.",5
"I have been ""on"" this drug for at least ten years with zero side effects or problems.",4
"My husband developed diabetes on this drug. He now has a fasting blood sugar of 177. He has not diabetes in his family and he exercises. In addition, he is not overweight, eats the correct amount of food or less. This drug increased his blood sugar",4
After a month had body aches and a cough felt like I aged 10yrs.Then the next month bloated my sweat pants were tight.I think the kidneys need to be checked.I quit the pills and will call the Dr. tomorrow! If I have the energy too.,4
"While my blood pressure was effectively managed by Lisinopril, I developed a very annoying, often deep dry cough.  The cough was so strong, it often made me feel as though I were about to vomit.  The coughing also made my eyes water.  After 5 months, I sought a different bp medication.",4
"Works well. Cough well away after a few months. Cheap too, on Walmart 4 dollar list.",4
"I am having side effects such as the swollen mouth, lips, cough, headache, reflux and chronic stuffy nose.  My Dr knew the possible side effects and sent me for blood workups for 2 weeks after I started taking Lisinopril.  Making sure that it is not causing Liver damage. I don't take any other medication, my BMI is in range and I weigh 175lbs at 6 ft, overall healthy but feel awful since I started on this medication.  I grew up under the attitude, ""Dr knows best"" but in this case.. no way.  Im stopping it today, especially after reading all these horrible side effects others are experiencing. On the plus side, my pressure is back to normal, due to the medication.",3
"Ive been taking 10mg Lisinopril for 1 month.  Woke up yesterday and my top lip felt weird, took my dose, woke up this morning and my top gums and lip are red and swollen.  I developed a cough and I fall asleep in minutes.  Stopping this ASAP.",3
"I have been on Lisinopril for about 7 years.  It has been very effective in controlling my BP.  I initally suffered from a mild cough for about 8 months, but it eventually resolved itself.  Nothing like what others are describing.  Based on the timing of when I started taking this, I can't help but wonder if it caused or contributed to my erectile dysfunction.   But I have seen nothing anywhere to suggest that this is a potential side effect, so probably not.  ",4
it kept my BP normal but i began having problems in the bedroom. Caused erectile disfunction,2
resulted in Pancreatitus! ,1
"I've been on this medicine for 2 months, severe stomach pain and reflux. Also bronchitis and constant cough.",4
I have been taking this for a year now. It does keep my blood pressure normal but it also makes me extremely tired.  I have tried several different ways to take the dose and nothing makes a difference.  I am on the lowest dose available and now I am trying to cut it in half and take twice a day. ,5
Extreme vertigo when using generic manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals. Blue hexoganal pill. Other generics were fine- orange round- but this blue was VERY bad for me!!!,5
Taking this med along with generic Coreg has kept my BP at absolute perfect levels for the last 18 months.,5
"I was started on this medication while also being treated for bronchitis, so didn't attribute the coughing to the medication until the cough didn't go away when the bronchitis did. The first dosage didn't lower my BP enough, so the doctor doubled the dosage and the coughing became worse. A big problem since my job requires speaking on the phone for my entire work shift. I also had a couple of episodes of severe diarrhea just a few days apart. Have been taken off of this medication and put on a new one. Hope it works better with fewer problems.",1
Very ineffective and I developed stomach acid and terrible cough. Pressure remain high even when dosage increased to to highest dose.  I wonrder why doctors kept me on it even though I complained until I had to visit a specialist to check what was wrong   worse medication I ever took in my life,1

I experienced dizziness to nearly passing out and a minor stroke while taking Lisinopril. Ended up in the hospital for 2 days.,1
"this medication made me pass out 4 different times over the last year.  the last time i passed out i ended up in ER with a broken nose, several stitches in my face & my lip separated from my gums so i had to have it sewed back on!  So I will not recommend this to anyone.  Also a friend of mine who was taking it passed out and broke his arm.  ",3
I have been taking lisinopril for over 10 years and have not had any side effects. ,5
This drug does not work for me. Other brands do.,1
"While the pill works for blood pressure control.  I ended up with side effects that have yet to go away after using it. I developed a persistent cough that on occasion has made it difficult to catch my breath. I can feel the phlem build up and rattle in my upper chest. Occasionally, I cough some of it up. I continue to get migraines. As a whole, I'm not any better off than I was befor taking this medication.    Instead of high blood pressure I have laundry list of side effects that keep me5e from getting a good nights sleep, and a productive day. ",5

My Husband and family members suffered terribly from my tramatic taking of lisinopril. I will never get those days back, I walk with a cane and am in physical therapy to help my muscules work again. People should be very very careful when taking this medicine. Ask you dr for side effects, search the web for side effects.",3
"I have been taking Lisinopril for 1 1/2 years. Sunday I took the medication before I went walking. As soon as I finished (45 min later), I got back in my car and my whole body started itching. My throat and ears  srarted itching and my tongue, lips and face started swelling as well. I rushed to the hospital and they told me I was having an allergic reaction. Angioedema I think they said it was. I couldn't even keep my tongue in my mouth. I was pumped full of steroids and Benadryl kept for 2 days.  Horrible experience and after doing research, I'm finding that it's a lot more common then I thought. People need to be told. ",3
"While my BP wasn't extremely high reluctantly, I started taking Lisnopril. I did not read about side effects until one week in. Wanted to make sure I was able to pinpoint changes. I have been a bit anxious, irritable, tired & I started taking the pill at night since taking in the day time was making me drowsy. I worked everything out with the exception of this annoying cough that comes out of no where & sounds like I should be treated for cough rather than HBP. I have a great PCP & without hesitation (although he was happy that the meds worked) he has prescribed me something else.",3
I was prescribed this med after diagnosis of type II diabetes.  I also had BP problems and had been taking atenolol for years.  After 8 months on lisinpril I woke up with a slightly swollen tongue.  3 months later I woke up with a really swollen tongue and needed EMS to ER and spent time in ICU. I feel this is a dangerous drug.,1
After being on lisinopril for only 3 weeks I have developed such a horrible cough that my job at a school is now in jeopardy. I cough night and day so bad that my chest hurts and I'm tired from lack of sleep. It got to the point that I stopped taking this med and called my Doctor. He told me to continue taking it and prescribed  a small bottle of cough syrup. I am ready to find a new Doctor that realizes people should not spend their lives continually coughing.  I found a lot of articles from reputable sites saying that older woman should not be using this. They should be put on something other then an ace inhibitor. Now I know why.  ,1
"This is a very dangerous medication!!!I have been taking this medicine prescribed at the Hoag Center of Aliso Viejo, ca. I have developed severe cough attacks during the night and began weezing heavily with difficulty breezing.",1

I've been on Alpha/Beta blockers & now ACE inhibitors. I'd like to know why would my PC prescribe this med for me knowing full well that it Is NOT the best choice of ACE inhibitor for black ppl? At least four times she said ""It's cheap, very inexpensive, it will work for you"" Hello, don't prescribe a med THAT IS CHEAP but detrimental to my health?!!!! Really? Do you think I'd want to take it at the expense of my own health because it is inexpensive??? Please be your own advocate, speak up and if you are African-American DON'T let Dr's prescribe this drug. God Bless you all. ",1
"My blood pressure skyrocketed to way high.  Dr. put me on Lisinopril 10 mg. and told to take it with the rest of my morning meds and I would get migraines constantly afterwards.  I then took it 2 hours AFTER my morning meds and that stopped the migraines.  I drink tons of water (which seems to help with cough), AND changed my eating to cut out as much sodium, fat, sugar, etc., and added lots of fruits, veggies, grains & nuts.  At next blood pressure check, blood pressure dropped to notch just above normal and lost weight. Doctor is pleased.    ",5

"It has worked very well for me.I have been taking it for almost four years now and the only trouble I have had is that when I get over heated,I get to feeling very light headed and must cool down quickly.The prescription stated that I should avoid getting over heated,so I suppose its normal.Several people I know take the exact same thing and have no trouble with the heat while taking it.I imagine it depends on the individual.I have always worked outdoors and very hard and the heat never effected me until taking this medication.I currently take 10 milligrams per day.Otherwise it has done a great job of keeping my bp in check.",5
"I was on Lisinopril for 4 years.  At first I had a mild cough, then in the last year I started having a gagging cough that sometimes made me throw up.  I was coughing so hard that I would wet myself.  Doctor keep treating me for sinus infections.  Went to a new doc and he took me of the drug.  Cough and gagging stopped in two days!

Took this drug for two years with no problems then one night I woke up at 5 am and couldn't breath or talk because my tongue was swollen so bad.  Went to the ER and they determined it was this drug and kept me all day for observation. Went back to Lasix since I also needed a water pill and this helps both problems.,5
"I have been taking it for 3 weeks now; and the only thing I seem to suffer from is a dull ache in my lower back area. I'm assuming this is in the kidney area. My BP readings have fallen to normal levels and below; and my MD is happy with the data I've collected thus far. I get an occasional cough during the day; but nothing like other people are describing, thankfully. I sometimes feel a little light headed; but this doesn't affect my daily routine (driving etc.) I'm on the 10mg dosage once a day, along with a diuretic water tablet once a day also. Hope this review helps someone with this drug for high BP. I was in the ""pre-hypertension"" level. ",5

"Increasing malaise and labored breathing caused me to stop taking this medication after two years.  It was very effective in lowering my blood pressure to 122/76 average, however, the side effects made it impossible to continue taking the drug.",5
dizziness and headaches ,3
Seems to work very well.,5
just started medicine,1
I started 3 days ago -I took it before bed thinking if I had a bad side effect (like nausea or something) it wouldnt be as bad.  The next day I would walk down the hall and my legs felt like I had just hiked 2 miles uphill and by 3pm I was dead tired.  I didnt take it that night and felt fine the next day.  Took it again last night and I am having the same fatigue problem and I can feel a cough developing.  I am stopping and will call my doctor for a different kind.  This sucks.  ,3
"I didn't want to take medication, but was going on a high adventure trip with scouts and recently diagnosed with high blood pressure. Dr. wouldn't clear me unless i took medication.

I also seem to have developed a slight sense of imbalance...which I believe is associated.",4
"I'm a 55 year old male with diabetes which is under control with diet, exercise and low dosage of Metform. The side effects that I had on Lisinopril, only a small daily dose were:  Severe hands and feet itching, leg fatigue, and severe leg pain at night.  These side effects became more common as time went on.  I thought these side effects were the result of my diabetes (Under control) Doctor gave me no clue it was this drug.  I went to another doctor to complain about my nightly  leg pains, and he increased my dose 4x. The first day I increased the dose, my leg pain lasted into the day, and the hand/feet itching increased. So I stopped taking this drug , over several days (Decreasing dosage) myself. I researched this drug online and found thousands of people with the same issue.  I took this drug for about a year with these symptoms increasing over this time. I would complain to my doctor and explain in detail my experiences: and get responses like take Aleve, and anti-itch creams.  The day I was off Lisinopril my hands and feet never itched again, and my nightly leg pain stopped at once. Over several weeks the strength of my legs are getting stronger (90%).  You need to be your own advocate and explore other options.    ",1

"Had issues with previous ACE drugs (chronic cough) but did not notice that with the lisinopril.  After 2-3 years on the drug, I ended up in the ER with a severe allergic reaction.  Also, over the past year or so, I have had intermittent chronic coughing, lately to the point of vomiting.  But since I had been on the drug for so long, I did not connect the two.

"My mom is 80 years old, she was placed on lisinopril oral by her  primary care doctor. I noticed she seemed confused a bit after a week. We took her to her favorite place (the casino) and she started acting like a zombie. Took her next day to her heart doctor. He took her off Lisinopril. A couple days later she was fine. Went back to PC and week later, she was falling down a lot, and back to zomieland. Got so bad we called 911 and off we went to hospital for a week. She hit nurses, pulled i.v's out, saw illusions like soldiers getting in a bus outside her room etc. She also thought it was 1973, then told doc it was the year 1813. etc, lots of weird stuff. A few days later I called and her male nurse said she was much better, she can go home. Took us an hour to get there and she was whacked out again. I talked to nurse and he said he didn't understand it, she was fine when we called. I asked him if they had given her Lisinopril, he said yes this morning.

"I developed a severe, persistent cough with multiple other side effects",3
My dad took this medicine for 2 weeks before he died.  He only took it because he had high blood pressure. But my dad was very active and  ate healthy. He was in great physical condition.  While taking this medicine he noticed swelling on his neck and arms but thought it was poison ivy and went to see his doctor. His doctor prescribed him cordizone to treat the rashes and a steroid.   Two weeks later he died of a heart failure.  Autopsy said he had 70% blockage and his heart was swollen twice as large.  He was only 59 years old.  His father and two older brothers are still alive.  I believe it was this stupid medicine.,1
"I do experience some memory loss such as going from my chair to the computer to look up something and not remembering why I went there. I experienced these same symtoms for a short time, 2 weeks, when I quit smoking 17 years ago. These are the only thing I take and have been for a year.

fine,5
"Don't know if it's Lisinopril alone, or in combination with the other prescriptions I take, but, I do feel tired all day long. On the plus side, It controls my pressure in the normal range all day (24) hours)long! I did learn here on web md, that Aleve and this should not be taken together!",5
"I had 145-155/120-90-respectfully and taking this lisinopril 20mg /day now for many years and I bet that I have saved ten to twenty years off my life it seems, anyway and if I don't take the drug in a about four days or so then I can really start to feel the effects of not taking them.",5
"It has worked well for me with no discernible side effects, however both my husband and MIL had to go off it because of severe dry coughing. I guess everyone responds uniquely, but given its cost effectiveness it's worth a try.",5
Feeling of fatique.,4
"Amazing.  One little pink pill and my bp dropped from 160+ into the 120's.  I have no side effects at all, unlike some of the other reviewers.",5
"This was ""sold to me"" by my heart doctor a a BEST medication with min of side effect. In reality I started feeling absolutely like somnambula and week after one week. Unfortunatelly, it took me 3 month until I desided to read side effect of this and dicover it as ""common"" side effect. Don't take this one unless you desperate",1

"This has been a miracle for me.  My migraines were awful and I got 2 per week. I started 5 mg lisinopril  7  months ago and my headache are almost nonexistent ! When I do get a rare mild one it's gone with a Tylenol. I also take magnesium, riboflavin and butterbur all proven to help migraines.",5
"If you have asthma, or COPD this medication will cause you serious breathing problems.",4
"Since I have asthma and was coughing when I started Lisinopril, I didn't associate the severe hacking cough with the new medication.  I continued using my asthma meds but the cough persisted and, in fact, worsened to the point that I experienced urinary incontinence and vomiting when I coughed.  After four weeks on Lisinpril, I also experienced dizziness, lethargy, palpitations, feeling ""out of it"" and generally unwell.    Thinking that I might have pneumonia, I scheduled an urgent appointment with my allergy/asthma specialist who told me that my asthma was under control and that Lisinopril was most likely the cause of the violent cough.  She prescribed Tessalon Perles to control the coughing spasms but advised me to switch to a different med for hypertension.  I've been off Lisinopril for two weeks and still have serious coughing attacks, but the other side effects have dissipated.  I was disappointed to learn that the cough could linger for weeks or even months after stopping Lisinopril.  I hope that's not the case as it has worn me out.  This was not a good medication for me.",1

I have been taking lisinopril for years and my blood pressure has been excellent even though I take a low dose. I have experienced no side effects.,5
The drug seems OK but the packaging by International Labs is among the worst I have experienced. It is almost impossible to open. Child-proof?? I'll say! It's everybody-proof. My 30 year old son couldn't do it. No wonder International Labs do not have an email address to complain. I hope Walmart sees this report but I'll tell them anyway.,3
NONE,3
"works well, but have started to get headaches.",4

I developed a sever cough.  While having a coughing spell after church two women spoke up and said that it sounded like they did when they took Lisinopril!  All three of us had this severe reaction to this medicine.  My pharmacist and nurse practitioner both agreed that the cough is usually what makes them change from this med. to something else.  ,1

Started having unexplainable red rash on back, then another year appeared on head.  Doctors did not know what kind of rash it was.  Then numbness on thumb with dry skin, unknown why.  Then last year started numbing and tinging in the fingers and hands December 2013 it started in the arms and legs.  Went off this med and all the above is starting to clear up.

My husband started on this medication and after two months of use...He started an awful cough and nasal drip that is still persistent after stopping it for one weeks..He is going back to the physician and with hope he did not cause any damage to his lungs..I hope that every person who reads this will be scared enough NOT to use it..Side effects are very scary and certainly unpleasant.,2
I have been coughing a lot since taking this drug.  I am wondering if coughing is one of its side effects.,3

Been taking for 6 weeks and it has lowered bp to 130/80 but just recently having severe lightheaded ness and anxiety for no reason. Read that both are common side effects but neither are ok to live with. Afraid to drive my kids around when feeling dizzy and anxiety when everything is going good sucks! Asking dr to change meds. Wish I knew which brand was most tolerable.,4
After sixty days on drug I was exposed to sun on beach in Florida for 1 hour. Had horrible sunburn to feet and lower legs. Most severe sunburn I had ever seen.  Found out that is common side affect of lisiopril. Also muscle cramps and other effects. Stopped taking drug will have to go to hospital as this looks serious,3
Lisinopril taken concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide has been effective with decreasing my high b/p has caused some mild intermittent dizziness but the benefits have outweighed this occasional mild side effect.,4
"I was put on this medicine after having my first child due to me being pre-eclamptic during my pregnancy. My blood pressure never returned to normal so I was stuck on this medicine. I continued to take this medicine over a course of 4 years. During those years, I was constantly experiencing, severe swelling of my ankles, hands, face, and not to mention, overly excessive urination! I was constantly dizzy and felt faint all the time. I had zero energy and all I wanted to do in my spare time was lie down and sleep. My blood pressure stayed elevated. Well, last year I changed PCP's and my new PCP hurried and took me off of this medicine. She told me that studies show that Lisinopril does not work in African Americans, it works against us! So she took me off of it and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide, and immediately all my symptoms went away, and I felt better immediately! I have a few family members that was on this medicine as well, and was experiencing very similar symptoms to mine. So, I told them to get off of it and their existing symptoms would change immediately! So I do not recommend this medicine for people of African/Black American decent.",1
"I recently started taking lisinopril and the first week i was very nauseous and throwing up, second week severe stomach pain, third week could not stop spitting up mucus, I have been sick from the day i started taking this medication.Females taking this medication should pay very close attention to your breast.

"I started out on 10mg dose,but pressure kept rising,so my ddoctor increased the dose to 20mg..still not effective,so doctor added a diuretic...BP still running around 160/97 so I will be asking her to try something else. This doesnt seem to be stabilizing it at all.",2
My blood pressure rises every time I received this particular generic manufactured pill.,1
"Lisinopril 10 MG controlled my blood pressure but made me tired, gave me headaches and made me dizzy at times. After several months, I started to get heartburn, had difficulty swallowing and got hiccups when I ate. I switched to another med and in several weeks all symptoms disappeared. I have more energy and am not tired all the time on new med.         ",4
Started taking 20MG of this 6 days ago. already my BP went from 150/115 to 122/91. I have noticed that I lose my breath fairly quickly now doing moderate activity and my heart beats alot faster since starting this drug. My resting heart beat is about 95bpm and when doing any kind of workout it gets above 200bpm. Happy with the lower BP but going to ask the Dr. to take me off of it.,5
it has lowered my moderate high blood pressure but I recently had nose bleeds,5
I get pneumonia several times a year since taking Lisinopril. I had never had pneumonia before.  My recovery is very slow.  I usually stop taking Lisinopril to recover.  I usually have a cough.  I am trying hawthorne and hope to drop Lisinopril.,5

i have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3 since starting on lisinopril,3
"BEWARE!  This drug put me in the ER...twice!!  The first time, I was experiencing severe upper-abdominal pain, which my physician assumed was my gall bladder.  After extensive testing at the hospital, it was decided that I had a 'virus.' (At this point, no connection to the Lisinopril as the cause had been made.)  The second time, three weeks later, I woke up with my throat and uvula so swollen that I could barely speak.  Off to the ER again where things finally started to improve after receiving high doses of depo-medrol (steroids) and benadryl through an IV.  It was then that the doctors concluded I was having severe allergic reactions to the Lisinopril!  I was taken off of it immediately and was back to normal within a week.  TAKE WITH CAUTION!!!  At the very least, you will likely develop the annoying dry/hacking cough, which is bad enough on its own and reason enough to skip this awful drug.",1
I have been getting hemoroids am wondering if this is a side effect but blood pressure has stabilized also get headaches,4
"i was in the ER for bp 223/127 and was given this drug to take home, I was back in the ER 5 days later as this drug reaked havoc on my system, my lips were on fire, I felt horrible and my BP was back to 212/116, am on other drugs now that work for me, scary",1

Within a week of starting this medication I noticed I was feeling very fatigued, having muscle cramps, and feeling lightheaded at times.  Today I could barely get up 2 sets of stairs!  I work out regularly and last night got dizzy in class and had no energy.  Maybe reducing the dosage would help - I am going to contact my doctor.  No issues with cough or nausea so far like others have mentioned, but I have definitely noticed some side effects.",3
"I took my first pill yesterday and I don't like the side effects already. I was so dizzy and light headed it scared me. Very lethargic.  I also had bad upset stomach, Dr. said try and recheck BP in 10 days. I am gonna take at night. I will continue to take and see what happens...",3

I'm a swimmer and after a couple of weeks on med I started noticing I couldn't hold my breath for any length of time while swimming laps. I would come up gasping for air. Then I started noticing that I was wheezing nightly about 45mins after taking. I always checked my bp while on med and it didn't lower enough to constitute continuing with the above side effects. Even went down to 10mg at bedtime, still same outcome. I also noticed shortly after I starting it, I would doze off shortly after eating. I have never been able to nap or sleep during the day unless I'm extremely sick or in pain. I noticed that there were a few other reviews with same issue of napping after eating. ",2

For someone who has always had long & thick hair, this is not exactly the side effect that I want to experience. In the list of side effects, it lists hair loss as a rare side effect. Just remember if you feel like you're losing a lot of hair, it's probably the drug, talk to your doctor. ",4

I think I'll quit the med and continue weight loss efforts to get rid of Diabetes.",1

it works great no problems with my blood pressure since taking this medication,5
I speak for a living.  I coughed 24x7 - and sounded like I was a 30 year 3 day a pack smoker.  This might have been tolerable but when I would lay down to sleep - the coughing was so bad I would end up vomiting.  My stomach went into convulsions.  I continued to experience day time coughting even three weeks after discontinuing the use of this medication.  The pill is easy to swallow and is very inexpensive,2
"I have experienced migraines for 14 years and have tried other prophylactics (nadolol, propranolol and amitriptyline)but lisinopril is the only medication to work.  It has reduced my migraines from 4 episodes a month to 2. I am thrilled with these results.",4
diahhrea,3
"I have been this drug since August 2013. I have the worst dry and persistent cough, my skin is itchy and my feet are very dry. I was on Amlodipene before with Atenonolol, but when I was diagnosed with Diabetes, my doctor took me off the Amlodiopene and added the Lisonpril. I asked her about the coughing and she said I had to stick it out on the med since it was better to have my blood pressure controlled then to have the coughing stop. I'm going back to her because I need to stop coughinge and wetting my pants.",3
"Experienced severe dizziness on another BP med, had to go the ER. My doctor said it was the Metoprolol so he switched my med to Lisinopril.  I've only been on Lisinopril for about a month and so far I've experienced nausa, lightheadness, rapid heart beat",3
"moderately high b/p. After 6 weeks, I was extremely fatigued and my b/p had dropped way too low---90/50 was not uncommon. My MD told me to stop---the GOOD part thought is that it sort of re-booted my system. 6 months later, and I am regularly 117-123/60-63. Not fatigued either. Don't understand it, but happy with it.

I've been taking this medicine a little over a year now and I've noticed a difference in my hair and my skin. My skin is EXTREMELY dry on my feet and hands. Also my hair has thinned and my texture changed. I often have odd pain in my arms when moving. It takes a lot of energy from me too. I'm really not a medicine user so it has to be this drug because I've never had these issues in the past  I'm taking 10mg for my bp caused by pkd but the long term effects of this drug are really starting to show.While it's lowered my bp a little I'm struggling with the issues its causing.,3
I am glad my doctor has put me on this medication. My blood pressure runs ungodly high and so far I can honestly tell a difference. I truly know when my blood pressure is out of sorts and that is a scary feeling for me. I'm really not that old yet but sure not getting any younger and my medical condition has taken its toll on me in the last few years. Day by Day !! It's working for me so far   GOOD LUCK !!,5

I've been on Prinivil since 2010 for Medullary Sponge Kidney with Nephrocalcinosis age 34 and have had great results. I developed a dry cough that is sometimes annoying BUT I'd rather cough and be healthy then not taking something that's working with my creatine and calcium levels. ,5
severe allergic reaction,5
Dr. prescribed Lisinopril to protect my liver and kidneys from diabetes. Developed sore and swelled throat and voice was very rough and ragged. Stopped taking medication after 3 weeks. At times my voice continues to be rough and ragged.,3
Nasty cough...Quit taking (with Dr. o.k.)and 5 days later still coughing and sinus draining..Affecting sleep HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST? ANYONE KNOW?,2
on Lisinopril for about 3 years. Also on diltiazem and hydralazine. Tried to go off Lisinopril on my own. After 7 days BP began to increase.  Resumed taking Lisinopril. First day BP bottomed out 97/67.  Second day BP ok 120/50. I think reaction was due to Ambien I took the night before. Never had a problem with cough.,5
"I've been on this drug for over 15 years, but am now having rapid heartbeat, heart fluttering, dizziness and cough, sweating and nausea. Has anyone else suffered from the fluttering? I know I've read about the rapid heart beat, but has anyone felt the fluttering and has anyone experienced an awful pain in your ribcage area?",5
Caused a cough that only disappeared when I had been off the medication for around 3 months.,3

"I had been having headaches feeling light headed my speach had slowed down.My friend told me I needed to get my blood pressure checked (we work in an internal medicine office) So I did and it turn out my b/p was very high, And that is why I was put on lisinopril.",5
"Took 1 pill (10 mg) at night, the next morning I ended up in the ER....BP plummeted, sugar was high, nauseous, dizzy, cramping and diarrhea - I almost died. Drs said I was allergic to ace-inhibitors. My husband has been taking 30mg for a while, but I noticed that I get dizzy and sick feeling after we are intimate. Has anyone encountered a problem like this??? Please help!!!",1
"This medication caused me to have SEVERE fatigue and muscle pain.  Also, caused a dry cough.  Symptoms went away when I stopped the drug.  My doctor didn't believe it was the medicine causing my symptoms. So after 3 months of being in bed most of the day, I stopped on my own (against his advice) and was back to normal within a few days.  I then controlled my pre-hypertension with diet (low salt and lots of fruits/veggies).  It's been 4 years and I check my BP regularly and it stays within normal limits with diet and exercise.  ",4
Works with no noticeable symptoms.,5
"This is a horrible med. Had persistent face swelling over time. Got so bad that my face swelled up until my bottom lip burst open so I had to go to the Emergency room. Also...it messed with my emotions, sadness, strange thoughts, and hateful feelings. Had persistent diarrhea also ..stay away from this stuff!!!!",1
"i am very concerned about the side effects....they are interfering with my life style.....my puppy and i walk approximately 20 miles a week.....my thigh muscles are soooooo tired!!! i must push myself to continue, which i am attempting to do....also the cough is getting worse and worse, especially towards evening and bedtime, which makes me very nervous when going to sleep....my sugar is raised and i have trouble waking up, which has never been a problem before!,,,,felling tired after 7 or 8 hours of sleep are not a good sign to me...i am very active....thankyou...fi",3
I've been on Lisinipril for almost 20 yrs and have recently figured out that the burning pain in my feet may be related to this medication.....will try and get switched to something else in the near future.,4
"I went from hypertensive crisis, 188/108, to 127/82 in 48 hrs. Now let's see how it works long term. No side effects after two days!",5
"Shortly after I began taking I started to experience awful coughing episodes with some shortness of breath.  At first I thought they were allergy related, but then figured out maybe it was the drug.  Called my doctor and they said to stop taking it.  It's been 2 weeks since I quit.  No more shortness of breath, but still having occasional coughing spells.  Hopefully they will go away soon.  Very irritating.",2
"The coughing spells are outrageous for me, causing me to get dizzy and incontinent at the same time. I have to keep cough medication with me at all times; try a bottle every two weeks!  Going to switch to something else.",3
I am not one to take medication but I couldn't lower my BP with exercise and diet. High BP runs in my family.  I finally listened to my doctor.  BP used to be 150/90 but now is normal 120/70.  No side effects.,5

"I feel a little dizzy, some joint pain, more coughing then usuall, very low energy,and not sleeping well.",3
good results by maintaining a healthy blood pressure,5
I've used this drug for 5 years beginning with 5 mg and increasing to 30 mg/day. Haven't experienced the hacking cough and don't even know I'm taking it. Much better results than HCTZ or Inderal. I suppose if I need to take one of the bp drugs at least this is an older one with proven results. I'm not sure I'm happy this drug is manufactured in a 3rd world country.,4
"After taking this medication for less than a week, I developed a dry pesky cough that included a very scratchy throat.  Doctor switched my medication today, so hopefully will be a better match for me",4
"I have been taking this medication for about 5 years. Every since the first day I received this medication, I have had severe coughing. I wish there was another medication suitable for me. ",2

I have a horrible cough.....but my BP is good! *cough* *gag* ,4
I took a low dose-my B/P was occasionally elevated. I did not notice much difference in my BP but after I stopped the drug my cough disappeared & the ringing in my ears improved so these must have been side effects of the drug,1
"I had a serious reaction put me in ICU for 2 days. My dog woke me up he realized I was not breathing right I woke up to vomiting, diarrhea, clammy, sweating, dizzy an gasping for air, I am a CNA so I could tell my oxygen level had dropped and I thought I was having a heart attack called 911 went to E R and was put in ICU. I was so scared I was diagnosed with Hypoxic respiratory failure, lactic acidosis. I am lucky to be alive an I am thankful to my dog or I would not be here to tell this story. My Dr. Has changed my medicine with no ACE- INHIBITORS.",4
"Horrible hacking cough, tickle in throat & mucous in esophagus/lungs.  Major cramping, diarrhea, back pain.  Minimally lowered blood pressure.  I stopped taking this garbage & some symptoms disappeared immediately.  The cough/congestion hung on for weeks, it has finally cleared up.  Pay cheaply, get exactly what you pay for.......TROUBLE! ",1
"I took 20 mg of Lisinopril each day for less than a month along with my usual Lopressor. It helped to lower my BP somewhat, but at what a cost!  I had a chronic ""hair ball"" in my throat that no amount of coughing, drinking, cough meds or cough drops could help.  It would interfere with my sleep and with my speech while awake.  Nasty stuff!  I quit taking it, and the hair ball disappeared. ",3
"I was a little hesitant on taking this drug because of the reaction to the drug that my husband had.(Bad cough)I have now been on this for a little over two months and have had very little coughing so far, but I am monitoring this closely. ",4

"took this after heart stent put in 2010 seams too be working ,,",3
Great drug. I've been taking it for years for borderline HBP. Not a single side effect. Works great and is dirt cheap with insurance. ($2.00 per month),5
Coughing is too much. Even after 7 months of ononly 10mg.,5

"Was taking Amlodipine (which caused severe itching, pus like rash on legs, inner arms & chest)& discontinued use. Rash stopped, at the same time I have been on Lisinopril for 6 months & it has been hell for me. Many side effects: nausea/vomiting, severe headaches, lightheaded, dry itchy eyes,dry cough that kept me awake nights,weight gain, shortness of breath & depression. Would not recommend drug usage.

took med for 1 wk also taking Eplerenone. info leaflet states monitoring is needed if taking these two.  Also states Lisinopril may affect your blood sugar.  I ate properly the night before in the morning blood sugar had crashed.  Woke up confused!! Stop taking med because only new med added to other old ones. This has two many side affects.,1
"It did lower my bp, but I got dry cough. Dr. gave me holiday for one week, almost done, still coughing and can't sleep or just do daily activity.",3

"A side effect mentioned in the paperwork I was given with my Rx of Lisinopril mentioned the occurance of scaley dark moles appearing in places on the body.  After two weeks of taking the medication I had started developing these moles on my hands, arms and legs.  I informed my doctor of this and he described it as an allergic reaction and promptly took me off Lisinopril.  It's been two weeks since that time and I have developed more moles with the addition of rapidly growing warts on my hands.",2

It started with a cough and sore throat, then quickly progressed to feeling dizzy and faint with a sensation of spinning, headache, ringing in ears with fluid, fever, some hives, red skin with all over the body itchiness.  Very short of breath with any movement, high pulse rates (98 to 120). high blood pressure; over 140/90, fatigue with feeling shaky, and weakness in legs.

"For six months I suffered with a relentless cough, accompanied by weepy eyes and a waterfall of mucous. I had no idea that it was a side effect of the 10 mg of lisinopril that I took daily.  My doctor took me off this drug following a thyroidectomy last month.  The cough continued, except when I was in the hospital and a few days of convalescence at home. I couldn't figure out why I was cough-free for those few days until I needed to resume taking the prescribed pain reliever. I realized that the Tramadol HCL stopped the cough! I was stunned! This pain reliever is non-narcotic and non-addictive and easy on the stomach.   My doctor ordered a refill so that I could continue taking it for this horrendous cough.  I only need to take one pill in the morning and one at night, and I'm good to go.  On my next visit with him I will ask about the long-term effects of taking this drug as a cough suppressant.  Hopefully, this cough won't preempt my life indefinitely, but in the meantime I give thanks that I had that surgery when I did, and found some relief.  My heart goes out to all of you suffering from this affliction. Discuss options with your physician before  this insidious cough hijacks your life! ",5

My PCP just left for vacation so the ER doctor suggested to half dosage in have to 10mg and see what happens. I did that and in a few days at my daughters I rechecked my pressure and it had dropped even more (88/50) next day (75/55).

I have been getting severe allergy problems and went to see an allergist..I was tested for everything under the sun and came up negative to everything! He diagnosed me with non-allergic rhinitis due to lisinopril which is an ACE inhibotor. My doctor switched me to Diovan HCT and hopefully I will be better.

Bad dreams and insomia. Stopped taking drug and feel much better. But my BP started to go back up. Trying new med losartan. Hopefully it will be better.,1

I also have trouble swallowing. I believe this drug should be taken off the market or wouldn't be suprised if the FDA takes it off the market some time soon. I think the Family Medicine MDs and DOs are in denial on this drug. It works but the side effects seriously outweight the benefits. I have been off it for a month now and the side effects seem to get worse. Data have read says it could take years for the side effects to go away.",5
"Taking this medication for over 5 years, then it stopped working for me.  Developed severe cough, pains in my back and most worrysome was the pain in my right side.

Sometimes even the muscles in my lower arms start cramping up.  This is very painful.  I asked my Doctor about the medication.  I wanted to know if it was causing it.  She said ""No way."",  so I'm still coughing my head off, but I found that taking magnesium 250mg twice a day has improved the cramping a lot.  Not gone, but helped.

Even that is proving to be too much & my BP drops very low (105/53). I have been on it for several years, but my Dr & I need to chat about this as I cannot continue to feel like I am going to pass out when my BP 'bottoms out' like it has been doing!

Modified diet, lost 35 lbs. Walk/jog daily.  No longer taking plavix.  Cholestorel dropped from 240 to 140, other numbers improved considerably.    No adverse side effects noticed from any of these drugs.  I believe that moderate consitent exercise and improved diet can counteract negative effects of these drugs.  Also, positive mental outlook does not hurt. ",4
"I went to my regular doctor for a wellness examine for insurance purposes. My blood pressure was 132/83.  I have never had blood pressure issues before.  My doctor decided that I needed some medication so he put me on the Lisinopril 20mg/ once a day.  I also have ALS which effects my bulbar region (diagnosed in March 2012).  I see a neurologist for this.  I was concerned about the med. but began taking it 2 weeks ago.  First week I felt find, but this second week I am absolutely exhausted and have been having slight migrains.  I believe this exhaustion is due to the blood pressure medication and not the ALS.  After reading what the other people are saying about this drug I have great concerns.  I do not need to be exhausted due to medication because I am trying to live my life as full as possible due to the ALS.",2

My legs hurt very bad while taking this drug. The left leg hurt so bad behind my knee that I could not walk on it. My legs even hurt while I was laying down. After about 2 months I stoped taking the drug and a few days later my legs stoped hurting. My husband took this drug for a couple of years and almost cried his legs hurt so bad. We never knew the drug had this side effects untill after he died. I figured out what was causing my legs to hurt after I started taking this medcine. A friend of mine told me her legs had hurt for year or two and I told her my experience with this medcine she ask the doctor to take her off of it. He did and her legs got 95 percent better. This medcine will cause a big knot behind the knee also. This should be listed on the side effects but it is not. Doctors sometime will not beleive a person when they tell them about this medcine causing the legs to hurt. So far 3-4 people that I know of has proved it. Watch out for this side effect. You will hurt really bad in your legs.,1

"Side effects of this medication were terrible !! . They got worse over time instead of better so I had a hard time telling what was causing my issues.    I felt completely run down all the time, weak, fatigued, no energy at all.  I originally started taking 10mg tabs and the side effects were bad but I thought I could live with them.  Then my BP went back up and I started taking 20mg tabs.  I literally thought I was going to die from the side effects.  Most days I did not even want to get out of bed, let alone got to work.   Within 3 days of stopping I felt better than I have in the past 2 years ",4

I have been experiencing the cough, that hurts and now have mucus. There was pain in my neck and arms.  I have also experienced severe leg twitches/jolts while I am lying down in bed.

"The side effects of this medicine are horrible.  Ive copy this from wikipedia on how the drug is made. An ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) is a pharmaceutical drug used primarily for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure.  Originally synthesized from compounds found in pit viper venom, ACE inhibitors inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (a component of the blood pressure-regulating renin-angiotensin system), thereby decreasing the tension of blood vessels and blood volume, thus lowering blood pressure.  Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril why would i want to take anything made from snake venom, however this explains the side effects.  They need to take this drug off the market.",2

"Lisinopril-HCTZ 10-12.5mg was poison for me! [exhaustion,aches,hair loss, overheating, shortness of breath on exertion,depression, cough, malaise]  I took it for 2 months.

I complained to my Dr.s ( State Health Dept.) nurses all of 7 yrs. now and they just keep saying to stop smoking. Of course I need to stop smoking, what smoker doesn't? Little did I know until today, that it is the Lisinopril making me cough!! The coughing has caused so much damaged to my body. It's a tremendous force and blow to my body every time I cough. Of all the cough complaints on all these forums and such, a warning label must be put on this medication that EVERY dr. cannot miss!! I have even cough until my bladder has came apart inside and broken a rib. I hate this medication and I am stopping it today. As for the dr., I have no health insurance, so I may as well sit at home and die. At least I will not have the cough while dying from a stroke or heart attack.",3

I take 10mg per day, which isn't a large dose at all, and have not experienced any harmful side effects at all.   I also started to exercise (mainly just walking) and am now reducing my dosage to 5mg to see how that works.   Who knows, I may be able to stop taking it completely if I continue to exercise.   I have lost 30 lbs in the last 4 months, and am down to 170 lbs.   My dr says I'm doing great and may be able to completely stop taking the lisinopril due to a little bit of extra effort to get my butt off the couch.",5

"I am a 34 year old male and have been taking this medication for high blood pressure for 4 months. for the past nine days I have experienced severe chest pain, leg pain, back pain, neck pain, arm pain, and hand pain. Essentially my entire body was in severe pain. After a consultation with my doctor and two trips to the ER I was told that is was not Lisinopril. I have also been through, in the last nine days, a chest xray, MRI, and enough bloodwork to keep Dracula happy. I was then told to consult with a neurologist. Lastly I took it upon myself to research this medication and voluntarily stopped it for a few days. I already feel the horrendous pain beginning to subside. The mental anguish that both I and my family endured these past days is indescribable. This medicine has SEVERE side effects. I will say, it DID lower my pressure and got rid of all headaches and migraines, but nearly killed me. I hope this post helps at least one person. ",1

I am still tired and have to take nap after work, also lately i feel faint frequently to the point I almost passout. Not sure but, i think I will see my dr to switch to different meds ",4

"This medication has immediately helped control my hypertension. However I have been trying to determine the source of chronic dry cough and find that my MD thinks it is the Lisinopril. The cough is life changing. No sleep, can't talk or eat without coughing. Not worth the use to me.",5
"I developed a dry cough shortly after taking this drug. I work in a hospital and many of my patients asked me was I ok and were concerned I had something contagious! It lowered my bp impressively.

It didn't help that my doctor didn't realized it was the medicine doing all that.  He prescripbed me an inhaler, allergy medicines, antibiotics, etc.  When I finally when off the med, the cough stopped.  I'm on another bp med that works just fine.",4

"After being on this drug(40 mil)for two years I suddenly had a severe reaction to it in the middle of the night.  Started out feeling like I had razor blades in my throat, followed by severe swelling of my lymth nodes & tongue.  I couldn't swallow and had a great deal of trouble speaking.  I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance where they hooked me up to an IV and monitors for 12 hrs.  Instructed not to take it any longer.",1
This medication certainly lowered my BP and that is where the pros end.  Side effect of nasal drainage but a cough from h-ll!  I have taken this drug for nine (9) months and have coughed more in the last nine months than I have in the past nine years.  And the cough is (was) to the point sometimes I gagged and almost chocked.  Otherwise.. no problems...  Stopped taking the drug last week.  Cough almost gone away.,4

The first time it lasted about 3 days and went away.  This time, I'm on day 2 so hopefully after tomorrow it will go away and I'll feel fine and have normal bp.",4
"Developed the sharp tickle cough but is not constant, however I experience very painful almost neuropathy symptoms within a month of taking, a tightness in chest and heart palpitations.  since my kidney numbers are back to normal, I am going to experiment and see if the leg pain goes away when I am not taking.  I am glad to see that some others are experiencing similar side effects as it might not be extreme pain from neuropathy.",4
"After having SEVERE headaches with Bystolic, I started taking lisinopril, after 2 months on this drug my headaches are few. But the new side effects are lightheadness, weird dreams, feeling like I am in a fog, palpations and rebound elevated bp at times.

"I was prescribed LISINOPRIL-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 10-12.5 MG TABLET and have been taking for approximately four years. One tablet each morning quickly controlled BP. The Lisinopril caused side effect of persistent cough, especially after eating; also caused tickling of throat at night. Drinking water did not help however sucking on hard candy or chewing gum got the saliva glands going to alleviate cough and throat tickle. Lost a lot of sleep these last four years. Hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ (a diuretic) caused dry mouth, which contriubted to cough, and some cramping in the strangest places (jaw, scalp, back). I have been proactively working to get cholesterol within normal range and after doing extensive research, found out that HCTZ can also cause elevation in cholesterol by as much as 12%. Talked with my doctor to get meds changed. Would recommend this med due to its effectivenss with caveat that you monitor side effects closely.",5
"Blood pressure is running average now was high before . No side effects, would recommend",4
"I was prescribed lisinopril about 3 yrs. ago because every time I go to the dr's office my BP spikes(white coat syndrome). She panicked and put me on 20mg a day.

The AFib happens very infrequently so I am unsure how effective this drug is for preventing it, having only been in treatment for about 45 days. I had a problem with elevated heart rate upon awakening from sleep which would at times lead to an ""attack"" of AFib and the drug seems to have alleviated that problem. So far it has not been 100% effective at controlling my high BP. My BP is not extremely high; only a few points above borderline on both the systolic and diastolic. An additional drug is being considered to assist in this effort. I have had no side effects that are detectable, however 45 days may not be enough time for any to develop as yet. ",4

"I have been on this med for nearly a month now. My headaches are back, my stomach aches & burns to the point that I don't want to eat or drink anything, my urination has slowed way, way down to where I feel like I have a kidney infection & my blood pressure keeps going down very low to where I get very dizzy & lighthead. On strange thing is that when I lean my head back I feel like I'm going in circles & really get dizzy, I'm so weak I feel like I'm sick all the time (like with the flu). I can't take this I'm going back to my Triamenterene I felt so much better on it.

"This drug worked great at lowering my pressure but I could not take the cough , I tried everything to sooth the cough but it kept making me lose sleep , this drug is cheap and works if you can stand the coughing . I now switched to Losatan and the coughing stopped but not sure yet if it lowers the pressure as good as this one did . I now pay $80.00 a month vs the $4.00 this drug was . I wish I did not have to change because this drug really worked and other than coughing I had no other problems with it . Seems all these blood pressure meds have nasty side effects , I just hope that I found one now that doesn't , too soon to tell . I did find that when I coughed a lot lifesavers helped but who wants to be woken up all hours of the night and have to eat lifesavers ? ",4

Today is my 1st day so I guess we'll see how it goes but I'm NOT going to put up with having headaches again or my Lupus & RA flaring up more than it does.

It would start with a sharp pain in my throat (like a pin sticking ) then the tears would come--and the COUGH!!  It was truly the cough from H_ll. Couldn't sleep at night for it.  I think I kept Robitussin cough medicine stock up for a couple of months.  Nausea-horrible coughing!! When I read some of the reviews on this site, I stopped taking it immediately!!  I was so excited to know that I wasn't losing my mind or dying, I called my doctor's office that day and went in the next day.  My doctor didn't seem nearly as excited as I was about my discovery.  If you think a med is causing a problem, don't think you are crazy! And don't be intimidated!!  You know your body!! What is so bad that if your symptoms are so horrible, it's really hard to think straight.",1
ON IT FOR 6 WEEKS. TOOK 10 MG THEN SWITCHED TO 20MG.. VERY BAD COUGH. UPPER RESPITORY INFECTION 2 TIMES IN 30 DAYS. SINUS DRAINAGE. TIGHTNESS IN CHEST. DR HAS SWITCHED ME TO LOSARTAN 100 MG..START IT IN THE MORNING,2

Stopped taking this drug when my blood pressure dropped to 78/61... This drug is not for me but urge others to be aware of all of the side effects.",5
I have taken this for over 5 years and yesterday woke up with a distorted face. I looked like a gorilla the swelling in my lips and cheeks was unbelievable. Dr immediately attributed the angioedema to lisinopril. I had taken prednisone and benadryl at home before going to office but he also gave me a shot of steroids. I am now wondering if the fatique and night sweats I have had for years may also have been a side effect. I will go back to HCTZ.,4

"I have been taking this medication for a few months now, not for my BP but for my kidneys. I noticed that I developed this nagging cough and nasal drip that never seems to go away. A friend of mine that had been on it told me that, ""it's a side affect"" I thought she didn't know what she was talking about. But after reading some of the other comments I now realize that she was right. I've also noticed that I keep a headache, as well.

"Chronic cough and scratchy throat, joint pain, stuffy nose",5
When first put on meds for HBP the intitial brand (cant remember name of drug) made me cough. Doctor changed me to Lisinopril and cough dissapeared. I have been taking Lisinopril for about 20yrs and have no side effects at all that I can contribute to its use. Being overweight and old aged and inactive does cause some fluctuation in BP but on a normal regular daily check it does keep my BP in control.,5
developed hives after 6 years of taking Lisinopril,5
"I have been taking this medication for five weeks. I have developed a horrible cough, which is even so hard that I gag! I feel tired because of lack of sleep due to the coughing episodes. My PCP has put me on allergy medications to ""rule out"" allergies as a factor. I know my body; this cough is from Lisinopril! I am so tired of coughing! Why is the drug company not improving this product?",4
"just started, ned more time to examine",2
good at controlling BP,4
"Pros: Lowered blood pressure  Cons: Felt tired all the time, dry eyes, low sex drive, headache....I stopped this drug 4 days ago and switched to a calcium Channel blocker....I feel great now that I'm off this drug and all of the side effects have gone away..I was really starting to think I had cancer or HIV because of all of the side effects.  I really felt that something was wrong with me.   I went out and got so many blood test and everything came back ok.  I asked the doctor to switch me to a CCB and now I feel like my old self again.  I'm 27....I wish I never took lisiponril.  The side effects were to much.  I feel great now,  I feel brand new.  I feel young again.  Most importanly I feel healthly and no longer feel like I'm sick.  I feel great.  I'm glad I did the research about blood pressure medicines.  If it was not for that I would have never asked my Doctor to switch me to a Calicum Channel Blocker.  From what I hear though CCB work better in African American males anyway.  My sex drive is back and the headaches are gone and my eyes don't feel dry anymore and I have so much more energy.  Thank You God!",3
Took lisinopril 40mg. once a day for 20+ years.  HCTZ 12.5 mg. was added to the treatment the last 7 yrs. It controls my BP very well.  I  have an occasional dry cough whichmight be related to product.,5
the cough and post nasal drip have caused me to stop taking this medication. More excersize and watching what i eat has kept my bp in check.,3
I have just started this drug which i hate doing. but i dont want to die from high bp. i am searching for alternate meds which have few or no side affects. i am having surgery 8/1 and i need to take asprin wen i come home for a blood thinner.  with this drug i cant do it. what happens now,2

works for me. makes me tired but varying BP is NOY good either.,5
I alway's feel tried after I take this med. I have chronic back pain and I went to my doctor who then checked by blood pressure which was 171 0ver 100. At that time she decided I needed this medicine. How ever I have been testing my pressure at the pharmacy and it has been running in the range of 130/79 for about a month. I have not even been taking this medication as often as I should and still seem's ok. I did see my doctor about three week's and she didn't indicate to me that I should stop taking the med. I have been bruising alot lately and then they break open and bleed. I am 58 and the web site indicated that with age one may bruise more easly. Can Lisinopril cause bruising?,2
i have taken  this med for years my blood pressure goes up and down like a yo yo doctor now wants me to take 40 mg 2/aday now bphas dropped like a rock it is now getting on the low side,4
"I have developed a dry cough which is persistant, could that be a side effect of Lisinopril?  I have been taking it for over six months.",4

"Developed uncontrollable diarrhea, dry hacking cough, runny nose & constantly itchy eyes. I also suffer with what used to be mild psoriasis. This drug has caused terrible flare-ups with this. I am patiently waiting for my PCP to change this med. It DID lower my blood pressure, the one good thing about lisinopril. ",3
"This drug is awful, developed horrible cough, depression, panic and anxiety attacks. Had no idea this drug was causing this. Why is this stuff allowed on the market. Keep away from this one",1
This medicine has made me have coughing and gagging spells day and night.  It also makes me dizzy.  I was told that I had post nasal drip.  No allergy medicine has helped.  I went off of the drug 5 days ago and I am still coughing but not as much.  I have been miserable and I will never take this drug again.  It is a horrible drug!,3
My blood pressure has been steadily increasing while taking this medication.,2
Blood pressure still is high.,2
"Although the medicine was successful in lowering BP, for over a month I thought I had an allergy or serious cold due to heavy coughing, runny nose and eye irritation. These symptoms arose a couple of weeks after I started taking the lisinopril.  Called Doctor and changing meds.    ",4
it has made my quality of life much better,5
"Like a great many others, I have allergy type symtoms since starting this drug. Watery eyes, runny nose, and a itchy dry cough that is driving me insane. I will be getting off of this soon. It did lower my BP though.",4

My PMD recently added Lisinopril to my HTN therapy. Soon afterwards I began to have a dry hacking cough. A friend alerted me about the possible side effects of HTN medication. I've been on amlodipine/norvasc for a number of years without dry coughing. The only new medication I recently had was Lisinopril. The cough became so bad that I had to go to the ER. XR was negative no PNA of infiltrates. I was put on Zithromax and then prednisone because of pulmonary complications. I am stopping the medication.,1

"I started off at 10mg the 1st month. Saw little change in BP other than higher pulse rate. Dr increased to 20mg. After about 3 weeks began getting rash with blisters all over my body. Also sun sensitivity and extreme lethargy, as well as trouble breathing. Intensified my asthma condition and my pulse was well over 100 at times of the least exertion. Rash is still healing even though I stopped taking the med 2 weeks ago. My pulse is back to 72 and other symptoms subsiding. My BP is not all high but I must take for kidney condition.

"The side effects of Lisinopril were worse than the benefits. I was on this drug for 30 days. Starting on the 3rd day, I had constant headaches and dry coughs. I needed to take 3-4 doses of Excedrin daily just to function. The coughing made it hard to sleep. My mouth and throat were constantly dry, which lead to drinking a lot of water, so bathroom visits also increased. I also felt lethargic - no motivation to do anything.  On the positive side, it did keep my blood pressure in check, averaging 117/74, which is the only reason I rated it three stars for effectiveness.  Doctor's staff told me that most HBP medication can lead to E.D. problems. This was very true of Atenolol. With Lisinopril, I was able to get an erection, but could not maintain it for as long as needed. Hoping the next med will be better.",3

When I began taking it again I felt terrible, legs hurt, face and throat were flush. I felt as though something heavy was weighing me down. I also noticed joint pains which I had previously, but had disappeared once I stopped taking Lisinopril although I had not associated it.  I was only when I began taking it again that I thought the Lisinopril may be causing the pains and the cough is back.  I will have to change again I think.",3

This is the first time I have ever been on anything on a regular basis so reading all of these reviews have been very helpful. ,4
"I have been on this drug for nearly 2 years. I awakened this morning with a swollen tongue. The swelling continued to the point I had to be taken to the Emergency Room and treated with antihistimine and sterooids to combat the swelling. I am  on a steroid and an antihistimine for the next 5 days and have been instructed to see my family  physician concerning the medications. I was told by both ER Drs. that although it was rare, the swolllen tongue was a side effect of the medication.",5
"I have been taking this med for about a week and I feel wierd and disconnected. I like others have experienced the dry cough and didn't know where it was coming from. I feel lightheaded at times and dizzy at others. I hadn't associated it with this drug until I started reading the reviews. To the other person, I also take a diuretic, but I think it's just the lisinopril that makes me feel this way ",3

I developed a rash like poison oak on my cheeks.I was told that it has sulfa and I was allergic to it. I was moved to Benazepril. The same symptoms as Lisinopril but had a dry sore cough and same lack of energy. My Dr. wanted to move me yet to another med in the same pril family. I'd had it. I was exhausted from lack of sleep, the cough, and no energy. My BP was only slightly lower. I had to keep a bag of cough drops on my night stand and was using them all night long. A friend told me about her success with Atenolol. It is a beta blocker which does not pass the blood brain barrier or the central nervous system. Therefore, avoiding side effects. I do not have any of the side effects of Linosinopril. For me the ""Pril"" family was a terrible experience!      ",2

Allergist told her they could last for years from this ""helpful medication"".  I was also given this med...irretractible diahrrea, nausea, and suprise suprise, HIVES.  Norvasc has almost none of the same side effects as lisinopril, so why are Doctors pushing this drug 50% more than any other?

I have started coughing very violently since taking this drug.  Is this a side effect?,3
This medication has been perfect for controlling my high blood pressure.,5
drops my pressure to much,1
"this med worked well on my BP however, about three weeks of taking this I developed a wicked cough and after three months had to change to another med because the cough was so bad.",5
I have been taking this med for about 4 months. Dry cough seem to have gotten better. However i have developed hip joint pain. also very painful upper foot pad just below my toes. I think it could be Gout. Never had before. going back to Doc ,3
BLOOD PRESSURE WASNT CONTROLLED AND AFTER ALMOST 6 MONTHS ONT HTE DRUG I ASKED DOCTOR TO TAKE ME OFF OF IT...THE COUGH WAS HORRIBLE....DIDNT KNOW IT WAS THE CAUSE..BUT 2 DAYS AFTER GOING OFF LISINOPRIL COUGH WAS GONE..THEY SHOULD TAKE THIS MED OFFF THE MARKET,2
Had such extreme side effects had to stop after 3 weeks.,1
I was prescribed 20mg of lisinopril for elevated blood pressure. After two weeks my blood pressure was extremely elevated and I had developed a very rapid and unregular heartbeat. I am no longer taking this drug.,1
"makes me dizzy,and cough   high blood pressure and water retintion",1
I have had success in keeping my blood pressure under control with this medication.,5
"I was Lisinopril-HCTZ 12.5 MG for about a year with no know problems, but when I switched to a new PCP he noted elevated levels of protein in the urine, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine(1.86). The new PCP increased the Lisinopril to 25 MG and had lab work done on me about every four months.  Each following lab report showed all three conditions getting worse(creatinine 2.08).   My cardiologist changed the RX from Lisinopril to Amlodipine and ordered more lab work.  After six days on Amlodipine the results of the lab test showed improvement in all three conditions and creatinine dropped to 1.86. ",5
I took Lisinopril 2.5mg five weeks ago for three weeks and took blood test. My kidney creatinine went up. I continued with this medication for another two weeks for blood test and my creatinine went up further again. I had side affects of dry cough and  increased of number of kidney function. I talked to my doctor and stopped taking this medication.,4
"Have never had such severe night time cramping before in my life. Muscles, for no apparent reason, suddenly tie up like a knot. Dr.'s seem dismissive when reported, and do not appreciate the severe pain that such cramps cause.  Never had cramps prior to taking this med.  So which is better possible affects of high blood pressure or continual, severe cramping? ",4
WORKS WELL.. BUT MY BUDGET NEEDS A GENERIC MED.  THERE IS NONE.  I CANNOT TAKE THE ;PRILLS,4
"3 years into using 10 mg w/effective reduction of HBP and no side effects, I had 5 episodes of swelling of tongue, lips, cheek at intervals of about one month, the 5th one most severe. Scary, but never any respiratory compromise. No allergic hx, no known association w/food or anything else.  Allergy testing was negative.  Inference that lisinopril was the likely culprit.  Discontinued Rx; am now on amlodopine 5 mg, so far so good.",5
"I cannot believe this drug is still on the market. Over 2000 comments here, about 90% complain of severe dry hacking cough. I developed the cough within days of starting and the cough went away just as quickly when I stopped taking lisinopril. This drug should not even be considered as medication. It is mostly ineffective with very bad side effects, but it is cheap.",1
"This medication did not work for me.  I was only on 2.5mg with Lopressor 50mg, but 4 days after I started it, I was not doing well.  I was dizzy, very tired, weak and had a headache that would last most of the day, almost everyday.  I think the worst of it was when I called my cardiologist to report this and get some help, and I was told that this medicine doesn't cause the symptoms I was having.  EVEN THOUGH all the literature I've read and received with the med from the pharmacy says otherwise.  I felt unheard and dismissed.  I stopped the med and no longer use that cardiologist....I feel better...",2
I developed a cough which became more frequent. The cough would wake me up and bothersome during the day with clients.,3
"Dry hacking cough even popped a rib, bery painful when I cough, will not continue with this pill",2
has helped my bp tremendously,4
My blood pressure is still high-taking HZTZ as well. I am seriously concerned about heart attacks due to family history but no one else seems to be too concerned? I have tried so many drugs to control this-no insurance so hard to keep going to the doctor? Do  need a stronger Rx?,3
"I've been taking this medication along with a ""water pill"".  I have severe muscle weakness and a pain in the middle of my chest after I eat.  Must be indigestion or something.  Very light headed when I stand up or bend over.  I'm not sure if I like this drug or not.  I guess my body is still getting use to it.  Have the dry hacking cough but it's not too bad.  I do get nauseated which is something new as well.  My BP is fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere from 190/132 to 98/72.  Hopefully it will all even out soon!",3
Took One 2.5 pill and was so dizzy that I could not walk for the next 12 hours.,1
Dry cough is sometimes annoying but a sugar-free Halls drop helps. no other side effect.,4
"The medicine worked fine, but it gave me a cough that was constant.  It kept me up at night, and was very bothersome in the workplace.",4

"No problems starting and for 5 years, but now wondering if it could be contributing to heartburn??",5
Worked very well in lowering my blood pressure. It also aids in kidney function. the only downside is a very mild cough associated with this drug. My physician informed me this would likely occur. It is not a hacking cough but usually experienced within a half hour of taking the drug,5
"It's difficult to say anything good about this drug. I am still bothered by abnormally high blood pressure, both diastolic and systolic. But, I am also a psychiatric patient, and suffer from heart failure issues, as well. I find that while on this drug, simple stretching and movement exercises leave me feeling faint, with hot burning muscles. I have experien ced vertigo, and I have been admitted into the cardiac icu on one occasion recently. Also, I black out, and feel faint with moderate exercise. I have difficulty sleeping on several occasions, and can't stay asleep. Also, I bloat, and feel uncomfortable with tight clothing, altho, no swelling in the ankles yet. I wish I could have some relief from these side-effect type conditions before they kill me. ",1

"i am a 53yrold diabetic , and i have no [problems with this drug.  I take it for prevention of kidney trouble.",5
"took this medication for about 2 1/2 to 3 years. the slight cough did not bother me that much. Last summer it got worse and with bouts of nausea. Then i developed a severe rash on my head and neck. Then my hands and back also developed a severe rash. After going to my doctor 3 times for the rash, I decided to get a second opinion. It was the lisinopril! they since changed my prescription, but the tissue damage from the rashes will take a long time to heal. oh, my 1st doctor blamed it on hormones then treated me for scabies. he is no longer my doctor!",5
was switched to this by ins. co. from benicar. after 3 mo. ended up in hosp.with acute pancreatitus  ,4
My systolic blood pressure came down 30 mm after being placed on this drug and my diastolic pressure came down 20mm after being placed on this drug.  I feel so much better now.  Before being placed on this drug I used to feel little sharp acute pain in my chest but not anymore seen being placed on my bp med because my bp was to high.  Extremely sastified with my medicine.,5
"my doctor just swicth me to this brand,I used to take different brand of lisonopril[smaller in size than this and diffrent color,which I work fine,the same dozzage,been taking it for 15 years],now I am coughing a lot ,runny nose,and all the symptom of cold,I have'nt talk to my doctor yet.",5
I haven't been on long enought to have comments,4
Seems alright,4
"Have been on this several years, doc. recently doubled dose. Have suffered with sinus symtoms,post nasal drip, violent coughing, gagging, eyes and nose running. Several bouts a day, and also through the night. Doc. says its allergies, no help from several allergy meds. I have stopped taking and see some lessening of symptoms. Actually slept through two nights without the usual several coughing FITS.. I am monitoring my BP and have seen no increase since going off the stuff!! My coughing episodes are enough to cause a Stroke... I don't plan to take any more.",3
I have been taking this medication for the last 6 months and it is GREAT! I had a little annoying coughand it lasted about 1 month and now it is gone. I highly recommend this drug!,5
lowers bp but the chronic dry cough (which appreared only after 6 months of use) is disruptive and annoying.  I am done with this!,3
No side effects at all and I feel great!,4
"Starting having headaches so bad it was hard to go to sleep.(I take med at bedtime) I couldn't figure out why, and by process of elimination, I figured out its this medication. I won't be taking this anymore.",2
At 10mg/daily it reduced systolic 15pts. and diastolic 10 pts.  No side effects.  I was out of it for the first two weeks of use.,5
" I took one 10mg pill AT 9 AM BP WAS 170/105By 4pm my bp had dropped to92/60  felt like i was dying.headacks loss of energy.upset stomack ,and i feel like im in a daze. Have not taken drug in four days and my bp is 120/75  will never take again",5
"I was recently diagnosed with hypertension and this drug was prescribed. I was very pleased with the fact that I paid less than two dollars for a ninety day supply. It also reduced my blood pressure, but the side effect of coughing was too much for me so I reluctanly had to switch to another medication. If I didn't have coughing fits for hours I would have remained on this medication. Thank you",4
"my bp has been trending higher the last few years so when it checked 146/92, my dr again suggested treatment and i finally agreed after refusing for about 2 years. because when i check my bp at home it was usually lower, but often still in pre high range 130/80s. I eat good and exercice often and I am afraid of how dangerous high bp can be. Taking drug for 1 week and my bp close to normal, no side effects. 10mg. ",5
"Been taking it for 2 years, 20mg but doctor recently reduced it to 5mg.  Still effective and no side effects at all. ",5
Cannot tell if it has made any difference after heart stent.,3
woke up and my lips were swellen,5
My first time ever being on any medication on a daily basis.  My age is 53. I've been on medication for 3 months.  All of a sudden I have a continuous cough. May have to change med. Seems to keep BP in reasonable range.,4
This medication does not work alone I take 2 other medications to control my blood pressure.,3
"prescribed to ""protect "" my kidneys/ just want to learn more about it.",1
not a problem until I developed the cough. My doctor took me off it and put me on another prescription and no cough. Had to increase dosage but works fine now,5
This medication does not control my high blood pressure. My pressure still stay in the range of 130-150 and I take my medciation each and every day along with a water pill but my blood pressure still has not gotten better. Along with my pressure still not being good this medication makes me cough all the time. I hate it and when I see my doctor she will be taking me off of this because she was thinking that I had lung cancer or something. The coughing was so bad that she was sending me to get CT scan and xrays done of my chest and they found nothing. My mother has been coughing like this for almost 10 years and come to find out she takes the exact same medication for high blood as I do. I will no longer be taking this medication in about a week.,2
"Just started taking this med only about a month ago. It has worked wonders on my blood pressure!! It's perfect and I'm a diabetic. I still get some periods of dizziness, a little nausea, and my head feels funny sometimes. I can feel it working. Not sure if this is related or not, but I have been having heart palpitations,will tell my dr about that.  Overall, it looks like a wonder drug. I have to say, I see a lot of people wrote about this chronic coughing as a side effect. Honestly, I think, only the very first two days I had a little dry cough, but since then I have NO coughing at all!  This is a wonder drug if you are looking for one! Overall, very happy",5
i have to write a review on this medicine. I do not take it but my husband did. He is a truck driver and he developed a terrible cough that it got to be to dangerous for him to drive. His coughs got so bad that he was on the brink of passing out sometimes. So he had to get off of it a week ago still has cough but not as bad hopefully it goes away real soon. This is a dangerous drug for anyone that drives or uses machinery for a living. ,2
"I give only 3 stars for satisfaction because of the horrible cough I have to deal with.  The coughing racks my entire body, sore ribs, back and at time I feel as I will pass out.  Mr. Dr. said it was from post nasal drip, took various meds and cough syrups but nothing helps.  I cannot tolerate this drug because of the cough.  I sound like someone who smokes 5 packs a day.  If I'm out in public I have to leave the room.",4
"Dry cough is persistent and annoying. I have soreness in my chest, but overall it seems to work well",4
"I have taken this med for about 3 months and it has done wonders for my BP.  My BP was 235/115 and it is now 135/85.  At first I was on 20 mg and am now on 40 mg.  At first I had dizzyness, diarrhea and lightheadedness, but those have gone away.  I still have the cough which makes me gag sometimes, but that is the only side effect I have left.  I asked the dr if there was anything I could do about that and he said no.  I thought the longer I took the med, that the cough would go away as well.  I would recommend this med to anyone with high BP.  It has brought down my BP 100 points on top and 30 points on the bottom.  No other BP med has ever done what this drug has done for me.",5
Gave me severe indigestion & Heartburn,3
"numerous side effects dizzyness,",2
At first I did  have a dry cough but that went away in about a month.  The cough was not bad enough to make me stop the medication.  The best part is that I have experianced NO sexual side effects and that is great.  My wife and I have a great relationship and didn't want medication interfering with it.,4
blood pressure still elevate sometimes ,3
"i started with 2.5mg in 1995 then it increased to 5mg in 2001 and 10mg in 2007 finally doctor suggested me to change medicine, it has no side effect but it really never kept my bp in 120/80 range,it has remained 150~160/85~100 and lately it was above 100, partly i can blame my less sleep and over work and smoking (4-5 cig a day)",2
/took this for 1 month and briught my blood pressure down to normal,4
I have used it for year at least and I still high days.,2
it was prescribed for hypertension. ive been using it over two months and have had no changed to my blood pressure. i've followed dietary changes and lifestyle changes to no effect,1
Was unaware I had high blood pressure until I had a routine exam.  I hadn't been to the doctor in 5 years and am in great health.  My BP was 160/110! Felt immediate relief with the first dosage (10 mg 1x daily).  No side effects and feel great!,5
"Very effective in controlling high blood pressure and eliminating headaches, but could not tolerate intense daily coughing and associated gagging and vomiting..have not found a good substitute yet.",4
developed cough and bad sinus infection  lasting more than 4 months.  dr. denied lisinopril could be cause.  after talking to other users I stopped lisinopril and am slowing recovering.  ,4
"My mother had been using lisinopril for years with no problems, until last week.  She developed an allergic reaction to the drug.  She was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  Emergency room physicians made my mother and I aware that allergic reactions to this drug is common among black americans.  My mother's tongue was so swollen that she could not talk.  It was horrifying.  She called me a work to let me know what was happening. I could not understand her on the phone.  It's a blessing that she was able to get to the hospital in time for to begin an IV of benadryl. She was transferred to ICU to receive monitoring.  She was unable to drink or eat. She was in the hospital for two days.  Her medication was been changed.  I'm taking lisinopril too, but I will be contacting my doctor to change my medication asap. I strongly advise anyone taking this medication to think twice about taking it, because you never know if you will develop an allergic reaction. ",3
I started taking this about 2 weeks ago.  Doctor started me on 5 mg but my blood pressure went too low.  I now take 2.5 mg and no problems with side effects and bp stays good.  The dose is so low I may not feel any sie effects.,5
The side effects of extreme dizziness and light headedness were baffling.   I felt as if I was on a powerful drug and had no choice.  My quality of life diminished.  I hated the feeling of loss of control in my life.  ,2
blood pressure remains hogh,3
I have endured a lot of illnesses and injuries in my life but none of them were as bad as the constant migraine headache that this drug has given me over the past five days!!!  As I sit here writing I feel as though I am getting hit in the head with a brick.,2
caused sever caughing and had to stop taking.,4
"I have been taking this med for a little over a month and have had dry, hacking cough to the point of vomiting, tiredness, diarrhea, and headaches.  I'm hoping it gets better the longer I take it.  I usually have side effects for a while, then they stop.  My dr just increased the dosage from 20mg to 40mg.  I guess I'll see how it is in another month.",1
Ihave had no problems with the medication since taking it for about 10 years .,5
"Causes an annoying dry cough! but is cheap, alternative was $71 for 30 days!! Lisinopril, is about $4.!",3
hypertension controlled ,4
Frequent urge to urinate.,4
"On it for years and have a chronic cough along with problems with my vocal cords, loss of hair, night sweats.  Went to an ENT and he told me to call my MD to have him prescride a non ace inhibitor.

"I've taken lisinopril for a number of years and about a year ago, it seemed that it was no longer effective.  My blood pressure was staying high.  I quit taking it, and have discovered that the cough I had, the tiredness and exhaustion and dizziness that all had been attributed to allergies, is now gone and I have more energy than I have ever had.  I cannot believe I've lived with this for so many years when I could have gotten rid of all the ""allergy"" symptoms by discontinuing use of lisinopril!",3
I was put on Lisinopril 20 mg a little over a year ago. I love it! No complaints. It may work so well because I'm young. Even being healthy didn't get me away from genetics. ,5
"Although it helped to regulate my blood pressure, this medication caused a serious cough, with episodes of vomiting.",5
"Blood pressure came right down and I was happy, but didn't feel well and could not get rid of dry hacking cough.  Thought it was making my asthma worse, but pharmacist said I was not tolerating it.",3
"I took lisinopril for less than 6 mo; it gave a dry hacking cough and was completely ineffective for high BP. My doctor thought I had COPD, but the cough went away within 1 week after I stopped taking lisinopril. I have taken many meds for BP over the past 30 yrs, this was the worst!",1
As I am on several medications it is hard for me to really tell if this medication is working. According to my doctor I am not go off of it.,4
"The drug reduces my HBP as regularly checked, no side effect noted as of today",4
Interacts badly,1
Came down with a very bad cough with pressure from the head the harder I coughed the more server worse it got for me to withstand. went to a allergy specialist who suggest going with a different med signed T T,5
"Been on this med for 2 months and am starting to experience anxiety and knee pain, and have had dizzy spells since I started.  When I bend over, as soon as I stand up I become very dizzy.  I am continually tired.  Overall it's done wonders for my blood pressure, but the side effects are questionable as whether I can tolerate them.    ",5
"Extreme itching, hand pain esp. right hand, extreme left calf throbing pain like that of a nerve conduction test, headache, sinus pain in face, bad pain in kidneys, bone aching severe, feelings of ""dumb"" and detachment from reality, took the Lisinopril 40 mg tab for about two months suffering began within a week but could not figure out what was causing it as thoughts were eratic and ""dumb"" feeling, stopped taking pill by self for the past three weeks feeling better had a physical, sugar level increase, blood pressure increase, measuring blood pressure at home to give to doctor, I would not - ever recommend this medication for anyone. Back to the doctor this Thursday for another report, blood pressure still high, hope there is no permanent damage in time.",1
I've been taking this medication now for 3 weeks. Have started having severe abdominal and back pain. Feels like I've been punched in the kidneys. Going to call the doctor tomorrow and ask to try something else. The pain is not worth it.,3
"The only side effects that I don't like is that it leaves me feeling tired, and wanting to sleep. It has been very effective in lowering my blood pressure.",4
"I coughed NON stop on this medication. It disturbed my sleep, eating, and socialization. It was terrible. I would cough so hard, I felt like I was going to have an asthma attack! I switched to another B/P med and the coughing went away.",5
Constant loose stool,5
"Taking this pill has brought my BP down to 125-130 levels but for the last 3 months I've been having headaches. Unusual because my head throbs painfully only when I cough, clear my throat or sneeze. Also this happens only when I am upright. If I cough when laying down, no pain. Any body else going through this?",3
I coughed day and night,1
"I took it for a while with no problems, got a kidney transplant and didn't need it anymore.  Once I lost the transplant and went back on it my tongue swelled up.  However, it was only half my tongue, one side swelled up so huge I couldn't talk and had to go to the er and get a shot. I can't take this anymore.",5
"After taking for a year, I noticed that I had a very dry cough. One morning, after taking my dose of 10mg, my tongue started swelling. I had to go to the ER where they changed my prescription. If it weren't for the tongue swelling, which was scary in itself, I would have continued to take this med.",4
"I used this medication for 6 months and while it controlled my blood pressure well I developed an irritated throat and cough,so I asked the doc to change the prescription.",5
My blood sugar went up after taking this drug is this normal.?,3
"Although this drug has helped me to maintain acceptable BP levels, I am experiencing aches and pains of a 70 year old and I am only 43. I try to stay active, but my knees and elbows have been aching after a couple of years on this drug. I cannot tolerate the cold like I used to either. I am convinced it is the medication.",5
I have started coughing and have thick clear mucus. It has started since taking the med. My father has the same problem. I didn't figure this out until today while reading the side effects. Any suggestions on a different med to take.,5
leg pain,3
"Bad Med! Severe Coughing in morning and Worse, During the Night! I was only on 5 mg and experienced horrible coughing and gagging with tooth brushing. Nightly Sleep Disruption and Morning Horrible Coughing! I want to ask my doctor if he would put his own mother through this torture!!!!",4
dosages difficult at times to determine resulting in hi-readings & low-readings b/p,3
"I am a 46 year old just recently diagnosed with high blood pressure.  My doctor recommended started me out on using Lisinopril.  After using this medicine for a few days, I suffered the worst case of severe swelling throught my lips and face area.  I immediately stopped taking Lisinopril and notified my doctor.  My doctor has since prescribed a better medciation.",1
"First time using this product.  Still getting use to the side effects, and how it helps my blood pressure come down. I am looking forward to getting my pressure down, and living a long life even if I have to continue taking this product for a long time.",5
I had taken this medication for about 4 weeks and just recently have had the WORST problems with coughing and gaging! This has caused me to not get much sleep and never know when it will strike. I have stop the medication after talking to my doctor and the coughing fits STILL continue. Im so over it! When will it ever end??? My doctor still hasnt done anything about putting me on something else!,3
i stayed tired and my bones hurts,4
"I'm 32yo and have recently been diagnosed with hypertension.  It runs heavily in my family for those family members that are obese.  I am active, fit and a healthy eater.  My doctor checked my kidney function levels prior to starting the Lisinopril HCTZ and they were normal.  Then my 2wk bloodwork after taking the med showed extreme high kidney levels but my blood pressure is great.  So my doc changed my prescription without the diaretic (HCTZ) and see how it works and do bloodwork in 2 wks.  I would advise everyone on any blood pressure med to make sure your doctor is checking your kidney functions.",4
"Since on this for 2 weeks blood pressure went from 190/? coupled with severe migraines and swelling, to below the nromal range.  I feel better, not taking ibuprofen for pain and swelling. Haven't taken excedrin migraine in the 2 weeks.  Still taking Xanax for the stress, but what a world of difference for me.",5
It was very effective in lowering my high blood pressure but I got very tired of coughing. I have now changed medication as of today.,5
"Exterme sleepiness, really bad rash, lots of congestion. Was taking a generic form and had none of these problems.",5
"I was given this medications for high blood pressure and took it for 2 weeks. I began to have intense cravings for salt and spicy food. I also severe from depression and take an antidepressant for it. Over the two weeks I was on the medication, I became more and more depressed. It got to the point where I couldn't control my emotions. My tears were unstoppable. My doctor told me to stop taking the medication nd he switched me to a calcium channel blocker and increased my antidepressant. I researched more the connection between diuretics, salt cravings, and depression and discovered the diuretic in Lisinopril was ridding my body of salt; hence, my intense salt craving. I also discovered that salt is considered the body's natural anti-depressant which explains my deterioration in mood. Also, discovered that intense salt cravings means that you are probably deficient in sodium and low blood sodium levels can be fatal so if you have intense salt cravings you should give your body what it wants and have your blood sodium levels checked. I would not recommend this medication to any that suffers from depression. I went completely haywire and couldn't make through any day at work this week. I am starting to feel better. I am excited about the Calcium channel blocker because it helps prevent chest pain which has been my major complaint. My blood pressure hovers a little over 140/90 with the 2nd number being the highest. I didn't notice significant drops in blood pressure with Lisinopril which could be because of the extra salt I was adding. I did notice some weight loss while on lisinopril that made me happy. I will miss the weight loss but it is not worth running around like a crazy salt addict crying uncontrobly. Depression isn't a recognized side effect of Lisinopril but it should be. ",2
blood sugar levels have dropped from high 300's to 150 or less since I started taking this drug with insulin.dont understand why.havent chaged anything else.i guess it is working.,5
o.k.,5
"Wow, I am surprised, I came to research this medication becasue of the extreme pain, fatigue and hand pain, dumbness. I cannot believe all the others that experience the same exact thing. I had no idea. I have been taking this medication for over 5 years, the dr. has just recently doubled by dsg to 80 mgs 2x a day. No wonder I feel so awful. Thanx people out there without your feedback I would have never guessed that it was the side effect of this medicine. I can hardly use my right hand. I cant believe this. I take 80 mgs of lisinipril, .4 mg of Clonidine, and 100 mg of Metropolol, daily.",3
caused serious dozziness,2
"As I sit and write this I have intervals of coughing and gagging.  At first I thought I was getting a cold, blew my nose all the time and had post nasal drip which caused the coughing.  I never got a cold and the coughing continues. I have given this about 6 weeks so I'm going in next week and see if I can try something else.  I am tired of not knowing when I am going to have a ""coughing attack"" and I am sucking on throat lozenges all the time.  I hope this all clears up when I switch to something else. BP has been ""ok"" but I have had some times where it has spiked up but if everyone took their BP as much as I do, maybe everyone spikes throughout the day, especially during the elections or thinking of the many stresses of our lives.",3
I NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS PILL. I HAVE TAKING THIS PILL FOR 3 YEARS NOW.  IT WORK GOOD.,5
"I was on this for about 6 months, began with a cough but I have allergies so thought it was just allergy related. Other people have told me they had the same coughing. Hoped it would get better but once it began effecting my sleep, had to change.  Also had a headache alot and caused my heart to race and pulse to be high.",2
is cheap and works very well with exercise in keeping BP down.  Also take klonipin to help.,5
"I don't like this medication, I've had a dry cough that causes me to choke and tear up episodes, wakes me up outta my sleep with spinning dizzines, and anxiety attacks,I'm wondering, is there something else I have... NO, it's just a creepy side effect. I'd rather run a mile every day, than gain more medical conditions...I'm stopping ASAP...",3
very satisfied ,4
I have not noticed any side effects from this medication but my pressure is 120/73 so it is working also have diabetes.,5
"Yeah it brought down my BP but I can't sleep or eat. I barely urinate twice a day..can't focus at home or at work. can't keep down any food, always hungry because of the nausea. Sweating more that I do after a 2 mile jog. All of this after 4, yes only 4 days on 20mg of this stuff. Please proceed with caution.",4
"I took this drug 5 hours later in icu on vent for 1 wk in coma 2 weeks home back in icu this time had a trach in for 7 months part of my throat taken out,speech ,now can't smell all due to this drug, take it and risk your life cough,sweat, no sleep if you like these effects keep taking it long term use you will get these,now still suffering from the effects of this drug it has been on the recall list but they keep it on the market because it make the company billions of dollars and we as people are the one who pay the price, did nothing for my blood pressure but almost killed me.",1
I have been taking Lisinopril (10mg)for approx. 4yrs and it has brought my BP down from approx. 170/110 to 120/80. I did have the dry cough when I started taking Lisinopril but that only lasted for about 2wks.  I have had no problems at all after that first 2wks. I had been taking atenolol 50mg and did not like it at all compared to Lisinopril.  Lisinopril does not have the instant rebound effect that atenolol has if you forget a dose. And did not cause any of the racing heart beat effect that atenolol would give to me.,5
works ok,3
"since i have been on this medication i am able to function better, i was having a slight headache when i first started. but it went a way .. i feel relaxed not nauseaed ....it does allow me to urine frequently.i am more alert and focus on my 8-5 job....   ",5

"This drug almost took my life. It caused me to faint/pass out while traveling 65 mph on I-68W in Maryland. I left the road & smashed head on into a rock wall. I suffered a fracture of the cervical spine, a broken sternum, two cracked ribs & four teeth knocked out. I'm lucky for having great medical care. I was off work for six months. I am in pain daily but lucky I'm not dead or in a wheel chair. Pat Reynolds ",1
"I experienced dizziness, swelling in the ankles and hands.  I stopped taking it and feel better now.  Now I take something else and it is much easier on me.",4
Slow to perform,2
"While taking this drug I had symptoms for Lupus and a false positive for Lupus. Stopped taking the drug and all symptoms are gone and test came back normal. It says in the side effects as a possible effect Lupus type symptoms, my Dr was ready to treat me for lupus until he did a little more research... so glad he did! ",4

I take this medication for hypertennsion I experience rapid heart beat!!What should I do?  I'm also dibetic [email protected],2
i've always thought lisiopril was great for my high blood pressure but my new Doctor noticed i had been taking it for 4 years after a visit because my blood pressure was starting to be higher than usual  he put me on benacar 40/25 i never had a  water rention until i started taking it ,5
"for 15 months my lisonpril dose was 5 mg and my blood pressure was constant at 125/65 (average per day per month). After Aortic Valve Relacement and Aortic Anuerysm repair, 4 months ago,  my dose is now 40 mg and my blood pressure range is all over the spectrum. The dosage increase has been incremental but doesn't seem to be treating the condition. This counter intuitive to me - get fixed and need 8 times the dose yet it hasn't corrected the symptom.",2
a caugh come at nite,4
I feel tired all the time?,2
"OMG, WHAT IS THIS TASTE in the back of my tongue? Something died and decayed back there.",3

Lisinopril has been very effective for my high b/p however....I have developed a horrific cough that is unbearable. Wake up coughing so hard at night i can barely breathe and my back and stomach muscles are constantly sore due to cough. ,4

it has helped,4
Diareia,3
"I take 20 MG DAILY, IT DOES NOT LOWER MY bp",2
"I have been on Lisinopril (10 mg daily) for about 10 years. It has left me with a terrible cough, constant dry mouth, fatigue, depression, leg cramps, abdominal pain, headaches,  and neck pain.  It did lower blood pressure, for the most part, but I still got tightness and pain in chest and upper back making it hard to breathe from time to time (they doubled the dosage). The side effects ARE NOT worth it! My overall health has severely declined since being on this medication.  I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Asthma, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sjogren's Syndrome (dry mouth), and have gained about 100 lbs.  Doctors were treating me for so many other things, instead of just changing the medication, with the known side effects, but I guess that's how they make their money. I am no longer taking it.  I just hope it doesn't have lasting side effects, and I can get on with my life and be happier & healthier, now.",3
this pill works great for my high blood pressure but i often get a cough/or dry chocking feeling some times 2-s3 times in an hr. lasting what feel like 2 long. I Wish i did not get this side effect  i am going to have to change pills,5
"I have been taking 20mg Lisiopril for over 2 years, i works great! no bad mood swings. I started taking Lisiopril hctz to help because my blood pressure was a little bit high again, so right now I am actively taking 20mg X2 Lisiopril hctz and 10mg almodopine. Blood pressure and great and NO BAD SIDE EFFECTS. The only bad thing is having to pee after drinking a glass of water because of the diuretic. :)",5
i was prescribed this medication 3 days ago after reading the reviews im scared to take it ,1
"I have been on this medication for a year. I have had severe side effects that the doctor says could not be the medication. I finally went to a heart specialist. It was determined I was over medicated. I started  taking 50mg. I had all of the severe side effects and more! I have been in the hospital twice this year. The last time was not a heart attack... it was a panic attack caused from blood pressure dropping to 80/34. I am now taking 2,5mg about every other day and it still drops to 90/54 in the evenings! I fight panic attack from the medication. I feel weak, dizzy and faint most of the time. I want to feel good again!",4
I wound up in the hospital because I could not stop coughing.  I cough so hard my lungs were damage temporarily and I damaged my vocal cords from the harsh coughing and usually I coughed until I threw up.  I don't recommend it at all.,1
cough,3
"The cough is unbearable, going back to get this medication changed.  Can sleep keep waking myself up coughing.",4
"I took this drug for about a year before the tickle and cough started. It drove me crazy, not to mention it was almost embarrassing. Trying something else now and the tickle and cough are gone.  Thank God!   ",4

"stopped taling 10 mg/d lisinopril 1 year ago.  tinnitus was unbearable - could not hear over the roar. no cough but lump in throat (swollen), diminished sense of taste & smell.  now on 1/2 Azor 5-20 - tried Benicar which eliminated tinnitus but pulse rose.  Azor effective, softer tinnitus, but zone-out in evening, bad sinus/ear infections, testosterone low, PSA up, some hair loss.  Diovan worse than lisinopril. IS there a solution without the grief?",4
"I am taking 10mg/12.5 hczt - Works wonders on my blood pressure however, I do get occasionally off centered and dizziness I have been on this drug for 1 1/2 years still have the above side effects no coughing thank god",5
"I have tried this drug before and all I do is cough, cough, and cough after two days worth.  It did lower my bp better than Benicar but the coughing is now causing asthma attacks, chest pain from the coughing and lack of sleep for myself and my husband.  The side effect of that alone is not worth it. ",3
 Has lowered my HBP but will look for a better pill due to bad cough & nasal drip.  I don't understand why this cough is not listed as a serious side effect.,4
caughing,3

Cardio doctor took me off this medication and put me on lisinopril 10 mg. a day and left me on HTCZ. My left foot started swelling in June and then my thigh in my left leg right above my knee has swollen. I had SEVERE pain in my knees caused by the Coreg and the pain is gone but my left leg is swollen still. Every since I started this lisinopril I have had my asthma flare up, and it rarily bothers me. I feel my chest in my bhroncial area tighten up and I cough until I use my inhaler. I am reading all of these others side effects to this drug. It's pretty scarey & my left calf is starting to swell too. Is any one else out there having trouble with just one leg swelling? I had tests ran & it's not my heart. Please email me at [email protected] if you have had these side effects.",4
"I have been on Lisinopril (3/5 mg daily) for about 4 months.  It has left me with a terrible cough,  constant dry mouth and these symptoms have not gotten much better even though I have been off it for 10 days. Did lower blood pressure but side effects not worth it.",3

Only gripe is having to half the tablet,5
"This medicine worked great for the first couple of months but after about 3 months the stomach pains started.  I experienced seasonal allergy feelings, dry cough, heartburn, indigestion, acid reflex, urine frequency increased and then the stomach pains started.  Once that started then the urgency and frequency for bowel movements also increased.  The pain then started in my lower back and got more intense in my lower stomach.  It also felt like I had a urinary tract infection.  The pain kept getting worse.  This is the second time I was on this medication and I had the same effects both times after a few months of being on this. Won't take this medication again.",3
"When I started taking this drug, I had a very heavy feeling, as though it ""slowed me down"". I also started having a dry mouth, dry cough, and after taking it for 3 months, the cough has become worse.

"I recently had my gall bladder removed. While I was in the hospital they started me on Lisinopril.  I am a diabetic. The day after the surgery I noticed my chest was red and hot to the touch, like a sunburn. As time went on I started peeling everywhere (even the palms of my hands and fingertips), some burning on my skin and itching. Could this be caused by this medication.? I can't afford to go to a dermatologists, I have no insurance.",3
"I have a persistent cough, feeling in my chest of heaviness and blurred vision.",1
Horrific coughing.  Went to dr and it was not identified as the problem.  Stopped taking medicine one week ago and coughing is slow to go away.  I literally hurt my back from coughing so much and have also had near accidents with bladder due to cough.,1
I have been on this medication for around 2 years and had a severe allergic reaction. It was severe enough that I had to go to the hospital because of my tongue & throat swelled and I was unable to swollow & had trouble breathing. After reading all about the medication I believe I should not have been put on it as I have COPD a severe breathing problem that should have been taken into consideration before prescribing this medication to me.,5
musical spasm's,2
Increased urine flow. Had to urinate every 45 minutes to one hour. Normal was twice a day and before I went to bed. I Stopped taking after 14 days and urine flow has returned to normal.,1
"After taking this about 4 yrs, have now developed lower stomach pain that never goes away..Just like a nagging toothache. Had medical test and everything came back normal.  Still having pain.",5
"My blood pressure stated to elevate after being diagnosed with Breast Cancer and going thru raidaiton treatments (no doubt stress)..My Dr prescibed Antenol, which I took for a few months but did not like the extreme fatigue, combined with taking Tamoxifen, so she swithched me to 5mg of Lisinopril. I seem to have more energy, but the cough I have developed is very annoying and has me very concerned, because of constant chest pains, and when you have been diagnosed with cancer right away I am thinking the worse....these reviews has eased my mind quite a bit, Thank You... I am going back in to see my cancer Dr, just to make sure and then  follow up with my regular Dr. I rather this med than the Antenol. ",4
"since starting on this medication 3 months ago, I seem to tire more easliy. Does anyone else have this symptom?",5
"I have taken this medication for over 20 years. It has controlled my bp very well over those years..I do, however, develop several coughs every year. Is it related? I never thought so until I began reading other reviews of this drug.",5
After a major stroke I made serious lifestyle changes.  When diet and exercise failed to lower BP enough the Dr. advised 10 mg daily. BP is under control.  I have had intermittant dry cough.  I drink at least 80oz water daily and this helps keep me hydrated and avoiding muscle cramps. ,5
"The cough.  Good golly, the cough I could NOT get rid of till I quit this med.  And I miss it because I think it was helping to curb my appetite.  I tried to take 1 lisinopril after being switched to Norvasc and the cough was back that very nite.  Now I'm on Norvasc and it seems to be working but I never take my b.p. and my appetite is coming back which is bad, I've gained weight fast.  Can't these companies make a drug that doesn't have side effects???",4
Provoked daily leg cramps and caused me sharp pain in my left flank area.,1
"When taking this medication (2.5mg)I have acquired extremely bad upper back burning sensation with pain and tranferring to center part of chest. The burning sensation in chest feels like a heart attack. I complained to my Cardiologist and was told to keep using it and as in fact, was told to use twice a day. I finally stopped using it and 3 days after I stopped, the pain dissappeared. For me personally, the cons outweighed the benefits. I wish everyone luck with this medication but for me it had very little to no effect.",2
This med did not keep my pressure control without a good diet also.,3
"I was taken off Chlorthalidone, a diuretic because of a slight drop in my postassimum and sodium levels and put on Lisinopril. I am on some mdications that cause some bladder constipation and the Chlorthalidone took care of that problem completely. I could finally urinate completely. I also lost pounds of water weight.  When the doctor called about the potassium levels, which were not bad at all, but she said why deal with it all if we don't have to? I stopped the Chlorthalidone and began the Lisinopril. Within one day I couldn't urinate, I had leg cramps that frightened me and felt totally out of it and dizzy. I didn't suffer from a cough, but that is because I stopped the drug, went back on the Chlor.(which had gotten my B.P under control)and began taking supplements and eating bananas.  I feel fine after a week back on the 1st medication and now have to call my Dr. to tell her what I have done. However, no matter *what* she says I will NOT go back on Lisinopril.",3

"Thank you to everyone that has left a review. I have been dealing with bad cough for almost 4 months. It is so bad I have vomited and wet myself (I am only 37) Co-workers are concerned. I have been to my regular doctor several times for the coughing and I have been directed to see a lung specialist. My cough started around 2 weeks after starting taking this. Other problems are leg cramps and trouble sleeping. I am going to stop this medicine, and hopefully I can get better. It is amazing that my doctor didnt tell me of these side effects and my cough could be from this medication. I will no longer see this doctor.",1

Off med for 10 days and still not 100%.",2
"To treat my hypertension, my doctor first gave me a water pill, which wasn't effective. I started with 10 mg. of Lisinopril, which marginally brought my blood pressure down, so my doctor upped it to 20mg., this has been very effective. The only noticeable side effect is I sometimes have a cough, but not enough to be bothersome.",5

"After topping out at 156/84, and my bp rising steadily over a nine-month span, my doctor decided to put me on lisinopril. The only problems I had were leg pains in the first two weeks of treatment. The pain wasn't debilitating, but it was enough to cause discomfort to the point of having change my position and causing difficulty in sleeping at night. Other than that, I've been pleased. I can feel the difference when I relax and just listen to and feel my heart beating.",4

As a physician I know the importance of treating high blood pressure.  I have taken Lisinopril for over a year and my doctor increased the dose once. My blood pressure is under good control and I feel better having also made some lifestyle changes to lose weight.,4
"I have been on this medication for 6 weeks now at 10 mg. I have found that I have increased anxiety, rapid heart rate and trouble sleeping. I also take thyroid medication and have found that I have to space the medications out at least 12 hours apart, and I always take my BP medication with food. I am sensitive to medications and have been for the last 10 yrs. I have tried talking with my doctor about lowering the dosage, but with no success as of yet. I feel that my blood pressure problems are largely due to my hypothyroidism not being treated as it should be. I had no problems for 6 yrs when on a different thyroid medication. But its frustrating to get the doctors now days to listen to their patient, we know our bodies better than they do. But unfortunately doctors today are all about the lab results, and treating only the symptoms then they are about listening to their patients and finding out the actual cause of the problem. And for that, many of us suffer needlessly and are over medicated.   ",4
Keeps my blood pressure under control without any side effects.,5
"I took 10 mg of lisinopril in the morning. By afternoon, my blood pressure was so low I could hardly stand up. I experienced anxiety.

Not been able to get regulated yet.,3
"After taking 5 mg for over 15 years, I developed severe angioedema two weeks ago on 6/16/10.The emergency room doctor took one look at me and asked if I was taking Lisinopril. My face, lips, and throat were swelling up and it was difficult to breathe. I happened to be in a hospital lobby when it happened and a code blue was announced.I was informed this drug can cause these symptoms the first time you take it or after 20 to 30 years. I dealt with the dry cough all these years since the drug lowered my BP at low doses. I'm still recovering two weeks.  ",4
I take lisnopril and amlodipine for my BP.  I have been taking both of them for over 2 years and experienced some light headness plus several anxiety attacks.  I stopped taking the medicine when I developed swollen lips eyes and a rash.  My DR took me off the med immediately and I think my tolerance for this medication is now very low.  I would suggest everyone have their DR. go over the side effects of the meds they take periodically.  Lastly I was thinking I had a reaction to Mangoes when my lips swelled up but Dr. said he had seen patient in the past with this reaction from the medication,3
"The cough is like an uncontrollable spasm, much worse at night. Also my eyes water and am experiencing post-nasal drip. 6 days on this medication and above side effects are increasing, including impaired sleep due to chronic coughing. Will contact physician when daylight arrives!",4

"I started on the Lisinopril about about 5 months ago.  I knew one of the side effects would be coughing but it stated it should subside after the body become use to the meds.  Well 5 months later the cough was very light and now it has turned into a very harsh, strong and disruptive dry cough.  This cough causes others to have concern because of the severeness at times.  It disrupts my sleep every single night and can be painful to the stomach it is such a powerful type of cough.  I get no sleep with this med.  I will be seeking out another med because it is taking my pressure down but bringing it back up with the stress of not sleeping and all the coughing.",3
"I have a dry cough, sleepiness, headache and sleepiness.  Several times I have woking up at night to throw-up due to the coughing.  My pressure went down the first 3 weeks but is now back up again.  Cannot get in to see doctor until next week.",3
"Only problem I have experienced with Lisinopril is sensitivity to sun exposure and residing in Phoenix makes the problem worse. Skin tingles.Sun blockers do no good and I must wear white long sleeved shirts when outside, however, the drug has worked well so I don't want to change.",5

"It has lowered my BP but i have had the cough i cant get rid of. Thought it was a new problem i was having, never thought it was related til i read about it on here. It interfered with work meetings, and my sleep. Dr never meantioned it could be the drug. Glad the sight posted about it, i called my Dr and asked my med to be changed.",2
"Coughing and post nasal drip.  Does anyone know how long after you stop taking the drug, the coughing and dripping might stop or ease up?  I'm only off it for 4 days.",3
"This particular blood pressure medication is generic under my prescription plan, and it works just as well as the name brand, for me anyway.  My husband was on it also, but it made him cough, which could be one of the side-effects.  So my doctor put him on another brand.",5
My dr. prescribed me the 5mg Lisinopril for high blood pressure.  It did lower my blood pressure however I experience panic and worrying for no reason and I have been coughing severly to the point I can not catch my breath.  I emailed my doctor and she took me off of it right away.,3
"As advised by a licensed MD I took 5mg Amlodopine with 20mg Lisinopril within 1 hour I had severe muscle cramping, chest pain, could not walk without assistance. I immediately stopped taking this RX and spent the next 9 days recovering. In the mean time I had an episode where I could not talk nor form words. I was subsequently sent to my local hospital for a head CT /w contrast. COMPLETELY NORMAL. I know that it was the combination of those two meds!!!!! So, the side effects were very life threatening!!!",1
Was able to cut the dosage in half after one month. ,4
some what good,2
"I have been taking this medication for five years have not experienced any of the side effects that are posted.  I guess it is not for everyone, but for me it has been very effective at lowering my blood pressure.",5
I have been taking this for one year and have suffered no side effects and it has been completely effective in maintaining my blood pressure within healthy bounds.,5
I've been on this drug since last Dec. and in January started an annoying cough and post nasal drip to a point where I gag and almost throw up.  My doctor never told me it could be from this pill. I am changing doctors tomorrow.,3
"I have been taking for about a month.  I was extremely tired during the first few weeks, but my energy level seems to be back to norm. I also noticed itchy scalp at the beginning, which also seems to be ok now.  My main issue is complete numbness in my left arm and leg during the night. Hopefully it will go away soon. The pins and needle feeling is annoying and wakes me from my sleep.  ",3
Since taking this medicine I have become short of breath walking through house.  Was not having this problem before taking this drug.,3
"I has given me side effects such as, diarrhea and dry cough.",1
"I have been constantly sick with colds and cough on this product, taken off and all symtoms Gone.",5
Severe itching of the face & neck.  Random coughing. Stopped taking after about 2.5 weeks per Dr advice.,3
"Been on 10mg for approximately 6 months, have been hospitalized 5 times for anxiety attacks, have trouble breathing at times, feel like passing out constantly, always weak and feel terrible. My blood pressure DID go down, but side affects are NOT worth it. Very healthy 27yr old.",4
i have been on this drug for 2 mounths with no problems,4
"Lisinopril has worked for me for the last 5 years, but lately my BP has been elevated.",3
makes me dizzy ,4
"Drug has horrible side effects - if you feel weak, tired, anxious, nervous, panic attacks, I suspect its Lisinop especially from all the posts on this website.  I am stopping this med and hope to improve in a matter of days but I can find no other reason why I waking up feeling okay, take the medication and 2 to 3 hours later have high anxiety, nervousness and even panic attacks for no reason at all....  Not happy with drug, also lack of concentration and comprehension on this medication... ",1
dry heave,5
My blood pressure is still elevated after taking the drug for 5-7 days,2

"Apparently I had a reaction to this drug,",1

so far so good been 1 month on drug pressure has dropped to acceptable terms.,3
"This lowered my BP within 24 hours.  I was averaging 138/95 and now it is 120/80.  It seems to be lower within hours of taking the pill, and then raises a little 12 hours later.  No side effects so far after 7 days. ",5
Developed every side effect on the list and had pains in the stomach and side for months. Finally took myself off and still healing from the overall down effects.,3
I had an adverse reaction to the RX and was hospitalizezed fo r days.  My throat swelled closed.,3
"I have been taking Lisinopril/HCTZ, 20/25 mg, for about a year now. I have put up with the nonproductive cough for almost as long as I've been taking it. In the past few (6?) months, I have noticed  that my lips and tongue have been sore. I have changed toothpaste with no real change. For the past week my lips have been swollen and are now blistering. I thought it was from something I ate, but can think of nothing I have been allergic to in the past that could have bothered me. I'm thinking it is the Lisinopril. Does anyone have a similar experience? Please let me know",4
I really don't like the cough with this drug and its all day every day.,3
I experienced flu like aches and pains to my body the day after I took the medication. I didn't make the connection until I went in to see my doctor.,5
i am researching medications and how to look up information,1
Experiencing sweating and imbalancr,3
"I experienced the cough, hoarseness...The worst side effects are the EXTREME tiredness and BAD muscle aches!I have also had weight gain and bloating. I did not realize that these issues could be from this medication until I read the reviews. ",4
Itching and rash,3
keeps my bp low,5
"I have experienced some hoarseness. It has helped, but now I have experienced extreme tirednes almost from the day I started it.",4
"For the past 18 months, I have been taking Lisinopril 10 MG tab every night.  Shortly after using this medication (2 months or so), I developed itching in my scalp and began to loose my hair.  I am 73 years old male in excellent health and my hair never experienced such a detrimental condition. I am partially bald and I am worrying about this problem.  I also take Lipitor to control cholesterol, and Co Q-10 200 MG to suppress the muscle pain Lipitor has caused.   Please advice",4
"Immediately experienced lightheadedness. Became extremely tired and had to lay down for several hours. I stopped taking them and began feeling like my head would explode. My blood pressure went up to stroke levels. I began taking lisinopril again. My blood pressure went down but I began having a dry cough,exaustion, racing heart beat and panic attacks. What's worse, my throat became swollen and sore. Turning my head was difficult as a result of the swelling. Fearing that I may have cancer, I went to the emergency room; They were unmoved by my pain. I was told that it was more than likely, my lymph nodes and sent me on my way. I decided to check Web.MD and found that there were thousands of people who have had the same experience with this medication that I had! Some people can use this drug, I suppose, because some have sung it's praises. But if your first reaction to Lisinopril is not a good one. Call your Doctor!",4
Dry cough and muscle weakness. took poassium level test. Blood pressure are going down satisfactory level,3
My blood pressure was 170/90 in November. I have since had it checked four times in the last six months and it has come down to 120/80 & 110/70 which the Doctor is very happy with.,5
after 3 weeks blood pressure is climbing,1
I have been on this medication for 1 1/2 years it has worked great.Since my increase from 20 to 40 mg I pee alot more does this happened to anyone else,4
Higher blood pressure than previous medication. Anxiety.,1
"I do have leg aches ...but not sure , it might also be from the previsit i was also taking",4
I've been taking the lisinopril now for 2 months.  My heart palpitations are to a minimal finally!  I love this medication but the coughing and the horseness in my voice has become so annoying.  So I am now going to try micardis 40 mg once a day.  I just read the reviews on this drug and hope I dont experience the side effects other people have had.  I walk everday and have lost weight and feel great! I guess I will compare the two and if I have to put up with the cough instead of fatigue and back pain-then I may switch back.  ,4
This med has worked as good as any hb med I have taken,4
makes you lifeless,1
"Successfully reduced BP but after 7 months of 5 mg/day dosage, I developed severe vertigo and dizziness when getting out of bed in the AM, and general tiredness. Stopped taking medication on my own two days ago and vertigo/dizziness has disappeared. Contacted Dr who agreed with my decision and schedule appt in one month to review BP and possible lower dosage (2 1/2 mg) or another drug.  ",5
"I recently added lisinopril to my other meds, (Multaq and Diltiazem HCL ER), and I am having terrible muscle cramps all over my body.  Any body else have multiple muscle spasms with this drug?  Maybe it's the other drugs complicating things.",3
"The side effects are not quite as bad after getting use to the drug; blurred vision, fatigue and lightheadedness upon standing.  I would like to get off this drug.  But, am not sure if there are side effects to quitting.  However, I have found a cosmetic side effect.  Ladies if you hightlight your hair blond, have well water and night sweats, your hair will turn copper red.  I have to strip my hair every 3-4 weeks at the hairdresser.  This didn't start until being on the drug for about 4 to 5 months. My hair looks stained red just where it touchs the nape of my neck and ears.  Anyone else experience this?",4
I have been taking this med for 15 months.Did not have the cough problem. I have bad cramps in my legs while sound a sleep. I have been taking potassium for the cramps. Now I read that you should not take potassium with this med. Ant one having this condition.,4
"I've been taking this drug for three months (approximately) and have had no side effects that I am aware of. I am 81 years old, male, caucasion orn in Texas near Red River.",5
I have only been taking it 2 wks.  But it has changed my life.  My BP is finally normal and I can function again.  I have lost 11 lbs. and have no side effects other than the dizziness I experienced the first week.  I am surprised so many of you weren't aware of the possible cough.  That was the first thing my Dr. told me that a cough was a very common side effect.  I so far have not gotten one.,5
"Since I have been on it ,I have been able to maintain my blood pressure pills. It even works better since the have increased the dosage. My pills include the water pill.",4
"Changed to this RX for 9 days and coughed all the time, watery eyes, and couldn't sleep for more than 3 or 4 hrs due to cough. Also, had a metal taste in my mouth.  Stopped for one day, called the DR for a change and didn't cough much that day. ",1
"I have chronic coughting to point of vomiting. I thought it was my mild asthma. My new doc says this drug causes coughing and weight gain. Yes, I have that problem, too! After reading theses blogs, I will try something else. I am a phone operator and this coughing does not help with my job!",3
"Terrible side efects. Prescribed after a stroke. Why any doctor would precribe a drug that can cause anxiety, swelling of the throat and tongue, fatigue muscle aches and panic attacks I will never know. Husband wanted to die after a couple weeks of this drug - he is done taking it. Drug needs to be taken off the market.",3
"Chronic Cough , very annoying ! Found similar complaints here . Will stop med today and see doctor soon . I also feel tired and have some dizziness . ",2
"What a relief to read other comments about this medication on here today!  While it has been EXCELLENT at lowering my blood pressure quickly, I've been attributing all the other side effects to allergies including:  persistent cough, watery eyes, runny nose.  But there's also been serious diarrhea, tiredness and 'growling' stomach.  I'm going to as for a change next time I visit my doctor in a few weeks.  Thanks for all the objective reviews on here for the 'wake-up' call!!",5
"I started taking this mid-march. With early spring and allergies I thought my allergies were awful. After reading these reviews, I'm convinved the salty sinus drip and coughing is MED. related. I have no other allergy symptoms. Calling Dr in the a.m.",5

persistant cough,4
"40mg makes me fell dizzy, so the docton had me cut in half, all is ok now.",4
"I've taken this med for 7 years and recently have developed morning headaches out of the blue. Yesterday, my face and mouth swelled terribly and I ended up in the ER. The dr immediately told me i had angioedema. This can lead to an airway obstruction. Luckily, I decided to go seek medical assistance. I can no longer take lisinopril. Be aware that this too can happen to you. Today, I am on steroids, benadryl, and pepcid. I feel fine overall just be aware that if you suddenly swell in the throat, face, lips, or tongue that you could be in big trouble. This also explains a big scare 6 months ago when out of the country and my throat swelled 5x its size both inside and out. Know the risks and act immediately. It could save your life. I was told by the DR that you can take lisinopril for years w/o any side affects then all of a sudden it turns on you.",4
"I ahve been taking this med for several months and almost immediatley develped a throat tickle, coughing,and tearing.I am going to ask doc to change to something else.",5
"I have been taking this medication for 4 months now... bp is down, but the coughing,gagging, tearing of eyes is terrible.  Asking my dr to PLEASE put me on something else!",4

I have been taking this med for 6 mos. and it has lowered my BP however the dry tickling in my chest causes frequent coughing and I have dry mouth..I was never informed of these side effects..going to call my Dr to switch me to something else ,4
This medication did lower my Blood Pressure and ofcourse taking a small pill is easy.  But the side effects very unpleasant ~ severely tired while taking; excessive dry cough throughout the day and wakes during my sleep.  Not a happy camper here!,3

I have been taking this drug for 4 years. I see alot of people are having some of the symtems that I am having. Throat tickling and my Creatinine has risen from 1.4 to 1.8.I also havy dizzy spells when I get up fast. I take it in combination with Amlodipine Besylate because Lysinopril alone did not work well.My pressure runs between 120 and 130,3
made b/p very low,3
"Was quite satisfied at first -- BP down, no serious side effects UNTIL I developed the dry, tickling cough which is pretty much 24/7!  The coughing doesn't stop the tickle, which can rapidly progress to uncontrollable coughs, gagging & tearing eyes.  The ONLY thing that helps is a constant ingestion of menthol cough drops along with a CARBONATED drink.  Water or non-carbonated drinks don't stop the tickle, but the bubbles seem to ""scratch it""! I'll be seeking another medication, as this side effect is REALLY annoying & embarrassing.",3
keeps my blood pressure at a good rate,4
"Very fatigued, very tired",3
Medication is causing my creainine to go up gradually. started with 1.0 five years ago and now it's 1.5. What is the laternative to control my BP without damaging my kidney,2

This med controlled by blood pressure well however caused a dry tickling cough almost immediately. I thought it allergies but found this a side effect. My dr. has changed me to another bp med that is not causing the cough however I am still coughing periodically and hoping it will resolve completely soon.,3
 doesnt bring the b.p. down. takes a long time to work.,2
Does this medication have the effects of a water pill?,5
"The very first time I took this drug within 2 hours I felt faint, light headed, like I was to weak to stand without holding on to something. Began to pour sweat, my hair and shirt was soaken wet with sweat running down my arms. I was sent home from work. Could not get in to see my PCP even though I told his nurse it was an emergency so I sat in my recliner for around 4 hours before it passed.",1
"It cause me coughing,hard to breath and cut off my voice when trying to talk very much stress and chocking from coughing all day and night.give me headaches.It not a good medication to me.If I keep taking it I believe I will end up with serious health condition from this medication.  ",3

"Medication seems to be controlling my BP but I began a cough right away which I attributed to allergy season.My PCP told me to take OTC allergy meds,but the coughing never stopped.Spouse found the coughing to be a side effect on this web site (my PCP didn't mention this side effect).Stopped the med yesterday & am hoping the cough & tickling in throat go away soon (I talk on the phone all day for work so this has definitely impacted my job performance).",4
"I've been taking this drug for years in combination with other meds. for my very labile hypertension. For some reason the other day I had a reaction which caused a life threatening episode. My tongue swelled it's called ANGIOEDEMA(also my feet were itching like crazy).I wound up in the emergency room and every medical personnel asked me if I was taking Lisinopril.I was told even though I had never had a reaction it can happen at anytime and that my recent prescription (2 days before) for prilosec was not the cause. In any case, as far as I'm concerned Lisinopril is a very dangerous medication. None of the pharmacy information lists this side effect.It is just listed with many other meds. that MAY require additional monitering. I think angioedema should be listed as a definite side effect.",3
"i've been having swelling of my face,lightheadedness/dry cough",3
"I had a chronic cough that would not go away.  My doctor said Lisinopril is notorious for cough producing, so he took me off it and put me on another drug.  The cough has gone away.",3
I have been on this since Oct 2009 when I went to the hospital my BP was 220/124 so at first everything was fine I now have a horrible dry cough/tickle in my throat. It is bad because I also have a bad back with a buldging disc so the coughing hurts. It does not stay but when I do get the cough I cannot sleep wake up all night May have to try something else although it has worked for my blood pressure.,4
"Was on Toprol for years then my BP jumped up.  Switch to Lisinopril and am now dealing with cough, hoarse voice and racing heart beat. BP still stayed the same (high).  Only on meds for 5 days appx.  Called Doctor and will see about switching to something else.  Just wonder why Toprol stopped working.  Had no issues with those meds at all!",1
10MG A day. I have had a cough and itchy throat. Have been taking this for a year now and suddenly I have had swollen feet and hands with severe pain. Have stopped completely taking it and have appt in two days. ,3
It has been wonderful,5
Major side effect of the use is dry cough which usually relived by drinking water. In summer it appears tobe more frequent,5
minor eye puffiness,5
seems to be working,5
"Took Lisinopril for a year or so and just totally suffered on and off.  Dizziness, can't walk well without holding on to something, severe coughing and blurred vision that is only suppose to be temporary.   Two doctors failed to acknowledge that it was the medicine so I decided to make the decision to quit taking it after searching for better results on other medicines.  Most people seem to think Cozaar works well with very little side effects for some.  I've been on it for a week and the severe dizziness is going away and I feel so happy and relieved.   But I get a slight achy feeling in my knees/joints which I can tolerate if that is one of the side effects and some people are experiencing this problem as I see in the reviews on here.  I can handle it as long as that feeling is going to be very mild and it beats the heck out of not being able to walk well and feeling so lousy every single day because your so dizzy.  Not sure if everyone has this problem but when I first take a new BP medicine and too high of a dose, my BP will actually go up for a few weeks.  I had it go up so high, I think the strokes I had was from the medicine and too high of a dose.  The doctor in the ER mentioned that this can happen.  They never found out that I had 8 strokes until weeks or a month later after an MRI.  The neroulogist showed me the scan.  I swear a volunteer doctor I had gave me too high of a dose and that is what happened.  Luckily I got better but it took almost a year, lots of exercise, very low salt, small portions of food and plenty of water to get better.  ",2
"I've been to the doctor five time, trying to figure out why I have a itchy rash all over, it's the Lisinopril.",3
"i use lisinopril to prevent nephropathi as i am diabetic,, still now no renal signs or symptoms, i am 62 years old, i am happy with this drug",4
i haven't been as shaking or nervous as i was with other diabetes med...it easy to take.,4
Well I have been on Lisinopril 10mg all of 2 days my chronic and continual cough is even worse then befor but worse of all my heart rate has gone sky high I have had Tackacardia for 2 days I stopped taking Lisinopril for now and have gone back to Atenolol 100mgX2 until my Dr’s appointment next week this pill is not for me.,2
i have been talking lisinopril for 2 weeks now. i have been dizzy all day and now i have ED. my Dr. or the pharmacist never told me that this drug will cause ED. i am done with this med and calling Dr. to put me on a different drug.,4
i have been taking this medicine for 4 to 6 weeks at first was at 10 mgs dog upped the dose to 20 mgs. Now i am getting this dry cough through out the day and i wake up with the dry cough at night.  I see my doc for a BP check in 2 days.  I want something that dont make me cough.,4
I question if this 40mg.medication will cause weight gain.It keeps my blood pressure good..but I have experienced weight gain in the last 2 months I have taken the 40mg.,4
It is causing severe diarrhea. ,5

"I coughed night and day with this medication. The nurse told me ""this time of year is bad for allergies, don't give up yet. I KNEW it was not allergies, so finally I got another prescription and the coughing stopped. However, I took Hyzaar, and had severe dry mouth, and lost two teeth. I have yet to find a BP medication that I can take. I am now on a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. Don't know if I spelled that right, but I sure hope it helps. I hate prescriptions!",1
I have been on this now for two weeks and it is super effective in bringing down my BP. It's gone from 155/60 over 88/94 to 111/122 over 73/80 in this short time. So far the only side effect (minimal) is an occasional hacky dry cough. The MD has suggested I keep on lisinopril for another 3 months.,5

GP has decided it could be the Lisinopril, which I have now stopped taking for one week. Can anyone tell me when the cough is likely to stop. Am still coughing all the time. Very embarassing, especially in the dentist last week.",4
"started on 10mg one full week ago, seems like it has lowered the systolic but still having issues with the diastolic being elevated. Also extremely tired so much so that I started taking at night about an hr before bed. That helps but still have tiredness throughout the day but it is more manageable now. Still not really sure about this as it has only been a week.",4
"Started experiencing severe pain down both legs from the hips to the Toes. Very Severe, as bad as a quicky toothache constantly day and night.",1
"The first month or so was fine but now my hair has changed texture and has fallen out dramatically.  I thought it may have been related to stress, however, now I have severe dry lips, dry throat, and a constant thirst.  I have discontinued this drug.",3

My husband was on this drug for his  heart and he complained of his legs hurting so very bad. The doctors never realized this drug was causing his legs to hurt. Neither did I untill after his death I started to take it. I think someone should alert people taking the drug to be aware of the cough and the legs hurting.And nothing helped the cough I had. My husband suffered for over 2 years and no doctor ever came up with why his legs hurt or the cough (They thought the coughing was due to smoking(I do not smoke) and thought the legs hurt because of bypass surgery. They were so wrong.,2

Helped to control hbp, but cough and vomiting too much to handle. Dr switched me to Diovan and no side effects;although doesn't control as well.

allergic reaction,1
I have tried many different BP meds. Most meds have side effects. I have switched back to Lisinopril because the other meds had worse side effects. I take it at night and have no allergic reactions. Try splitting your dose or taking it at bedtime. Takes a good 2 weeks for your body to adjust. ,5
"Was on Prinival 10 MG (Merck) but have tried 3 times over the last 3 years to use the generic Lisinopril (TEVA) to save money.  Each time, no matter what the duration, constant chest fluttering and  even higher BP were experienced.  Keep being told no difference between generic & brand name, but I believe there is something in the filler/binder the manufacturer (TEVA) uses since I am on 2 other medications from the same manufacturer (TEVA) and also have side effects, but the side effect is tolerable.  When switched back to Prinivil, everything is fine so I'm staying with Prinivil.",1
"Dr. started me on 10 mgs, worked well, but not quite good enough, he raised it to 40 mgs.  I never felt so bad in my life! But I'm stubborn and besides I didn't want to have meds changed again.  So I hung in, read hundreds of reviews on this website.  Then I found a few that said the same thing was happening to them when their prescription was raised to 40 mgs. These few reviews each said they divided the 40 mgs into two 20mgs doses, one taken in am, the other in pm.  I tried, it worked!! Don't give up, this medication is the only one that works on my bp.  The dry cough lasted about 3 wks, the flu feelings left, too, once I divided the dosage.  ",5
caused coughing.,2
Been taking nearly 2 months. about the same time I started having a persistant cough that just wouldn't go away. Just thought it to be a cold and disregarded until I heard from NP that it was a side effect of this drug. I have requested that it be changed,3
"I have been taking lisinopril for over a month now.  When I first started taking this I came to web md to read the reviews on this, so I would have an idea about any side affects.  A week after I started taking this drug I experience a cough, sinus drainage, and sore throat.  I also experience a little insomia.  This went on for about 2 weeks, so I started drinking a lot of water with this medicine.  Not sure if this is what helped me but since I drink plenty of water with it I haven't had any of these problems.  This may not work for everyone but it's worth a try.",4
"Been on this for about 2yrs and only issue is ""head rush"" type feeling sometimes when standing. works great on bp!! went from 130's/90ish to 108/66. (to low?) i race bicycles and have not had any issues with that.",5
"I am currently having palpitations with this and decided to remove myself from it, regardless of the outcome.  ",1
"I was prescribed the generic version of Lisinopril for HBP. I took it for several months, never knowing the persistant, urgent cough could possibly be a side effect. I had just ordered another 3 month supply, when I found this site where everyone confirmed to me that the cough came from this medicine! The dr. permenantly took me off it, and replaced it with Micartis--expensive, but effective without that annoying cough! He says they're working on a generic.",3
i have used linsinopril for several years and have never experienced acuard efects. together with other meds my b.p. is under control,3
I was on this drug for 8 years with very good results.  But it ended up lower my blood count so my doctor is now having me try other drugs.  none as effective,5
"I have been on Lisinopril 10 mgs for a week because my blood pressure was high even though I was taking attenenol.  I take them both before going to bed, sleep well except I've noticed a cough that wakes me up and I have to drink water.  My palpitations that I have had for months are almost gone, which is a plus!  I'd rather have the cough than the palps. I feel more fatigued and headachey but hopefully these symptons will go away once I get used to this drug. ",3
I was one of the few that had an allergic reaction to it.  Glad to be off it and in the end it has significantly raised my blood pressure.,1

Lot of sinus congestion & a cough, but then, I had that before the med too.  Maybe it's time for a change to something that will help w/lower number too...  Who knows, maybe the cough and congestion will get better tooo.....",4

"COULD NOT STOP COUGHING FOR MONTHS!!!!! It was because of this lousy drug! Take my advice, Don't or stop taking this drug.",1
"I've always used a generic brand of this drug, and I was having a lot of problems  until I switched pharmacies.  The new pharmacy dispensed this drug manufactured by Watson, which was much more effective, and all of my old side effects disappeared.  All generics are not safe or equal.",5

"I have been on this drug (10mg) for about two 1/2 weeks.  I have had this dry scratchy cough, and feeling the need to clear my throat often especially during the night.  I did not realize it could be a side effect until I saw all the people doing reviews talking about the same type of cough.  The first week I felt queasy, foggy.  I have noticed some additional blurring of vision, but not sure if that is due to the drug. It has lowered my blood pressure a bit.",4
terrible cough,4
"I took this for 2 years, then suddenly developed a cough that lasted for 3 months and started breaking out in hives.  Dr. switched me to Diovan - cough and hives both stopped.  It did control my blood pressure very well, but the cough was too much. ",3
"From the very beginning I did not feel good on this medication.  At first it lowered my Blood Pressure to a normal range.  (One day)However, in two days I had an awful upper respiratory infection and cold.  Came out of nowhere!!! It did not go away until I stopped the medication. I even cut the med in half thinking it would help.  Just kept the infection going.   I am not on another pull  (Exforge) and we will see how it goes..",1
"After 2 weeks of use, my vision became blurry. I was dizzy and listless. I felt unable to function well. I felt nauseous with stomach pain.  Needless to say, I stopped taking Lisinopril 20mg altogether.  ",1

"I loved the way I felt while taking this drug, but I had the nagging cough! I didn't have the cramps and sweating I have with Benicar though.I wish I could take this med. Does the cough eventually go away? I'd almost take the cough over the constant headaches and sweating. Does great for my BP! The lowest ever.",5
"Nasty smoker's cough to the point of a deep dry heave. I guess the more affordable the medication the more misery you must go through. While this medication may work the miserable chronic cough it produces makes this product unacceptable and with so many other options out there it surprises me doctors push this one for there patients. Maybe they need to be required to try these medications before prescribing them so they will learn first hand how horrible the cost of benefits penality is taking these blood pressure medications. Avoid Lisinopril- again it may work but when coughing your head off regularly day after day it gets old fast. Too- getting dirty looks in public by women with children that you are a sick puppy and belong indoors and not outdoors thinking you may be making there children become sick since you appear so. A coughing mouth mask should come with this product upon purchase. Sincerely, W.S.",4

Symptoms of uncontollable dry cough showed up after I had a bout of bronchitis, and got progressively worse each day.  I finally went back to my Dr thinking I still had bronchitis, but was diagnosed as simply having allergic reaction to the drug, so she had me taking allergy pills to alleviate symptoms.  I had to swtich back to Diovan. ",4
I have just used this medicine for a few days so it isn't fair to say that I'm satisfied or not satisfied.,3
"I had stage 2 hypertension, 10mg of lisinopril daily has brought that down to 120/80.  Before trying lisiniopril I was on a vasodialator and experienced some of the symptoms reported here by other people on lisinopril, ie:dry cough, migrain, body ache.  Initially on lisinopril I was dizzy.  Dizzyness wore off after 10 days.  Overall, very pleased with the product, no lasting side effects.",5
"Since I started taking this drug, I started having a dry cough. My throat will become very itchy and I will start coughing. It is very annoying especially at work and while I'm sleeping. ",3
allowed me to reduce my tenormin dosage and my blood pressure is consistently 125/85 or less,5
This lowers my blood pressure but after taking it for 6 months with coreg i started having extreme reactions to the coreg so my doctor put me on the lisinopril twice daily.  Now i've developed that cough that everyone is talking about.  It is very annoying and wakes me from my sleep.  I'm thinking of lowering my dose again and see if it goes away.,4

"I'm a 44 yr old male and was prescribed Lisonipril for high blood psi prevention. I do not have high BP currently. The first month I developed what I thought was a cold. Headache, bad cough,weezing lots of mucus. It was bad enough to get anti biotics from my doctor. The cold symtoms never got better, I saw a allergist and had all test done for every allergy. He gave me a breathing machine to take home as my lungs were full and I could not breath correctly. Night time was the worst, coughing started once I layed down, sometimes choking on the mucus. I noticed my sex drive was way down, I have always had a very healthy sex drive and this was distressing. I was always tired, depressed, irritable. My hair began to get dried out and dead feeling, I thought it was my shampoo or something. My mouth was so dry I began carrying a water bottle around with me. I have rashes on both legs that itch severely. I remember saying to my wife, I feel really sick, like all around bad. Something is wrong. I never get colds, I have perfect numbers cholest is 166. I know when something is wrong. I ran out of pills before the weekend and did not take any for 4 days. I began to feel less sick and could breath. I took my first pill in the 4 days and that night was feeling ill again. I looked up side effects that night and was shocked. I trusted my doctor, never thought this little pill was responsible for all this pain. 3 months of lost productivity. It been just one day off the pills, I can only hope I return to normal.",1
"Shortly after initiating treatment with this drug, I developed the ""chronic dry cough"" everyone talks about.  It has somewhat lessened over time but is still there.  After taking 10mg/day (doc had actually prescribed 40 mg!) for 5 months I developed Interstitial Cystitis (painful bladder disease) due to bladder irritation from the drug.  This is extremely painful and hard to resolve.  I would not recommend this drug for anyone having previous bladder sensitivity problems.        At the same time of being diagnosed with hypertension, I was also found to be hypothyroid.  The thyroid medication has brought down the B.P. to a much greater degree than the lisinopril.        My recommendation to anyone with high blood pressure or high cholesterol - rule out thyroid problems first before taking medications that may result in adverse side effects!!     ",4

Currently I take it about every other night.  I take it at night so when my bp is below 90/60 I'm asleep and it doesn't matter.  I have trouble functioning when it drops below this.  Had colonoscopy and my blood pressure went dangerously low.  If someone is having problems I recommend they double check with doctor before taking dose when anesthesia will be involved.

"I do get dizzy when standing up to fast and for no reason at all for 1sec, but it has helped me with my blood pressure, went from 140/90 to 120/75, or 130/80, I've seen it as low as 111/62, if it works don't fix it, Now that I'am reading more on this drug I see people have  sleeping trouble,, so do i ?????? 10mg per day.",3
"Within the first 3 weeks I did get an annoying cough and dizzy several times, I stuck it out and that went away and this medication has been very effective in lowering my blood pressure",4
"I've been taking Lisinopril HCI (diuretic) for approx 2 yrs and while it has brought my BP down I believe that symptoms I've had are associated with this drug.  Very bad raspy to lose voice, severe stomach pain, bloating, and gas, initial dizziness that went away, and congestion/lots of phlegm.  Used to take 1st thing in AM & switched to before bed. This drug helped drop my BP but lots of issues with it.  Will see doc to soon to change med. Otherwise healthy person that now has severe gastro issues, creeping up potassium levels, cholesterol and sugar after taking Lisinopril HCI. These were gradual issues that appeared over time and it has taken a lot of discomfort and detective work to identify this drug is most likely the problem. ",4
No side effects thus far.,4
I have asthma and the side effects of coughing just aggravates the breathing problems I have,5
"this drug has been effective in lowering my blood pressure and I only had some side effect issues the first couple of days, 3rd week and I'm side affect free. I take it in the AM with food, the label says with or without food but I feel like crap if I take it on an empty stomach.",4
I was diagnosed with Prehypertensive BP it was always 149/92. I am only 31 years old but an african-american female. So far so good for me. I never did attribute all of the new joint aches and pains that I have with this medicine as I only take 10mg with HCTZ 25mg but I am starting to realize that is what maybe causing all of this for me. I am still in denial that I will have to take something for the rest of my life in order to keep it under control so I will be losing weight of which I have already done and eating better. I can't stand to have to be on medication and I am an nurse. My BP now runs in the low 118/75. My BP use to be in the 100/70 range. ,5

"Taken this medication ,10mg twice a day, for one year and the whole year, had a cough, watery eyes,very tired,and dry mouth. Did not know what was causing this until went to doctor and told him what I was experiencing. Was taken off and put on Diovan. Will never take Lisinopril again.",2
"I have well-controlled myasthenia gravis and I am taking Lisinopril, Norvasc, and Diovan to control my blood pressure. I would like to know if these drugs are safe with MG.  I lost a son about 4 years ago and my husband has been a Hospice patient since March 06, 2009.  I am sole care giver.  I recently felt like I was losing my mind or having a breakdown, so my doctor put me on Zoloft 75mg daily.  It has certainly taken the edge off but I am horrified of it!  I have been told that withdrawing from it is a living nightmare!  It seems to agree with the MG, but I would really, really like to know if ALL of these meds are safe with MG.  Thank you.",3
"My new doctor started me on this from day 1 after being diagnosed with very mild kidney disease and the only problem I've encountered was low blood pressure, which hasn't been much of an issue.  The drug has been doing its job and my doctors are very pleased with the results from such a short time on it.",4
I have a question - are there foods that interact with Lisinopril?,4
"AT 10mg EXPERIENCED ONLY SLIGHT COUGH WITH BLOOD PRESSURE COMING DOWN ONLY SLIGHTLY.  ASKED PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO GO TO 20mg.  BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN, NO LONGER IN STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION.

"I have been taking this drug for many years. I have never associated any of the sleep, cough, or allergy problems others report, even though some of my previous reactions could have been as a result of this drug. However, I also take atenolol. Dr is going to take me off the beta blocker, and up the dosage of this drug. Not sure what the result will be, but i will report back if there are any adverse effects. The atenolol did cause me to lose taste for a time, but it eventually came back. I do have to urinate quite often, but don't know if it is related to this drug.",4
caused me kidney problems had to stop immediately,1
"I don't know why I've been prescribed this medication. Yes, I'm diabetic (type 2), but my blood pressure is fine. Every time I've tested my blood sugar, it's well within range. (I'm on actos).   I've been taking this medication for 5 days and experience nausea with some vision problems. I currently take 8 pill medications per day (including lisinopril and aspirin) and two eye-drop medications per day. I feel like I'm being medicated to death. At what point are all the medications more than enough? What can I do to prevent what I believe is over-medication. ",3
"After taking this for several years I started having a lot of trouble sleeping and my BP would drop to 105/68 and I would get cold very easy.  I did not associate the sleep problem to this drug.  I ask my Dr to change it because I was tired of freezing all winter.  Suprise, my sleep problem is gone.  Other than that I found it effective.",4
"nuisance cough that woke me at night, caused choking when eatting, caused kidney disease.",3
"One 20mg pill every day has brought my BP down from 140/90 to around 116/75. I experienced a slight lightheaded feeling the first day or two of use, but since then I have noticed no side effects at all.",5

This drug has controlled my HTN and lower my BP to within normal ranges.,4
"This medication has improved my blood pressure, but I'm mostly still in the pre-hypertension range.  The main problem with it is that I have terrible fits of cough--mostly at night. I now have to sleep with candy in my mouth in order to be able to sleep.  My doctor will switch me to a different medication due to the side effects.",3
Lisinopril 2.5 mg. worked for lowering my blood pressure but had to change medications to amlodipine 2.5 mg. because the dry cough kept me up some nights. Lets hope the amlodipine works.,5
"This medication has brought my BP down from a dangerous to a healthy level in days.  I take it before bed, so drowsiness is not an issue, it actually helps me sleep.  One side affect I do not like is the tickly throught constant cough.  However, if it saves my life, I would rather have a cough!  (I have helped that with hot green teas.)  ",5
"It seems to be working, although recently I have developed a dry cough,I am assuming that I may be developing a reaction to this?",2
Ive taken it for three weeks along with exercise and diet and no help so far,1
joint pain,1
"I will have to tell you the effectiveness of this medication work great.  It brought down my BP 158/116 to 148/90 within an hour after taking the meds. However, the side effects are bad. Major shortness of breath, dizzyness.  I would walk about 5 steps, then run out of air.  Couldn't sleep well with it.",5
"Horrific side effects.  Chest and stomach pain.  Severe, debilitating headache.  Right arm numbness.  Knee joint aches.  Do not, I repeat, do not take this medication.  It has taken me three weeks to begin to feel better.  Even so, I still have severe headaches.  ",1
"Took me off atenolol and put me on this, now I am light headed, nausea, loosing sleep, dry throat, loss of vision, blood glucose is very high.",1
Very effective. Has my blood pressure under control.,5
I think this drug was not a good thing to take with potassium. It caused my blood pressure to go very high as I had to change Drs and the second insisted I take potassium.,5
experiencing vertigo,3
"My husband has been on this med for a long time. He has complained of watery eyes, sinus problems, cough, but we attributed it to his COPD. It did help his HBP, but just had a very scary reaction: a dangerously swollen tongue. Rushed to ER, they got him immediately. The first thing the dr. asked was: are you on Lisinopril? Yes. They have seen this reaction many times before from people who have taken it for a long time, and even after they have quit. He was admitted to Critical Care Unit overnight.  Very jarring experience as he's never had ANYTHING like that before. The med has been discontinued and he will need to get another one to help the diltiazen keep the BP down. Not a good experience!!!",4
"have been taking 20 mgs.for about one year.lowered bp somewhatbut have had a dry cough,tired all of the time going to the bathroom often,trouble sleeping at night.decreased sexual desire.I ran out of medication and could not get refill right away.Dry cough gone ,sleeping better now.don't feel as tired and renewed sexual desire is back.I am not going to take this medicine again.The hell with this medication.",1

"It has given me,headache and constant dry cough. I am experience irrelevant thoughts.",1
"I have noticed an increase of confusing dreams, some leave me very pissed off. I havnt had the terible bad cough that most have refered to, but have not felt the same either. At this point I can't afford to take anything else. Money is the problem, and I have ran out of that too. Maybe I'd be better not taking anything.",3
I am an 89 year old male...I seem to be loosing my voice since I began taking this medication.  At first I thought it was my thyroid (synthroid) medicine that was causing this because it has in the past but when I increased the thyroid medicine I still kept loosing my voice.  I quit taking the lisinopril and my voice became strong again and not shaky...I began again and there went my voice.  Have any of you had similar problems?,3
Have the dry cough and some light dizziness.  Blood pressure has been better.,4
"have a chronic cough, why?",3
"I was given this medication because my insurance wouldn't pre-certify another drug.  I have been on it for 2 months and find the dry cough to be totally intolerable.  I can't sleep at night, can't carry on conversations--in short, I can't function.  Finally got a new prescription today.  Yay!!",2
I went on this medication after having major side effects with another med. I will gladly take a dry cough over high blood pressure any time. I feel great and have more energy than ever!,5
This medication makes me sleepy and upsets my stomach.,1
After taking this medication for six days(1 pill per day) I passed out while driving my car and had a serious automobile accident. Fortunately neither my wife or I was seriously injured. The car was a total wreck.I was taken to the hospital in the ambulance and admitted. After extensive tests it was determined that the Lisinopril was the reason for the blackout. I am n ow on a different medicine.,1

"After 1 week of use face and eyes became swollen with itcy rash. Went off and took about 5 days for rash to go away. Thinking allergic reaction may have been from something else, tried again and after two pills, eyelids swelled and itcy rash on face. Will not continue using",2

"I was put Lisinopril for blood pressure.About 2 weeks after taking Lisinopril I began to have head aches, tired all the time, VERY bad cough day and night. My feet began to swell and all my joints became swollen. I felt like I had the flu. Also, I had to get up during the night 4-5 times to urinate.  ",2
"I have been on this for about 3 1/2 years. I have had dizzy spells, usually after a long drive and getting out of the car. I almost fell over once and I am in good physical shape.

Iam Coughing all the time,4
Horrible cough that I have no longer since I quit this drug a week ago. I am not sure if long term or permanent damage to my throat has occurred yet. I feel so much better. I beleive I had a allergic reaction due to the swelling in my throat. Have told Dr. but said to keep taking it. Said it was a side effect. Found out it is a allergic reaction instead. If you have any symptoms stop taking it. I was put on losartan instead so far so good.,1

Keeps my heart rate at an acceptable rate.,4
I just started on this medication for 3 days now. MY BP has come down some but not low enough yet to be as effective as I would like yet.  I take it with another BP medication.  Does anyone take it with another medication or taken alone.  ,2
"COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY I HAD THIS DRY COUGH. COUGHING TO THE POINT OF VOMITING. I HAVE BEEN READY TO SEE AN ENT. NOW I KNOW IT'S THE MEDICATION. I WILL SEE MY DOCTOR AND TRY ANOTHER MEDICATION. I NEED SOME SLEEP, THE COUGH HAS ME UP ALL NIGHT!",1

After being on this medication for one year I noticed that my sense of taste has disappeared. I will certainly ask my Doctor for something else.,3
"I was prescribed this med after not being able to take statins. Insurance co. instructed dr to prescribe this for high blood pressure, the thing is i don;t have high blood pressure, so why take this?",1

"weak feeling,dizzy",1
After many drugs many years a normal pressure 118/68 cough cough cough tired tired tired.,5
"I gave this drug a one star for effectivenss and ease of use not because it wasn't easy to swallow the pill or because it didn't lower my blood pressure.  I would have liked to give a no star for satisfaction however.  I developed all the side effects after several months until I truly felt I would rather die of a heart attack than feel the way I felt on this drug.  I quit taking it on my own.  I feel a little better, but if my vision problems that developed because of it don't soon reverse, I will be extremely unhappy, more than I am now. ",1
"I took this medication for 2 months and saw very little change in my blood pressure; however, my pulse ratee increased.  Within a week of beginning this med, I started experiencing difficulties: A frequent dry cough;  I lost my sense of taste; decreased appetite (lost 17 lbs in 2 months; my mouth was extremly dry, especially at night, and I just felt plain sick for 2 months; very tired.

have had a problem with coughing,5
I have heart disease and am on metropolol plus statins.  I have had good success with Lisinopril.  The cough others have indicated was also a problem but I stuck with the meds and the cough is now gone after about 3-4 months with it.  I have leg cramps also but have had them for years.  the secret to dealing with them is to keep my legs and feet very warm at night. My blood pressure is never higher than 120/80 and my heart rate is about 62.  Previously my resting heart rate was 102. If you can stick with the meds thru the first six months I think some of the side effects will lessen.,5
i beieve it has worked for me i feel find i wonder if it can cause a cough,5
It seems that about and hour after taking I begin to become very tired and it lasts for most of the day.,5
"my dad was taking this medication for about 10months without any major change in his BP. then one night, his top lip started swelling non-stop.  after being admitted to the hospital, we were told he had an allergic reaction to this drug (which is a side affect).  his lips and face stayed swollen for 4dys.

"I was doing a routine check up when my blood pressure was discovered to be 156/86. The doctor rechecked my pressure with me standing and found it to be lower but not great. He briefed me on this drug with its' possible side effects and sent me off to walmart to get started. My BP fell to 120/75 as soon as I checked it following ingesting the pill. I have only been on this drug for a few days and it is doing what it is supposed to for me, I am going to monitor it for any signs of breathing difficulties.",5

Sucked on cough drops but did not help.  My throat has been sore for a month and now I know  now that all of this is from this terrible drug.  Thanks to all of you reviewers who took the time to write about your experience so it could help the rest of us!",1
I just started taking it and do not know how effective it will be for me.,2

Exhaustion, headaches, chills, sweats, loss of appetite, and feeling like my head is not screwed on straight. Dr. switched me to another med but if side effects make you too tired to exercise and take care of yourself what are we gaining ? ...very frustrating- but hoping to find a balance",4
Oh my god ! i have been gagging late at night and sinus drainage real bad and muscle cramps and it was the medicine. I'm still on medicine but no more side effects for now.

This is the third medicine that my doctor has tried on me for my blood pressure.  It works at lowering my bp but the fatigue and tiredness is intolerable.  I also can't sleep at night.  One thing which I haven't gotten is the cough.  I am going to see my doctor for the insomnia which has been horrible for me.  ,3

I developed a horrible cough soon after starting this medication but didn't realize the medication was the cause until I stopped taking it about 6 weeks later.I went to the doctor about the cough and that was what we determined the cause to be.,1

"Had been taking this drug about 2 months and developed a cough almost immediately.  Generally when I lay down to sleep the cough begins and persists for almost an hour.  Thought the cough was related to a cold I had just gotten over until I realized other people on this drug had the cough.  Also, started getting occasional ringing in my ears which now is almost non-stop.  Took myself off the med 3 days ago and will be seeing my dr next week, AND an ENT for the hearing.  45 yr old male.",4
"I am a 25 yo male. I had blood pressure at around 160/80's. The doctor put me on 10mg of lisinopril, it brought my BP down to 150/75, but brought my erectile ability to about 90% of what it normally is (still okay). Doctor increased to 20mg and then 40mg. At 20mg and 40mg (no difference between the two), my BP was around 135/75 and but my erectile ability dropped to about 40%...which is not okay. I am a personal trainer, and am only 25...too young to be dealing with impotence. Changed to cozaar, which lowers bp about 10 points and adds to sexual ability.",4
i feel that this medication is affecting my sexual performance,4
I have not had a problem with this drug since 1999.  That is when I started taking Lisinopril for HBP.,5
"Started at 5mg, then 10, then 20, then 40 (2 20s) and my BP improved but was underwhelming (middle 80s over middle 130s).  Then the doctor added 12.5 mg of a diuretic once a day, then 12.5 twice a day and still no change (except for more frequent bathroom trips).  I am not impressed with Lisinopril at all but it worked for my Dr.'s wife so he likes it.  If I am taking meds for hypertension, especially 2 meds twice a day I don't want just improved BP, I want GOOD BP.  I don't know what the change will be next month.",3

"My BP was not too high, but Dr put me on 10mg/day. It lowered BP some. Developed a bad cough, some occasional chest pain.

I am not passing out in the mornings,4
"ive taken a very low dose of this drug for the past year. 2.5 mg never had high bp but had a cardiac stent placed last nov. i cant really tell you when but i gradually developed a horrible cough. it starts now bout 5mins after i lay down and im up all night. dont know if im up because of the cough or the insomnia is a separate side effect. i was having sore throat as welland went to what turned out to be 2 entd.. the first telling me it was allergies and acid reflux the second telling me it may be a side effect of this particular medication. i then decided to look it up on this website and saw that several people had similar side effects. i would rate this drug as goo effective and useful, however i never had high bp to begin with so who knows however, this is a quality of life issue and the cough is absolutely horrible it also keeps my wife up as well i would suggest u speak to your cardiologist asap if u develop any of these side effects.. im discontinuing today. Also sneezing and sneezing in fits sometimes uncontrollable is another issue",5
"I took the med for 4 or 5 years and it worked very well.  I took it with another hi BP med and it was fine.  On day I woke up, took my meds and in an hour I could not get the energy to get off of the couch.  My BP was 86/40.  After a couple more days of this, I finally stopped the med.  It was working too well with the other med and I was unable to function with that low BP.  I would say the med worked well but not to mix it with another without good follow up.",5
"I went to the doctor for an unrelated check, and discovered my blood pressure was high(154/90). The doctor prescibed this medication.I have been on it for 1 week and my B.P. has climbed steadily till today it was 168/112. I am discontinuing use till I see the doctor again in 2 days.",1
"I have been on this drug 7 years.  Dr switched it from expensive Diovan.  Right away the coughing started...all day and ESPECIALLY as soon as I lay down at night, non-stop.  5 minutues after I am in bed I cant breathe and I stay all stuffed up all night.  Cant used any decongestants.  Another stupid thing I noticed a couple of years back was incontinence.  Coughing all nite causes me to pee constantly.  I hate it.  I do have to say that the med does definitely work with my other meds to lower the pressure.  I went from 235/130 average to 116/70.  So it does work even if I pee every time I cough.",4
"I sometimes have dizziness and have a dry cough. My blood pressure remains low and stable. I can not take decongestants, but have found that Children's decongestants work. My pharmacist recommended it because the dose is low. I have allergies and congestion is hard to get rid of.",4
Has worked well for my mild high blood pressure.  I take 20mg per day.  I have no side effects at all.,5
Works well controlling the high number of my blood pressure.,4
"i had this cough for 9 months now and seems to be getting worse dr up the dose and cough is even worse been have pain under rib cage and leg cramps, also not able to sleep at night this drug i feel is not for me bp has not gone done seems to go up see dr next week i will demand to be taken off if not i will get a new dr.",1

this medication is pretty easy for me. just started taking it and yes i do have a slight cough. i am also on famotidine and i can tell a difference on heart rate. blood pressure is still slightly elevated but i love the heart rate droppage. i'll see what continues to happen,3
Has reduced my bp from 155-160 to around 115-120 in about three months.  I have decided I can put up with the cough although it is annoying at times.  Still feel lightheaded or slightly dizzy at times.  ,4
i am using it with hctz adde for high blood pressure and fluid pill,5
it helps control  blood pressure issues,4
"Ever since my first episode of anxiety my blood pressure has been elevated and my doctor decided it was finally time to get on a blood pressure med. He prescribed Lisinopril. Hours after taking my first dose my upper abdomen hurt so bad as though I had some type of internal injuries. I began throwing up, fainting and ended up unable to walk much less even sit up for 3 days. I stopped taking it because I thought I had the flu and was too sick to even worry about my BP. When I got well I started the med again and my stomach had me doubled over in pain again for days. I finally read other reviews and learned from Lucky and Levettep it was this Lisinopril that was making me severely ill, like them. I saw my doctor and had to have an abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder problems. I ended up being treated for Gastritis and was told I had a bad allergic reaction to this drug. It's  been almost 2 months now and my stomach is still not healed. I have never in my life had a bad reaction to a drug like I did Lisinopril. No wonder it warns it can kill your unborn child if you're pregnant, I was so ill I felt as though it was going to kill me. Thank you to those who shared their experience with this drug, otherwise I don't think I would have figured out it was this BP med. that was making me so ill. The FDA should take a closer look at this dangerous medication and possibly recall it. I don't know if my stomach will ever completely heal!!!",1
"I've been having coughing and gagging with a tickle in my throat, also have sinus drainage which gets much worse when I lay down to sleep, if I can sleep with all the coughing and spitting up phlegm.  I also have a pain in the right side of my neck. Only been on  Lisinopril since end of May. I finally went to a throat specialist and he told me about this drug and this cough being one of the side effects.",3
intchinmg rash reaction,3
"This med is sooooo much better than Benicar!!  I take 10mg: My BP has been consistantly good, no big fluctuations, and No More Panic Attacks!  (thank God!)  So far, so good (3 months now).  Although I do still have some anxiety left over from when I was taking Benicar...hoping that will go away soon.  It's fairly annoying.  But the good news is Lisinipril has been ok for me.",5
I have ben prescribed 80 mgss per day and they only come as high as 40 mgs,2
Effect of taking this caused me to have a hacking dry annoying cough as if I were a smoker.  Had drug switched to Atenolol in the evening 25mg and in the morning Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg.  Took over a month to rid the cough.  Much happier now and BP is averaging 120/80 - age 54,1
should i take this med in am or pm?  I feel exhausted all the time,3
Have just been diagnosed with Diabetes and HBP - last read at the Dr. Ofc was 170/104. Dr. put me on 40mg per day which I take right before bed. I workout 4-5 days a wweek and watch what I eat. Goal weight is 170 - I'm 5'7 176lbs now so 6lbs to go - on 1800 to 2000 cals a day. Also talking 1000mgs of Metformin a day 500mg/day - 500mg / night  - So far so good. ,4
"I cough alot mainly at night. BP still 160/100 or close. Think I need to take 20mg instead of 10mg. Doctor says lets wait and see, but she's not the one thats dizzy and fatiqued all day!",3
Sometimes my BP goes dangerously low. I take 1/2 if over 140 and 1 whole if BP over 170 have been monitoring for Doctor for 2 weeks,3
Slight increase of cough at first. Other than that it's working just fine for me. I exercise and watch my my sodium intake which I'm sure is helping with my BP as well.,5
"I was taking Lisinopril for the past year now.  I started coughing soon after starting the drug but did not know it was a side effect.  I was coughing up to 100 times a day.  The cough got so bad that my dr. sent me to an allergist an ENT dr., plus chest xrays and lots of meds to try to control the cough.  I finally read about the side effects and got put on a med that is not an ACE.  My dr. never mentioned the side effects of this med.!!!  Even after a year of suffering daily and numerous appointments.  I feel like a fool for not looking this up sooner.  I still have the cough but it's getting less & less.",4
I have been taking this drug for a year and a half. Low dosage was not effective. Recently had dosage increased to 20mg form 10mg. Hopefully will lower BP more.,3
"I have had increases in this med since March with no change in BP, but increasing side effects. Doc said to ""be patient. Takes a while to work in some people."" I have tried other highBP meds without success, so put on lisinopril 10 mg. in May-mild dizziness and fatigue but no change in BP or 140/90 to 170/100. Increased to 20 mg in early August-chronic sore throat, fatigue, dizziness and balance problems worse. Increased to 30 mg. on Halloween. Sore throat became wet cough, insomnia, and draining nose. All getting worse and think these are from the Lisinopril. Money is limited, so have been patient in trying to get BP down. Have seen no change in BP and increasing side effects.",1
"dry coughs at nite. worse erectile disfunction. lot of sinus drainage when i lay down. ive also been having some weak muscles in my neck at night and a medicine head. ive been having some sinus issues, so i dont know how much of this is caused by the meds.",4
It is inexpensive which is a plus. I have had ddecent control of my blood pressure along with Bystolic. I have had a long term night cough that is very unforgiving and I just learned this medicine may be the cause. I hope not but need to know. I am loosing too much sleep from uncontrollable coughing.,3
Worked for a year then stopped.  Had a persistent dry cough while using it.  Many people have this side effect but it's not usually listed.,3
"had horrible cough from med.  Dr. did not believe me.  8 months of tx with that drug,and only upon my insistence that I get chest x-ray x2, blood wk and ekg did he finally decide that I should try another med.I had immediate relief from the cough!!!",1

"I have been on on Lisinopril and/or Zestril for 15 years. The medication has been effective in lowering my blood pressure. However, the side effects of Lisinopril/Zestril have included chronic facial swelling, memory impairment, and dizziness. The side effects interfere with my daily level of functioning. Only take this medication when there is a clear   medical indication for its usuage.   ",4
Just started but feel nauseous all the time,2

Wonder if the cough is the Lisinopril?",5
"was taking 20mg/day bp at Dr. office 140's. had several bouts of swollen tounge and face, Dr at er said it was food allergy(not).dr increased dose to 40mg/day- week later another episode of swelling tounge and lips. dr now changing med to hctz.",2
"BP was 210/90 before getting this med. After one month it was 150/80, and was given a double dose script. After one month BP went to 120/50 so with this and some light exercise and diet I feel confident it works with NO adverse affects.",4
"Had to switch from Hyzarr to Lisinopril, a less expensive drug. My doctor gave me samples to take for 3 week to see if I could tolerate it. Almost immediately I developed a cough which I thought was an allergy to weather changes. Now, in the third week, the cough is horrible especially at night or when lying down. (Includes heavy sinus drainage resulting in coughing to point of gagging) Definitely trying something else!     ",1

I been taking for a year now (40 mg). None of the side effects others have complained about. And this has not effected my sex drive at all! DR switched me from Atenolol to this drug because it also helps protect kidneys. So far very happy.,5
"Works good for my condition,however it makes me dizzy if I take during the daytime,so my doctor advised me to take at bedtime.",4
low blood persure,3

"I've been on lisonopril for 4 years (20mg/day).  Product works, but side effects include dizziness at times, headache, vertigo, and at times, one feels as if their head is going to explode.  BP stays low.  besides this med, also on verapamil, digoxin, aspirin, effexor XR, and others, due to heart problems and the end result of two open heart surgeries.   Still vertical and still a working stiff, instead of a 'dead' stiff.  A pill for everything, but things work.  too bad beer wasn't included in the therapy, I could use one or two everyday. lisonopril is cheap enough, and effective.",4

I have been using this medication for 14 years but it only works in combination with HCTZ (water pill).  The comibination is what makes it work.,5
b.p. goes from 118 to 179 within a few days,2
"My insurance just paid for over $600 worth of blood work because my doctor wasn't familiar with the side effects.  I've quit taking this junk - couldn't figure out why the cramps in my  toes, feet,and in my side under my rib cage just wouldn't go away - after reading these reviews, I know why!  I also have figured out the reason I can't sleep at night so we will advise the Dr and have him change my meds - I didn't have the terrible cough, but my husband has to be removed from this medication after only a weeks usage due to the cough!",3

I've experienced this for 7 years now. It's a result of extreme lowered BP. I've checked my BP when experiencing this feeling and my BP was 99 over 55 and yes, I literally felt like passing out.

I believe another reason I was put on it was because my kidneys were not processing protein, and I was expelling it. I've lost 12 lbs so far since not being able to have protein processed and retained.  I'm not happy about that because I am a bodybuilder -- I'm not a happy camper right now.

"This drug should be taken off the market.  My mom had to rush herself to the hospital at 3am on Friday 8/21/09 after the tonge and face had swollen.  Her tongue covered her entire mouth , I mean top to bottom and check to check.  The tongue covered her entire mouth.  Her face was almost swollen beyond recognition, and her tongue almost blocked her airway.  After she was admitted the Dr at the hospital explained that the mediation cause her tongue/face to swell and she probably needed a better medication. She thought she was having a stroke.  After a few calls from family members inquiring on her status.  I was shocked to see my grandfather (my mom's dad) and my great uncle (grandfathers brother) both has to be taken off Lisinopril after being rushed to the E.R for the same symptons.  I told my uncle since he and his wife are also on Lisinopril, he was shoked and said he would see his Dr. right away.  My moms morning nurse in the hospital told me to be sure when her pysicians follows up with her after being released, he doesn't prescribe anything in the "" Pril"" family of blood pressure medication.  Or any ACE Inhibitors, since they are know to have various side effects.  It also seems a lot of people have problems at or around 2+ years on Lisinopril.  It just a shame what is happening to so many people on this medication, I think the manufacturer knows this isn't a few cases, or random mishaps, it's a serious problem with this medication and I would avoid it at all cost !!!!",2

I am now on cozaar & i like   NO COUGH!!!!!! I was on LISINOPRIL  cough cough gag gag   for almost nine years so I i am one of the best case studies you will ever hear from. The cough started out light & after some years it got so bad I was bring up flem from my lungs & I also started having joint pains all over my body that I am starting to believe was caused by it.I say if you take it & start to have a slight cough or any other symptom STOP USING IT  PLEASE. COZARR has brought my blood pressure down to the normal range for the first time in almost ten years  116 TO 118 over  68  which is impressive for me because the lisinopril was never able to get my pressure below 130 over 80.  STAY AWAY FROM  LISINOPRIL.  your doctor will leave you on any meds you will continue to take unless you insist that they give you something that is better for you . they will tell you a little cough is normal.

So the doctor took me off it and I tried a bunch of other blood pressure medications that hardly helped and made me sooo dizzy all the time.

Since I was told Lisinopril is drug of choice for protecting kidneys for diabetics, and I have both issues (B/P and diabetes) I tried my hardest thinking the cough would subside, but never did.

I tolerated the dry cough. But the cough got much worse after the dosage was increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily.  It turned into an asthyma sounding cough.  I would almost black out at times.  I felt like I was drowning.  Doctor insisted that I get off lisinopril.  This time I agreed.  I am willing to try anything.  Had a chest x-ray-normal.  I have had the cough for seven months now.  I have only stopped the lisinopril for two days, so I am not sure if that is the cause of the chronic cough.  Doctor has been treating me for asthyma and allergies.

"Taking 40mg for 10 yrs. Occasional slight cough, but a chronic runny nose. Lately, having a tingling on left jaw & around mouth area, which could be because there is an interaction between Lisinopril & foods with potassium such as bananas, oranges, tomatoes and potatoes.",3
"I have been taking this med for one month.  I have developed such a bad cough, so much so to throwing up, puffy eyes from so much coughing.  Wake up 2-3 times night coughing and going to bathroom.

"I have had a bad cough and feeling like I am having an asthma attack for a couple of months.  Then yesterday it got worse and I was having trouble breathing.  Went to the doctor, after xray, cardiogram, & other tests, I was told everything was fine.  Then the doctor took me of of Lisinopril, and told me that was probably causing my problem.  ",4
I have taken for 5 years and starting not to control BP as well now on 40mg didnt know about cough until read reviews but now that I think about it I have had to use inhalers thinking it was alergies and I go through several bags of cough drops a week I am talking with my MD asap no cough until began this treatment,4

Dr. took me off it on 6/22/09 & put me on methylprednisolone 4mg to clear up symptoms. Much better now except I still have rashes/itching. Not aware of these problems before I read here. This has been a real wakeup call for me as I was surprised that side effects could take over 1 yr to show up!",4
after taking lisinopril for 3 month my bilirubin went up to 14.2. had various other problems that blood tests showed. problems lasted 6 weeks after being taken off medication.,1

"it keeps me in the bathroom,also takes my hair out",3
10mg per day for a year didn't do it for 24 hours. Now I take 10 mg every 12 hours and my pressure is normal. I've been 2x per day for 2 months,4
It has caused a low pressure situation during urination.,4
"I switched from Atenolol to Lisinopril about 20 days ago.  50 mgs. of Atenolol was making me extremely dizzy - like a drunk staggering around.  I switched to 5 mg. of Lisinopril.  The cough is a little irritating - my husband has commented on it, but I don't know how dangerous it is.  Maybe just irritating?  Anyway, the last two days I have had difficulty urinating - like I'm on the verge of a urinary tract infection.  I called the pharmacy, but they don't seem to think it is the drug.  I would like to know if anyone else has had this reaction to Lisinopril, or if it is just a coincidence.  Right now, I can't figure out if I need an antibiotic, or if this is just another irritating side effect that doesn't cause any real harm.",2
"Was on 20mgs for over 6 years and worked terrific with little or no side effects. Kept my BP within normal ranges but developed Angiodema(swelling of the lips, tongue & throat)a week ago and had to go to the ER. When the doctor informed me it was an alergic reaction to Lisinopril I was shocked!! Never would have thought it was that medication!! Has worked extremly well for me all this time but had to discontinue taking it.  ",5
Lisinopril gave me a horribly distressing dry cough that has continued months after I stopped taking the drug.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.,1
Started taking Lisinopril 5mg 4 mos ago Bp was 180/110 after 3 wks still high. increase to 20mg/12.5 hctz.after 1 wk got so dizzy and headache real bad Dr cut dose in half to 10 mg now I have a bad rash on both arms an legs with head ache gets worse in the sunshine.

Low heart rate,4
"After taking this med for 10 days, left side of upper lip began to swell at 0330. By 0800 upper lip was so big, it covered bottom lip.  Took Benadryl and received a steroid shot from doctor. 24 hours later, my lip and face are still swollen.",2
I'm no Doctor but I have been using this medication to control my blood pressure and for the last ten years my blood pressure has been better than normal. I also included physical exercise (badminton/yoga/walking) into my daily routine. I can only say that I believe my change to active lifestyle and this medication has had positive effects on lmy HBP restoring it to a normal BP.,5
"I sometimes have a dry hacking cough which is annoying at night.  Seems to also cause moderate erectile dysfunction after about 40 minutes of sex.  You can get your erection back to finish the session, but when you're not used it losing it, it can be a little disconcerting.",4
I HAVE A CHRONIC COUGH WHICH KEEPS ME AWAKE AT night. This is a side effect of the med.,4
"Took this med for 1 1/2 years worked great then one night I wook up with my tongue and throat swollen and right side of my face drewping. Yes I had a stroke!!! When I got to the ER the doctor asked me what kind of HBP med was I on, I told them Lisinopril and they told me that having this stoke was one of the side affects! I was taking a med to lower my bp so I wont have a stoke and the same med caused me to have one. I would look for another med. and research it before taking it.",1
only took two doses of 10 mil and started to sweat and had real loose bowls and stomach nausea and dark urine. stopped immeaditly and still have loose bowls and stomach aches. Will never take it again. it's pretty bad when the possibe side effects are worse than the origanl problem. Who wants to take somthing that can be fatal and cause severe liver damage.,1
Been on lisinopril and hafe of clondine 3xday for 1 week hart rate up over 100.,1
"I have been taking this medicine for three years.  This morning I woke up and my right upper lip was completely swollen.  While at the ER, the doctor said that it was a common side effect--even if the person had taken it for a prolonged period of time. I had to go back to the ER about 3 hours later because my mouth became even bigger! As I was checking in, a nurse looked at my mouth and said, ""Oh, you take Lisinopril, right? I see that reaction all the time here, plus, I had it myself.""  The second Dr. came out and told me my airwaves and oxygen were okay and that I was just going to have to wait it out (they had earlier prescribed me Benyadryl and a steroid). Then he explained he had to stop using the medicine himself because is tongue became swollen. This is a common occurance. And if you are like me, you assume if you are going to have a reaction to a medicine, it's going to be rather early.  This side effect can take time before it shows. Be careful, apparently it is a very common incident with this drug.  ",5
I have been taking it for 2 years. No problems to report,5
I HAD DRY COUGH THAT KEPT ME UP AT NIGHT.,4

If I had any less energy I'd be a plant. Done with this..there has to be a better way.",3
"I have been taking this medication for two months and had to call my doctor to change me to something else; I developed a cough, to the point of dry heaves, that was getting worse the longer I took it. I was hoping that as my body adjusted to the medication the cough would not be as bad, as it did help dramatically in lowering my blood pressure, but that didn't happen.",5
"LOWER BP,NO FEELING OF FATIGUE OR NAUSEA",4
developed severe chest pain and terrible dry cough to the point of dry heaves.  Went to ER as advised by my doctor to only find out it was this horrible drug.  Drug maker should have to pay my hospital bills for three days and stress test!!!!!!!!!!,3

The treatment was two ER visits and two operations to the tune of $50,000!!!  I stopped the medicine pronto and found a woman doctor who is working with me to take me off of it slowly.  Loose weight no bacon etc.  Feel so much better to be off of the medicine.",2

"I started taking lisinopril in Oct. 2008. Developed a drippy nose, and a cough; did not think it was the med.  In Feb. Dr. increased dosage (even tho bp had dropped) 3 days later I developed allergy symptoms; congestion,very runny nose and loss of hearing. Went to Dr. took cipro 10 days; no help; saw reports so cut med in half and seemed better; hearing better; May 27 developed severe sinus infection (never before had one) took Z-Pak 10 days; added 2 more antibiodics and hearing is still getting worse.  Beware of ototoxic drugs - ask Drs.  Am seeing Dr. in 2 days and have an appt. to ear/nose/throat spec. next week. Hearing loss may be irreversible.  It did help my blood pressure, but so did my prev. one. Worse part is you have these problems and impossible to see Dr. - and they dont always listen. Should have seen spec. earlier, but as one Dr. said ""you just need a hearing aid""  I told my new  Dr. that I will not take lisinopril again. Does anyone else notice hearing loss - I am very hard of hearing and can't hear phone ring and I was the one who ""heard"" a pin drop til this started.  Be careful of drugs!  I only found out about the side effects on this site - thank you!   Dr.",4

"With my primary care physician's approval,I just stopped taking Lisinopril after 90 days on 5MG per day.  the medicine reduced my blood pressure to a healthy level but it gave me an INTENSELY awful salty taste in my mouth and a white salty film all over my tongue that no amount of brushing, flossing, scrapping, and gargling could get rid of despite my best and frequent efforts. this happened from the very first dose and never let up even though the salty taste and film were supposed to go away as i continued to take the medication.  needless to say, after 90 days there was no improvement whatsoever.  it's been awful.  i know 7 people in my circle of friends and relatives that had to stop taking this drug due to the cough.  i never developed the cough but i could not tolerate the side effects i was experiencing for even one more day.  i hung in there as long as i could.  right now i am taking nothing until this taste/film go away at which time my doctor plans to prescibe an ARB to treat my HBP.

A few days after I began taking Lisinopril I started to have a tickle in my throat. I would cough all day and night. My cough was so fierce that my windpipe got raw. Every time I coughed it felt like I was catching a cold. I would get a feeling in my nose  like you would if you were getting sick. I stopped taking Lisinopril about three weeks after I started taking it. I developed a SEVERE sinus infection and was put on 1500mg of AMOXICILLIN. I continue to have coughing that will not go away despite stopping this medication more then 2 months ago. I have never (I'm 52) had any kind of sinus problems until I took Lisinopril.

Insurance requirement for me to change to cheaper lisinopril vs. Benecar HCT which I have had no prob's with for 2 years. Thought I had a strange sinus infection where I would absolutely drown at night with post nasal drip. 3 dr trips and a mountain of antibiotic later where as soon as I would stop it would come back I wised up and changed back to Benecar that I had left over. Got better within 24 hours. Lisinopril was a nightmare for me. Now the damn insurance company has me trying diovan HCT. I'll be sure to monitor the situation this time instead of suffering on lisinopril for a month! ,2
"Started this medication April 1st due to losing my job and could not afford Atacand any longer. Had side effects within couple days with leg cramps, nightmares,anxiety,insomia,sweating, ruberly legs. Then 8days into taking medicine cough started, heavy mucous in throat,sinus congestion and headache and throat tickle,allergy symptoms.Coughing so bad was throwing up all the time from the mucous. In last 7 weeks been to doctor twice-I have had 4 shots, 2 breathing treatments, 2 z-packs of prednisone, 2 different antibodies, 3 cough medicines and two nasal sprays,2 blood tests and one chest x-ray. Nothing showed up in any of the tests. Each time I would get better on medicine, then relapse 2 days after completing medicine. I thought at the time I was dealing with two separate problems,side effects from lisinopril and upper respiratory infection. Last night I tried to attend my grandson ballgame and coughed so much, lost my breath couldn't swallow from mucous in throat, felt like I was drowning from fluid. After I got home got onto internet and read these reviews,and knew right away it was the Lisinopril, not upper respiratory infection.I have not taken one since Thursday night, will call cardilogist Mon. and report side effects and go onto something else. If you start taking this medicine and cough starts, stop immediately, because it only gets really worse after that. Trying to save monjey by going onto genetic, and have spent close to $500.00 in last 6 weeks.",2
"My doctor prescribed this to treat high bp - 144/90.  He prescribed lexapro at the same time.  I'm not sure why my bp increased.  It could be my anxiety, or my hot flashes, or my job stress.

"My doctor prescribed this medication, because my blood pressure was running a little high the last three times I went there for an appointment. About a week before seeing the doctor, before he had put me on lisinopril, I was downtown and thought I was fixing to have a heart attack or a stroke, because my face felt numb. Anyway, I saw a policeman and he called an ambulance and I ended up finding out from the emergency room doctor that I was experencing those problems because my blood pressure was too high. That week before going to the doctor, I couldn't even walk half a block before experiencing bad symptoms. A week after my doctor put me on this drug, I could do my regular daily activities with NO PROBLEMS any more! It was like a miracle drug for me. I still got to watch what things I eat and how much sodium I put into my body, but I think this drug works great most of the time. I have been on it for 18 months now.

After I would sit down for a while and try to stand, I would barely be able to walk.  My ankles would hurt so bad.  One Sunday while sitting in a recliner I had to put a pillow behind my back to ease the aching I was feeling.

The cough started in Nov., 2008(the beginning of cold weather) and continued until one week after I stopped the drug.  I thought I had lung cancer-even tho I don't smoke!Now I have lost my senses of tasting and smelling. Is it connected?  I know the cough was caused by the drug because of all the reviews I had read online.  Be careful with this drug. ",4

"When my dosage was changed from two times a day at 5 mg to once a day 10 mg, I had severe diarrea and leg cramping for two days. this started happening 3 days after the dosage change.  I believe it caused dehydration at that doasage one time a day causing these systmes. Until it get with my doctor, I am changing the dosage back to the orginal 5 mg two times a day.

"I had severe muscle cramps in my legs, difficulty walking or standing, dizziness, pain in knees and ankles.  The leg muscles swelled and it was very painful to walk.  I felt like my legs were becoming paralyzed. This was Lisinopril/HCTZ 12.5 mg HCTZ (hydrochlorithiazide) has worked well for me alone, as has Metoporal.  The Lisinopril affected me for about 12 hours.  I do not know why it affected me or what it did to my body but I will not be taking it again.  Warnings for muscle cramps was in my pharmacy handout but I did not see it here.  ",1
Brought BP down quickly but made me tired and hungry most of the time and gave me a cough.  I am going to try diuretics instead. ,5

"I have taken lisinopril for almost 3 years now, i just switched from 10 to 20mg. It works pretty well, it keeps my blood pressure down. The only side effect that I have from switching to a  higher dose is nausea, not severe nausea though.",4
"I've been taking this med for 4 days now, and I feel awful.  The I had to call in to work the second day I was on it because I woke up and felt like I hadn't slept at all.  I have been very tired and weak.  High BP is a hereditary problem for me, but I am considering going the all-natural route to solve this problem.",3
"Originally I was taking 40 mg./day and for the past year have decreased to 20 mg./day.  The fact that I have refrained from any alcohol, decreasing my salt intake and taking 2000 mg./day of Omega 3 has helped tremendously in lowing my blood pressure.

"Have been on medication for bp for about 3 weeks. Felt great when I went to the Dr. Now I have headaches, nausea, dizziness, and last night the pain in my chest and back were so bad I was afraid I was having a heart attack. Would rather take no meds and concentrate on physical changes rather than drug therapy. Feel ""crappy"".",3
"I took 20mg per day for three years to treat HBP. Developed the night time, itchy back of throat cough, metalic taste, sometimes dizzy when first standing up, noticable reduction of libido, restless sleep and many times waking from sleep feeling very warm, sometimes sweating, and my heart rate very high.  After reading most of these postings, decided enough of this!  I needed to change my eating habits, lose weight and exercise.  I cut my dose in 1/2 for a month, then down to 1/4 for another month.  Check with your doctor before reducing your dose.  During this time I ate less and better, and began to exercise at least five days a week, 30 plus minutes a day.  I now sleep soundly, no waking up overheated, no itchy cough, metalic taste is gone, dizzy no more.  After four months, I weigh 30 lbs less with 25 lbs to more to go.  Point is, ditch the meds and take control.  ",3

lots of side effects,3
"After using this drug I developed a cough, and my sinus's became inflamed and had a stuffy nose and head.  I thought it was due to my allergies, and I didn't tell the doctor about the cough, although I did tell him about my sinus;s and stuffy head.  Make sure that you mention the cough, or the doctors do not link that symtom with Lisinopril.",1
Great job lowering my blood pressure without side effects.  I changed to this pill after trying hydrothiazide which did nothing for me. This medication is free when I get it from Krger and through AETNA.,5
My doctor just put me on this drug to prevent migraines...we're trying yet another preventative drug.  Can anyone tell me if Lisinopril works for migraine prevention?,3
"It is funny after reading everyones comments. I was searching for my mom actually, she been on Lisinopril for about 4+ years and she has been complaining about sore muscles and trouble sleeping, trouble swallowing and very fatigue. The doctor even gave her medication for depression so she can sleep. I even thought she had fibromi---- (can't spell either) but nothing, thank you very much for the comments I will have her check out. Maybe all those years of pain has to do with the high blood pressure medication.",3
I started taking this medication in Jan 09 and after 3 days my vision was blurry and ended up at the Opthamologist with a new eyeglass Rx not knowing it was this medication.  I also have body aches and coughing.  I thought the body aches were laying restless in the bed at night but now know thats probably from this drug as well.  I also experience the lightheadedness.  Will be going to the Dr next week and see if I cant get this medication changed!,3
"I have taken 1 pill so far and I have now had severe dizziness, ringing in my left ear, fast heartbeat and a very uneasy feeling.  Until changing to this medicine, I had been taking a diuretic to control my HBP but my doctor felt that I needed something different but I am on my way to his office at this time to definately get SOMETHING DIFFERENT!!",1
"I started taking Lisinopril on 4/1/09. I had side effects of a dry cough, spitting up, and it continued until 4/7/09 when I switched back to Benicar. My pharmacist said the Lisinopril has an ACE Inhibitor ingredient and the Benicar does not. A lot of people have coughing, etc reactions. I only tried the Lisinopril becacuse of cost of $4 vs Benicar $40 thru Humana prescription drug plan",2
"I found the drug to be very effective in lowering my blood pressure--especially the top number which I was having problems with--High BP is rampant on both sides of my family.  HOWEVER, since I started Lisinopril, I have developed a hacking, dry cough and my Dr. is taking will prescribe another drug.  H.ope this doesn't have to everyone",5
seems to help my high blood pressure,4
"i take this drug daily with morvasc to control my high blood pressure.  It usually keeps my blood pressure around 125/85, plus or minus.",5
I posted a self review yesterday but after reading some of the complants from people I realise I have had alot of the problems as well. After a day or two taking lisinopril I started tossing & turning in bed not able to sleep because my musles were sore. I thought I was getting fibromialgia. (can't spell) I will say it has gone away now but I still have this wad of flim in my throat I just can't seem to swallow. It does work for me if I can do somthing about this flim. My BP was 134/ 82 at the Dr's office the other day and it hasen't been that low for a long time. I also get very tired very quick and just don't feel like doing a thing. The DR dismissed it as being lazy but I think it is the medicine. I'm 62 and what I think is fairly healthy for that age. I was wondering if anyone has had the flim in the throat?,5
"Was prescribed as a generic replacement to Diovan. I ended up with a cough, sometimes very strong, day and night. Once off the Lisinopril the cough was gone in 7 weeks. I went back to the Diovan.",1
"I don't know if this medicine helps, but it causes lighted headedness and dizziness which is very extremely bothersome.",2
"spasmatic cough -- especially at night.  I've been with 5 mg and I have mildly high blood pressure, I don't smoke, not over-weight -- my dr is now going to put me on cozaar.",2
Only experienced one side effect after taking Lisinopril for 2 1/2 months. My libido went from very strong to ZERO! Same with performance. Seeing Doc tomorrow. ,4
"Lisinopril has lowered my blood pressure.  I have been on this medication for about 3 years. However, I am constantly dizzy.  I did experience the dry cough for a few months, but that went away. My vision is somewhat blurry at times too. If I forget to take it for a day, I get terrible diarrhea.  Has anyone stopped taking this and found a more suitable medication?",4
I have read 50 to 60 comments I seem to be getting along better than most. I'm having a problem with a what I call flim in my throat that I can't seem to swallow. I have tryed to gargle it away. I've tryed to eat bread but I can't swallow it. As I'm typing this there is a jag of it in my throat right now and it's driving me crazy. Other than that and getting tired really really fast I must be doing OK. Has any one had a lump of flim in their throat that no matter what they do you just can't swallow it?,4
I had the coughing when I first got the medication but after 6 months it went away. It does make me very tierd but I use it right before I go to sleep and this seems to help with that issue. Been on lots of bp meds this has the least side effects for me,4
"I was on this medication for approx 3 months, developed awful cold, then the coughing started.  Cold went away but the coughing attacks intensified, especially at night.  Blood pressure increased to high again.  Lisinopril did not work for me. Doctor switched me to Diovan HCT.  Hopefully this will work better.",1
After taking this medication for almost two weeks I have developed that awful cough .. I was told to take one 10mg tablet every day I am stopping and going back to see my physician this cough is awful...what other options are there? Do they all come with some type of side effect?,3
I developed a very dry cough and running nose with episodes sometimes very bad ,3
absolutely no side effects at all and blood pressure from 200/100 to 130/80..,5
"I have been taking this drug for a little over a month.  I was aware the cough was the most common side effect, but was unaware of the anxiety, sleep disruptions, low sex drive and loss of concentration until I started reading the other comments.  I have all of these symptoms, so I called my doc today to have my meds changed.  I hope I can find something without all of these side effects.",5

I have been on the drug for over 3 yrs.  I have gotten BP under control.  Haven't experienced the coughing that people are commenting on though.,5

I am experiencing leg cramping at night,3
"Anxiety attacks, racing pulse at times (120's), my heart feels like it's going to pound out of my chest at night, severe fatigue, muscle soreness in my arms, shoulders and neck, And after reading other reviews I now know why.  Took my last one last night-going to see doc on Monday.  ",3
After taking this drug for one month(5mg)and my doctor taking me off Zebeta my blood pressure went up drastically. My doctor felt that I needed to up the dose to (10mg)- and it did not help! (160/113 p114)  This drug caused aweful side effects including a deep cough. I went back in to the doctor because I thought maybe something was wrong with my home bp cuff...it wasn't wrong - my bp was going up and getting worse.  She took me off and put me back on Zebeta (10mg) and the pressure this morning is back to 124/82 p 67.    I really believe if I kept taking this drug it would have led to a heart attack based on my body reaction.,1
"I have been taking 10mg 2x daily for about 1 year and it has lowered my bloodpressure, 129/89. Tonight in a desperate attempt to get information on my severe cough and asthma/bronchial spasms, I accidentally ran into an article linking lisinopril. It never crossed my mind that this could be the reason for my severe allergy and asthma attacks. Since the begining of 2009, I have been treated three times with the Z-pak and have to keep my albutorol inhaler on my person. One incident was so severe, I had to be taken to the ER. These coughing attacks usually occur at nights. I have an appointment to see an allergist/immunologist for next week. Reading about 100 of these reviews tonight have brought tears to my eyes because of how much I have been suffering with these symptoms over the past year. I will stop this medication immediately and will see my Dr on Monday. I do also experience extreme fatigue, extreme heartburn, weightgain and lightheadedness quite regularly. This is amazing.

"Foot cramps at night, coughing, scratchy throat, shortness of breath, anxiety attacks, dizziness, diarreah, runny nose,  and it seemed to get worse every day. This is a horrible poison. From now on, I will check this website before purchasing meds. I suggest you ask your doctor for samples because it seems that bp meds all have side effects, and you have to choose the one that will affect you the least. Bad medicine! ",2
"Well I was very surprised after reading at least 30 reviews; but now I know why I have my coughing, especially at night. I have been on this med since Jan 2006. Due to my multi-level disk desinegration & bulging disks I figured that was why my BP was often unstable & in the low high range for HBP..I need to see a doctor about possibly changing this med to something else.",3
"After taking 10MG daily for just 2 weeks I started experiencing shortness of breath, anxiety attacks at night, slight dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision and pain in the chest, back of neck and right arm.  After reviewing over 500 of these reviews I am now convinced that these symptoms are related to Lisinopril. I definitely need to address my BP problem, but not be with this drug!",3
"I was on 10mg/day and it was not working. The doctor increased it to 20mg/day and seems to be working, have not been on 20mg long enough to tell.  I now have metalec taste in my mouth 24/7.",3
"Tired, heavy head feeling, burning of ears...",1

"I started taking lisinopril 20mg Nov. 12, 2008. I've never smoked poison ivy before, but that's how I describe the constant side effect. Sinus and upper jawbone/gums, upper chest. Does keep the BP down.",4
THIS MEDICINE CAUSED ME TO HAVE EXTREME HEART POUNDING. AT TIMES I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WAS HAVEING A HEART ATTACK.,1
"This medication caused severe swelling of my upper lip after only one 10 mg dose.  Approximately 18 hours after taking the first dose, the swelling started.  At first it was just a small portion of my upper lip.  By the end of dinner, it was my whole upper lip.  It looked like a collagen treatment gone bad.  I didn't go to the emergency room that night, because I knew it wasn't an allergic reaction, but when I got up the next morning and the swelling was moving into the skin directly under my nose, I did go to an urgent care clinic.  Luckily my fears weren't completely justified.  I was told not to take any more of the meds and to take a steroid for 5 days to mitigate the effects of the Lisoprinil as it worked it's way out of my system.  Thank heavens the swelling went down.  I was getting all kinds of stares.  My boyfriend jokingly referred to it as duck lips once we both knew it was something that could be easily treated.  It's funny now, but scared the heck out of me when I saw how much swelling was present.  Be careful with this one!",1
"Drymouth,coughing, an side pain an dizzyness",4
"Unfortunately I forgot this med causes cough. I went to 3 different Dr's/Nurse Pract. at the same practice. They all gave me Z-pak antibiotics and cough medicine. The problem came back after 10 months, then 5 months, then 2 months. Finally I got in to my prescribing Doctor. The first thing he said was ""Lisinopril causes cough"" and took me off it.",4
"Been on it a month (5mg).  No noticeable side effects and it appears to be working in bringing down my BP. I am about 30 lbs overweight and I am also combining this with walking, drinking a lot of water, and overhaul of my diet which may be helping also.",5
"The medicine is working; however the side effects are awful.  I am experiencing severe dizziness, neck pains, side aches, and ligtheadedness.  ",4
I am wondering if this medicine can cause you to have coughing episodes.,4

"i have been taking 5 MG of linsinopril for about 2 and a half weeks.  my blood pressure has gone down from the low 150's/low 90's to low 130's/low 80's.  i am sleeping OK, and no cough (yet?), no dizziness (yet?) but the medicine leaves an awful bitter/salty/metallic taste in my mouth 24/7 that i can't get rid off despite my best oral hygiene efforts.  has anyone else experienced this? the taste is very intense and gross. i am considering trying another medication.",5
"Been on it for 2 months. Take 20 mg. at night which causes extreme dry mouth, stomach upset, and severe leg cramps! Toss and turn all night. Dr. said to stop taking it temporarily, and I have. BP back up. Will try again in a 2-3 weeks to see if symptoms return.",2
This drug has lower my blood pressure and I have a good night sleep.,5
Only on it for 4 weeks so far for high BP (5 mg).  It appears to be working and I've  not experienced any dizziness or coughing as others have.  I am presently about 30 lbs overweight and I pretty much know that's a good portion of my BP problem anyway so I also started walking again - about 2 miles a day and do some lifting of low weight dumbells about 3 nights a week and drink a lot more water to flush my system.  Maybe this is helping keep away  some of these symptoms.  Also have elderly father in home who cannot use salt so low sodium has always been a way of life here which also helps so we'll see how continued use gets.  ,5

The worst spike was 175 over 134 with a pulse of 127 while not doing anything but sitting. This hurt so bad I thought I was going to die.

"In taking this medicine I've had neck pain on left side, numbness in fingers and feet, acne flare up (48 years old),cough, sore throat, fatige so bad was in bed for two days. Quit medicine two days ago and trying to get back to normal.  Going back to Dr. to try and get another medication for high blood pressure.  Did get blood pressure down but not worth the side effects.",2
"I was on this medicine for over five years, during which time my blood pressure was well-controlled and I experienced none of the side effects others have reported (coughing, muscle weakness, etc.).  However, I had a sudden allergic reaction which landed me in the emergency room after my tongue swelled so badly that it was affecting my breathing.  This has happened to two other people I know -- coincidentally all of use middle-aged African Americans.  After doing some research, I discovered that the incidence of allergic reactions to ACE inhibitors is approximately doubled in the African-American population than in the general population. ",5

"Have recently begun taking Lisinopril due to Insurance cutbacks on my Zestril. My co-pay was increased, which made Lisinopril much cheaper. I feel lousy on the Lisinopril, light-headed, spacey, not focused, unusual knee pain, and drowsy.  I plan to go back to Zestril immediately.  It did a great job for me, kept my BP down, without any side effects.  Lisinopril has not kept my numbers as low as they should be.  BP is elevated, and the air-headedness is ridiculous.  I even got a speeding ticket!  Haven't had one in 40 yrs! Just wasn't focused on my driving, which is unusual.  That's dangerous.  Returning to my Zestril...pronto!  You get what you pay for in this world. I won't skimp on meds again....",2

"This drug nearly killed me.  i was sick for three months after starting this drug, with severe congestion, nonstop coughing, bad headaches, hives and flu like symtoms.  My Family Dr. finally decided it was the Lisinopril that was causing all my symtoms. I don't have any drug allergies so we didn't realize the Lisinoprel was the sole cause of all my problems.",1
"Was on this med approximately 6 months, felt great, and bp was stable around 118/75 to 125/82.  Started having sore throat, cough, vomitting, and dizziness.  Thought I had the flu.  Too dizzy to stand or walk.  Went to ER. BP was 197/100.  Waited 10 hours, was never seen, and went home.  BP had come down to 180/94.  Saw my DR. the next day.  Treated for flu (antibiotic) and increased bp med. 2 weeks later, still sick.  Bp has not come down below 148/88.  After 3 weeks, finally feeling better, but bp is still a little high.

I am on 2.5 mg of this medication. I have not had any side affects nor have I been worried about it. I take this medication in the morning just before breakfast.,5
"I decided to ask my doctor to switch me to a medicine that was cheaper and she put me on Lisinopril.  After taking this medicine for 7 days I called my doctor and went back on Benicar.  I felt horrible on the Lisinopril, very weak, extremely tired, muscle aches and several episodes of dizziness.  It wasn't worth me saving a few dollars a month to feel that miserable. I have NO side effects with the Benicar and it works for me.   ",5
Have felt muscle pain in my hips since talking drug.,4
"I am taking it with bisoprolol/hctz and sometimes amlopipine for high blood pressure. I now have muscle weakness and don't know whether any of these, or a combination of these is causing it. The blood pressure does go down with usage.",3
"Not really sure why I'm on this drug,I was given the drug for weak heart muscle.",3
Slight hypertension reduced to normal levels.,5
I was taking this medication for about 4 months went into denial about my blood pressure level started to experience bad feelings and now back on medication ,4
My doctor switched me from Calan to Lisinopril because I was retaining too much water.  In addition to being treated for high blood pressure I am being treated for asthma.  No matter what my doctor prescribed to control my coughing spells it did not help.  By accident I discovered that Lisinopril causes coughing spells in some patients.  I stopped taking Lisinopril and the coughing spells and asthma have both gone away.  I now take Telmisartan (Micardis) and my blood pressure is just where my doctor thinks it ought to be.,3

"Was prescribed this medicine for HBP, which it did work, but after using it for approximately 6 mos., I developed an allergy, swelling of face, throat and could not swallow.  After being rushed to the emergency room and giving them the list of my meds, the ER Doctor knew immediatly what caused the reaction and was able to reverse the effect.  This medicine almost took my life.",1
Took for nine days. Extreme fatigue; could not get out of bed hardly. Pharmacist said not to take my Benicar while takiing this med. After nine days I stopped the Lisin and resumed Benicar and strength returned.,1

"About 4 years ago I complained to my Dr. that the Zestril I was taking wasn't working anymore,(I read my pressure at home),so she put me on Lisinopril,little did I know it was the same med. My pressure did come down but I felt tired.  I also suffer from depression and anxiety,so I contributed alot of the side effects to that. I started having chest discomfort,like a throbby heart beat and then skipping beats and the Dr. raised my antidepressants,but I still had that chest discomfort. I went through a battery of heart tests and all were negative,my heart was in good condition,BUT the discomfort would come and go.  Last summer I developed a pain in my left side and my vision was getting blurry. I saw the Eye Dr. and I had an eye infection,which seems to return each spring for the past 2 years.  The chest discomfort was really bad the past 2 years and I had no idea that this med was noted for this condition.  I saw my Dr. 2 days ago because I'm sick of feeling this bad,she didn't change the meds.just said that she thought maybe I needed some more tests on my heart.  After reading all of these reviews,I now know that the Lisinopril is responsible for them.  I trusted my Dr. to help me but when I point out that the meds are the cause of my discomfort and it is ignored,I have to wonder just how much she really does know. My BP is down and has been,but these side effects are killing me,as I can't sleep at night,I have the sinsus drainage,and a general feeling of unwellness,not to mention leg pain.  I love to read but everytime I set down to read I fall asleep and after reading a few pages,my vision is so blurry I can't see the words on the pages,I had my eyes examined and changed glasses last spring and I still can't see good.",3

"steady increase in blood pressure, unexplained weight gain, tiredness, dizziness",2
"I have taken Lisinopril for 5 years and it controlled my blood pressure very effectively.  However, each winter I would have extremely chapped lips, with a red almost kool-aid stain looking rash around my mouth and my lips would be swollen in the morning.  It was attributed to allergies, however after switching doctors, I explained this to my new doctor and she immediately attributed it to the lisinopril and switched me over to Cozaar.  Since switching my lips have not been extremely chapped swollen and the rash has not appeared.",4
my blood pressure with this medicine has improved.,4
"My Husband started taking this medication about 3 weeks ago. I have seen a noticable change in his health. The problems started with a harsh cough and then lead to problems with breathing,fast heartbeat,sleeping two hours or less at night,and extreme tiredness. He thinks it will all go away without going to the doctor but after reading these reviews I hope he will go.",2

"I have been on this drug for about 6 months and it has helped me lower my blood pressure. Like many others here I began to have a dry cough with gagging. At first it was just at night but now has become constant during the day also. I called my doctor after talking to a friend and reading these reviews. I will no longer be taking this drug, if I need more than my atenonl we will visit this later. I have had heaviness in the chest, and feel tired all the time. I had been attributing this to having a stent placed several months ago. Spent a whole bunch of money on additional stress tests and nuclear heart testing since the stent. I am thinking this medication could have been causing many if not all of my symptoms. The troubling part is none of these side effects which I discussed with my Dr. and the testing personnel were attributed to this drug. Just more tests. To say I am somewhat disturbed by this is an understatement. ",4
"I used this medicine for many years(~15).  Then I had a times where my tougue swelled during the night and I had to have steroid treatments etc.  After three of these over a 6 month time frame, I was told by one emergency room doctor, that lisinopril was the cause and to stop taking it.  I did and was fine for a month or so but then had another tongue swelling episode.  Now total cofusion with this product and my condition.",4
This drug works well in reducing high BP but it reduced mine to almost nothing.It went as low as 88/53 when I called my doctor.I just thank God I had a device to take my BP at home.I don't know what would have happened.I would have passed out for sure but then what?Be very careful taking this med and please check your BP at home.,5

"I have been taking this medication for nearly three years and thought all the dry coughing and gagging was from smoking (I have stopped) but yet the severe dry hacking cough still continues.  I have a nasal drip I thought was due to allergies but I now feel are from the medication.  One stroe I was getting my meds from gave me a report on each drug I had to take well, with the price of gas and distance I had to drive I changed pharmacies and they gave reports on drugs also.  That's when I found out this mediction can cause dry cough.  (one pharmacy report contains this info and the other doesn't)so all this time I have been coughing and gagging and now it feels like there is something caught in the back of my throat.  I am going to the Dr. Feb. 26th.  I hope there isn't any permanent damage to my throat.",4

I also became severely constipated and my urine output was drastically reduced no matter how much I drank.  I was tired all the time, my heart would palpitate occasionally, and I had trouble catching my breath. After 3 weeks I called my doctor to complain of the cough only to be prescribed a cough medicine which didn't touch the problem.  I couldn't sleep at night because of the cough even with sleep aids.  I had trouble focusing on the simplest of tasks at work and had blurred vision.  I finally got online to research the dry cough (I was afraid it was throat cancer) only to find an abundance of sites associated with side effects of lisinopril.  I immediately stopped taking the drug.  It's been 5 days and the cough is still as bad as it was before.  I've never been more miserable in my life.",1

I had taken Lisinopril for years and one day my tongue swelled up and was as hard as a golf ball. I saw a nurse practitioner at my PCP's office and she didn't even connect it to my medication. The second unplanned trip to the ER and the doctor there told me that this is a common side effect. I have an appt to see an allergist and the ER doctor says he's sure the allergist will agree with him.  Life threatening side effects are incredibly scary. Reading others reviews today also show me that I have other side effects that I wasn't aware of.  The next prescription will be discussed very thoroughly.,3
"COUGHING SIDE EFFECT! I Developed a brutal dry cough and increased nasal mucus, but I attributed it to post nasal drip and/or dust from heating vents in my new workplace.

icannotrealytellihavenotbeenbutaweek,2
I join those who ended up in the ER with chest discomfort because my doctor would not listen to me.  The drug lowered my bp but the side effects were too much for me to take.  My doctor did not seem concerned when I told him of chest discomfort because of my age but a person should not have to feel like or worry about having a heart attack.  So yup this drug does side effects other than the nasty cough.,3

I have been on this med for about 2 yrs and I can truly say that when I first started I have thick and full hair and I have always colored my hair but I noticed my hair started getting really weak in different areas in my head and my sister is a stylist said she bet it was my meds I was taking because we see alot of people that take high blood meds with their hair breaking from the root. My I can say that as I continue to take my meds and treat my hair I have nice and thick hair again and haven't had any more problems with my hair again. I do notice that I cough alot and I was talking with a friend that take meds for her high blood that said she bet I'm probably coughing from the meds and I went to the doctor and mentioned it to him about all the coughing since he increased my meds from 10 to 20 mgs now he stated that it could be from the meds and he schedule me to come back within 3 weeks to see if I'm still having the cough he will consider putting me on another one. But overall I can say I haven't notice any other signs or discomforts with taking the med and my blood pressure is under controll at this point and the increase in my meds was due to stress when my grandmother was extremely sick with cancer before passing.,5
"I started on a low dose of 5mg a few days ago.  So far so good, with only very occasional minor lightheadedness symptoms.  My BP was at 145/98, now it's at 113/72 (resting).  No joke!!!  Much better than the CCB I was on.  ",5

I started taking Lisinopril in November - developed a hacking/gagging cough by Thanksgiving. Constantly feel as though I've got a mucus ball at the back of my throat. I was to by my MD that it was an asthma flare up - now I read all of these reveiws with very similar comments to what I'm experiencing. I'm going off of this med - I knew it was too good to be true. The only way I can sleep at night is if I take cough syrup with narcotics in it... It did lower by BP though. ,4

ok,3
"Using this drug has lowered my BP. I have been on it for 9 months. A cough has developed which mostly happens when I get into bed. Other symptoms are no energy/tired, heartburn, constipation, which I never experienced before. I find my BP level creeping up 10 15 points lately. I plan to find another BP med soon. ",4
"Lisinopril does a great job of lowering bp, however, if you are among those who develop a cough from this drug, you and your doctor may need to consider other options.  I developed a terrible, hacking cough that kept me up at night and is very difficult to quiet.  For me, the cough did not respond to water, cough drops or cough medicine.  I have been off this drug for almost a week and the cough has only abated slightly.  I cannot wait to get a good nights rest again.  I'm back on my beta-blocker and somewhat fatigued, but at least I'll be able to sleep again!",5
"I had no idea that my horrible cough was being caused by this med. My MD said if I quit smoking my cough would go away. I'm glad i quit smoking, but the cough is worse than ever. I'll have to get on something different. thanks for the reviews!!!",4
I've been on this medicine for 1 year and have repeatedly been in the hospital for  severechest pains because of this drug. Its helped only little.,1
Have been on this med for over 2 years and it has been great for my blood pressure. It is not pricey and does a wonderful job. I only need the low dose.,5
i guess it has lowered my bp but the cough is horrible i can't stand it anymore it is so embarassing especially when i start gagging from couging so much and i get nausea. I'm going to ask my pcp to give me something else,3
what the doctors dont tell you about this drug is that it does cause a couch that will never go away. It took me a complete year and I still have the couch alittle. it work wonders but the side effects where bad.,4
I WAS RECENTLY HOSPITALIZED FOR MY BLOOD PRESSURE BEING SO HIGH (235/173). AND THE NURSE WHO WAS ASSISTING ME GAVE ME THIS MEDICATION THROUGH THE IV AND WORKED FOR ME INSTANTLY. IT ALSO HELPS ME FROM GOING TO THE BATHROOM OFTEN.,5
"was on beta blockers for years with little or no effect. was told by a cardiologist that ace inhibitors work better in ""people of color""-this seems to be the case.Been on Lisinopril(ace inhibitor)for 5years and have never had better pressure readings 130/70 from 187/90",4
"STARTED TAKING THIS MED BP WAS 150/90 LOWERED BP, BUT SIDE EFFECTS HORRIBLE COUGHING ALL THE TIME/NOSE BLEEDS WITH HUGE CLOTS/STARTED ON DIOVAN BEEN GREAT EVER SINCE!!!",3
"After the first 2 weeks it works very good,no side effects now at all. I take 20 mg a day.",5
Take one dose in the am each day.,5
"coughing, bad coughing, can't sleep because coughing so bad.  Coworkers thought I was terribly sick and wanted to send me home because of cough, had coughs when I couldn't catch my breath, did I say COUGH? I can take anything, just not this!!!",5
For 5 years I was taking the 10mg the dose has recently been upped to 20mg and my BP is stable @ 127/78   Had crept up to  140/90   Works good for me. ,5
"Very bad head aches, chest pain, vision issues, general feeling of blah",3
"Started on clonidine .02, 3 years ago, but it was too short acting, BP kept see-sawing. I started taking Lisinpril Nov. 12, 2008. 20mg, once a day. It keeps my BP at an average 117/75 to 125/83, MUCH BETTER than the clonodine.  Side effects: No coughing but allergic type reaction, area around my sinuses and sensitive upper gums/teeth roots is swelling, a dull numbing feeling. Especially when I inhale. I try to live with it, but sometimes it's very annoying, uncomfortable. I get into depressive moods because of it. I want to ask my doc to let me try another type of drug. ",5
"I started taking lisinopril in August and by Thanksgiving I wound up in the hospital with such severe coughing that my lungs got damaged.  I could not go out in public because I did not know when I would have a coughing fit.  When I quit taking the drug, my lungs got back to normal.  Don't take this drug.",1
I recently stopped drug because of annoying dry cough.,5
"It works on high blood pressure, but I have had noticable HAIR LOSS.",4
hair loss,2
i've been taking it for a while cannot notice any significant changes.,3
This Drug has worked for me unless I am in the Doctors office. Then I get a little tense,3
"This med worked in bringing my pressure down, but it was making my side hurt while I was taking it.  So my pcp put me back on Benicar, which has been keeping my pressure down without the side affects as this med does.",5
"I have been plagued by tiredness, can't sleep, itchy swollen ear canals, dry cough, pounding heart with occasional skipping of beats, and esophageal problems. I had no idea it could be because of this med. Thanks for all yourreviews and I am calling myMD.",4
Lowered my pressure,5
"Med lowered my BP from 160+ down to 130 - 140 level in conjunction with my Doxazosin, but created what apears to be sinus drainage and a cough. Staying cool eases cough and being warm worstens cough. Realy disturbs sleep at night. Stayed off drug for a couple days, sinus drainage stopped and cough cleared up. Will advise Dr. and ask for a change.",4
"I stopped taking lisinopril 10 mg because I had heart palpitations ,then my doc gave me 2.5 mg of amlodipine and am still having palpitations going to see a cardiologist today to make sure there is nothing wrong.I take my bp at home now and it rarely ever goes above 130/80 I think with diet and more weight lose I will be fine without the meds.make sure you ask your doctor about all possible side effects!",3
is good ,3
"So far this medication has worked for me to lower my blood pressure. Be on it about two weeks. The first night I took it, my head felt clogged as if I had a bad head cold and I couldnt hear to well. After that first night things seemed to be okay. I noticed I urinate alot at night, but I am also taking a water pill. I exercise alot and noticed some pudginess around my waist that wasnt there before. Another thing is a loss of sex drive, I just have no interest. I will stay on it, most important is for my blood pressure to stay down. ",5
Experience dry cough and throat irriation with this medication.  I had asked my doctor to change my blood pressure script to a less expensive generic.  Not worth it I am going back on Hyzaar.  Although lisinopril worked on my B.P. it's side effect is very bothersome to me.  My doctor told me that other patients have also reported these symptoms.,4
I WAS PUT ON THIS DRUG WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO. IT HAS WORKED FOR ME SINCE DAY ONE AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO INCREASE THE DOSAGE NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN ON ANY OTHER DRUG FOR HTN.,5
"My bllod presure went down to a god rate, but my limbs (arms and legs) began to feel heavy, don't know if it wad muscle weakness or fatigue.  This after 2 weeks, alittle dizziness, at work and in bed.  Don't know it it caused nose bleeds, but I had them twice.  Today I went to my doctor, I also told her about a cough that I've seemed to have for the past 3 weeks.  Today I got a new medicine prescription for Diovan HCT 12.5-80 mg, let's see what this does.  Did not like this drug at all.",4
"Seems Less effective in lowering blood pressure as usage continues. Blood pressure goes way above the level for which treatment was initiated if you stop taking it. BP was in the 140s when I started  Lisinopril treatment, but became short tempered and experienced ED so I stopped taking it. Within days, BP was over 160 and I started gaining weight so I started taking it again. ",3
"It lowered my blood pressure but made me sick. Heart palpitations, nausea, anxious, loss of appetite. I thought the cure was worse then the ailment. I have started taking 1/2 med. ",5
"Mother was admitted to hospital on 12/31/08 from a severe allergic reaction to Lisinopril which caused swelling of tongue.  I could not believe a human tongue could swell to the magnitude my mother's tongue swelled to.  We were informed while in ER that it would be a possibility she would neet a trach may have to be inserted, but thank God, she did not need one.  Mother was in ICU at local hospital for 13 days and then was moved from ICU to another room in the hospital.  While in ICU mother was not aware of anything and was being assisted by breathing machines and tubes for feeding.  While reading the different reviews, I am amazed at the various reactions this medication causes and yet it has not been pulled from the shelves of pharmacies and medical facilities across the USA. As of this writing she still remains hospitalized with having to eat pureed food because of the tubes inserted in her. I feel the makers of this product needs to know the severity this medication causes and should be held accountable for their actions. We pray that our mother is left with no other illness caused by this medication and recovers fully from it.",3
"Brought down BP, thank Jesus, was very happy. Almost 3 months later I feel like someone else... BUT NOT AT ALL IN A GOOD WAY! I did not read the side effects when starting so not to preconceive anything. I now experience... BLURRED VISION, DRY HACKING COUGH, URINATION DARK FREQUENT & URGENT, INCREASED LOOSE BOWEL MOVEMENTS, LETHARGIC, DEPRESSION, DIZZY, TREMORS/NERVOUSNESS, JOINT/MUSCLE PAIN & NUMBNESS IN LEFT HAND, SLEEPLESSNES, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, FEELS LIKE MY HEART IS POUNDING & FLUTTERING SOMETIMES (ESPECIALLY IN EVE/NIGHT), NAUSEA, BAD TASTE, FULLNESS IN RIGHT EAR, LOWER SEX DRIVE, MY HAIR APPEARS TO BE THINNING AND EVEN A FEW MORE STRANGE THINGS. I know this may seem like someone with a mental issue is writing this, and I've been very reluctant, but if this will help others that's what counts. I have felt like someone very opposite of myself. Thank God I do not drink alcohol, smoke or do drugs. I am a businessman with a wonderful family and have a lot to live for. Yes, my BP did come down, as I feel was a direct result of this drug, but so would cutting off my head. I hope this has been a help. I just do not understand how dangerous drugs get passed thru the FDA. I agree to no testing on animals, but even more so for us humans! Best Regards           ",3
"Effective in lowering BP. Side effects include cough, itching ears, draining sinus, ED, itching on upper body, fatigue/listlessness, frequent urination, and inability to sleep.  Thought I was just getting old until I read comments on this site.",5
I feel much better but an suffering from wild nightmares since taking.  I wake several times a night from some manner of wild almost childlike nightmare that has never burdended me before taking this medication.,3
Had every side effect with no information from doctor or pharmacist.  Almost ran off the Interstate when I almost passed out while drfiving.  Scared me BIG time.  Researched it here and got highly upset I was NOT informed of the major side effects it can cause. BEWARE!!!!,1
"BP still climbs from time to time, but not to stroke level",4
"I have had unsteadiness and feelings of faint- ing or dizzines upon standing which is very reppetitive during the Catholic Mass. The most common thing has been frequent and urgency to urinate which causes nausea that usualy subsides after urination. On some occasions, my nausea requires a half a pill of Promethazine (Pho quiet the Phenergan)  to stop the nausea. I have reduced the dose from a half a pill to a fourth of a pill a day but the nausea continues, I also take Lithium Carbonate, Mirtazepine, and Hydroxyzine for Bipolar Disorder and Panic Attacks/Phobia/PTSD from VietNam and am a 100 % Disabled American Veteran due to some traumatic experiences leading up to a  medical discharge after 13 months with the 3rd Marine Division as A Navy Hospital Corpsman. I am also taking Clonazepam 0.5 mg 3 X a day for severe anxiety. I feel  pretty good for a 70 year old man nonsmoker and non drinker who is concerned abbout the nausea and dizziness.  I stopped taking the HCTC at the doctor's request and wonder if  the lisinopril in such a low dose can be causing the nausea, etc?",2
Works for HBP but within 2 days of taking developed a night time cough that was miserable!!,3
started on 20mg had low sex drive after starting through diet and exrercise have control of HBP dropped to 10mg sex drive improved on 5 mg now dosen't effect it  I take it at night no problems have issue with hearing in left ear feels like blockage any one else have this MD keeps me on it for kidney protection for type 2 diabities,3
I am a 38yr old male and have been on 20mg once a day for nearly a year. Brings bp down slightly but I feel run down alot and have no interest in sex at all. Also my hands and feet are cold alot and sometimes my fingers appear as if they are getting no blood to them at all. They turn yellow and purple. Due to go back to the Dr. in March.,4
"Of course the ideal is to have no side effects, but finding that probably impossible I started taking this drug as a replacement for Diovan which didn't work at all for me.  Lisinopril was prescribed for me at 40mg once a day to start.  My b/p was ranging around 160/100.  Scared to start this drug at such a high dose especially after having bad reactions to Diovan and reading other patient reviews that Lisinopril was derived from snake venom (not true according to my Dr. and pharmacist), I started at 10mg once per day.  No side effects except for a tiny bit of light headedness and feeling inconsistent itchiness.  After 2 weeks at 10mg, I upped the dose to 15mg per day for another 2 weeks.  Now at 20mg once per day and blood pressure down to approx. 125/79 and side effects not any worse (in fact, the ""itchy"" feeling has let up).  I do feel extra tired when getting up in the morning (I take this drug at night), but overall feel a lot better because my blood pressure is dropping.  I've also lost a little weight since being on Lisinopril which is great because I had gained an atrocious appetite while I was on Diovan. I only wish that people that write reviews on drugs would quit exaggerating and imagining side effects that don't really exist and be truthful about their experience.  ",5
Lowered my blood pressure somewhat. Still too high after 6 months useage.,2
"Has worked well in controlling my BP, but the side effects are NOT worth it! I have been on 10mg 1x daily of this drug for 29 days and ever since, my quality of life has suffered. I stay tired, I'm constantly light headed. I'm 38 and have the sex drive of someone twice my age. All of these side effects seemed to happen immediatly after starting this drug. I see my doctor this afternoon for my 1 month checkup and will demand that she change my medication. I felt better when I had high BP! God Bless",5
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll                                It has been easy taking this medicine.  I do not think it is heping.   ,3
"Sore throat and intense coughing, especially at night.  After 7 sleepless nights, am trying Diovan.",3
"I was put on lisinopril in 1992 to help prevent kidney disease, have been type 1 diabetic since 1969.  My kidney function is at 98% and my blood pressure is perfect.  No side effects, I am thrilled with this medication.",5
"Have been on lisinopril 10 mg for two months. Have developed dry hacking cough, dizziness, dry eyes and blured vision. My heart sometimes pounds and it is hard to catch my breath. Feet and hands are always cold. About a week ago I developed severe lower back pain. Now hips are hurting and almost feels like I have bad cramps. I am going to another doctor and getting this medication changed. I did lower my BP significantly.",5
"I almost died as a result od lisinopril,I had the most terrible reaction you could imagine I developed angioedema! Thanks to God I stop on time. Doctors knows of this reaction but they refused to tell their patients, PLEASE POST IT AS A WARNING!!",1
5 mg. worked well for me. 10 mg. gave me e.d. ang a dry cough. ,4
it makes me feel dizzy and wild dreams and headaches,3
"Controls high blood pressure,and reduces possible heart attacks or strokes.",5
Just started taking Lisinopril 10 mg today. Would like to hear from others that have been taking it longer.,1
first week on this medicine i gained twelve pounds.  had to eat before taking it and once takin it would knock me out and the whole day i would be groggy and tired.  needless to say that i am no longer on this medicine.,4
A couple days after taking this med I broke out with hives covering my entire body. I took benedryl for the itching and it made me sick. Is this med at all related to the Sulfa drug family?,1
"I am HIV POZ take this drug for  kidney problems not any more swelling of face  and hands pins and needles all over,burning sensation , on face and hard time swallowing food, like a bubble stuck mid chest and food would get stuck and hard to swallow. so i am off this drug for good reardless of what my dr says  ",1
At first I was taking this medication during the night and it did not work.  I had to go to the hospital because during the night my blood pressure was still going up.  What the doctor recommended was to take it during the morning and 80 mg.  Now the medication is working.,4
I'm not dead yet.,3
"I have been using lisinopril for 8 months now and never heard of any side effets!I had a dry hacking cough for the first three months and was sleepy all the time not tired,the cough went away but now all heck's broken loose,I have no energy I can't get out of bed some days I am only 35 years old and feel like i'm sixty,I am stopping the medication today for the following reasons,tired all of the time ,I have dizzy spelles ,my ears ring constantly , I have sharp pains in my head , my heart pounds in my chest like I have run a marathon while sitting still , heart palpitations , and some sings of vertigo,at first everything was great so please keep a close watch on yourself and any changes talk to your doc ,I'm gonna see mine on monday!I will let you all know what has happened.",3
"I have been taking this med. for a month and have developed a dry hacking caugh that keeps me from sleeping.  Also, lowered sex drive, esophgus issues and dizzyness.  The med. has reduced my bp to 130/83 from 155/95.  I'm goinb to the MD on Monday to ask for a change.",4
I believe that this has helped me but I have had some hair loss. But the hair did come back. The back of my head near the cente3r had a bald spot bu it is back. Stress which is gone may have been a factor.,3
"After a heart attack at age 57, my Dr. put me on lisinopril. I was on it exactly 3 weeks, when I felt like I had stood in a pile of fire ants. My feet itched, then my hands itched and  swelled. I took Benadryl to ease the itching. The next day I developed raised, red welts in my groin and a cough. Also sinus congestion. I called my Dr--he said to stop the drug, now! Later the same day it felt like I was having another heart attack---pressure in chest, short of breath, so I went to the ER. It was not heart related. I am allergic to the drug. It's been a LONG week since I stopped the drug and I still feel like crap. Itching, and GERD symptoms persist. The Dr. said it will take 7-10 days to get the drug out of my system---meanwhile I'm on Benadryl every 4-6 hrs.  After reading many of these comments, this drug should be outlawed!!!!!",1
"I took Lisinopril for 7 days only.  After 3 or 4 days, I had discomfort in my left arm and wrist almost constantly and periodic pain at night.  Developed a small rash on left forearm and then it turned into something that looked like a bruise.  Had no energy.  Stopped taking it after 7 days but side effects continued to get worse for next 4 days.  Frequent urination - one night had to get up 6 times.  After being off medicine for a week, starting to feel normal again.  Left arm still has some discomfort but no periodic pain at night and no more frequent urination.  This medicine is not for me  ",1
"My high bp is caused by kidney disease, stage 3. I take 2.5mg, lowest dose and have ringing in ears, dry and wet cough 24/7, hot flashes(menopause), frequent nose bleeds, tingling feet, but Dr. says this med. will help to slow down kidney disfunction as well as lower bp. A low sodium diet is necessary for anyone with hbp, but is so hard to do. Our processed food is full of types sodium, not just salt.Dining out is a hassle. Now I hear daughter has kidney disease, it runs in families, have yours checked, it could be in yours.",3
Just started using this drug after being diagnosed w/hbp...Now i'm reading about hair loss..whats up w/that? My hair is already thin and fine. Will I lose it in clumps?,3
I  developed a cough and esophagus problems after taking this drug.  i have not gotten rid of the cough and wondered if it would ever go away.,1
Developed severe cough which would continue until I would finally vomit.  Couldn't keep food down while taking this drug.  Changed to Micardis; only slight cough w/Micardis.,5
"I have headaches every day which I also experienced with hydrochlorothiazide.  It is a piercing left temple headache.  I also have a dry cough, which I thought may be sinuses but now after reading these reviews, I think it is the Lisinipril. I think I will stop taking it and see what happens with the headache and cough.",4
"I am a 57 y/o female over weight about 50 lbs. I take otc meds, 1 aspirin, 1 Prilosec, 1 Fish Oil, and 2 Tylenol PM for sleep, thats all that I take. I went to the Dr today for Strep Throat, no fever, bp was elevated 154/84, My blood work that I had previouly had was all great and in normal range except chlorestol was a little over 200 , she wanted to put me on this Medication she said it had low side effects, but after reading about 125 comments of bad cough, hair loss,loweing bp to an unsafe level,insomnia, weight gain, sores on your lips, I think I'll just lose some weight and chose not to take the Meds. There was just to many cons and not enough pros about the side effects. Thanks for your info, this should be able to get back to the drs, when they have more time to spend w/you, then rush you in and out oh she did give me a Rx for my Strep Throat that I will take. Where has the Drs gone that used to care for you and your health surely that are getting paid enough for there services.   ",1
"I take 2 meds (vitamins too).  Lisinopril and tricor.  I CANNOT sleep.  Legs twitch at bottom, go numb at top.  If I manage to take a nap because of lack of sleep at nite, I wake with heart pounding so hard it's unbelievable.  Slight bouts of depression.  It's hard to know which is the culprit tricor or lisinopril.  Have horrible cough too.  I'm thankful for this website.  Dr. recommended it.  From all the comments it seems we're all guinea pigs and even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while (it may work for one thing, but cause something worse). I feel like throwing all prescribed meds in garbage and taking my chances with what God has given me.",2
My hubby has been on a small doz but has developed severe headaches has anyone else had this issue on this? Please help they are so bad that he said it is like his head is going to explode! ,3
i was happy with this drug for the most part,3
I'm taking 40 mg. and my pressure has decreased to a borderline range. I am concerned with a possible side effect of thinning of my hair and lack of body texture of my hair ,2
I felt really well after taking the first few days of this medicine with visible side affects.,5
I was on this medication for over 6 mo. when I complained to my dr. that I had a very dry cough and ringing in my ears. She said that it was probably allergies. I never had an allergy in my life. I also became very dizzy while turning in my sleep. My dr. gave me pills for vertigo. I was getting ready for hip replacement surgery when my dr. said that my potassium levels were very high (6) and I should stop eating bananas or she won't clear me for surgery. I don't eat bananas. Did my own research told her that the lisinopril was causing all my symptoms and she finally switched me to atenolol and had the surgery. Thought I had a very good dr. from UCLA with honors and I had to diagnose myself!,4
"I had a very bad experience after the use of Fleet Phosphosoda as a bowel prep for a Colonoscopy. If you are age 55 or over, please read the FDA report on the use of Lisinopril and this bowel prep. You don't hear any of this from the doctor w/ ""the one size fits all prep"".I can no longer take Lisinopril.",4
"Side effects, numerous, dry cough, itchy eyes, dehydration feeling and tired feeling.",5
"I began taking this medication in August 2008 at the lowest dosage. It was fine I had no problems and no side effects. But I recently went back to the doctor because I thought I was retaining water and he increased the dosage. It has been a little over a week since he increased my dosage and I have started out being really lethargic (which I knew was a side effect).  Then i became light headed at times.  Now a week and a half after the new dosage I have this horrible cough that I can't seem to get rid of.  I've been taking the normal allergy medicines that usually work for me, but this cough is consistent--dry at times and other times it is full of mucus.  I can't sleep because I'm coughing, I can't have a conversation with someone because I'm coughing.  After reading everyone else's posts, it falls in line with the same symptoms.  Definitely calling the doctor on Monday for a new prescription or will find a new doctor. Besides, BP is still high.",3
Brought my BP down from 175/110 to 125/83 in two weeks. Amazing? Also keeps my me coughing like I have the whooping cough - day and night. Nothing seems to help relieve it for more than a minute or two. Went off drug after three weeks of hell; now on Amlodipine (Calcium chnnel blocker) - but I am still coughing almost one week after ceasing Lisinopril. I understand the cough can linger on for weeks. I think it's best to exercise and diet to get to a healthy weight if your high BP is affected by your diet & weight. At least one might be able to reduce their dosage a bit.,4
"The first day that I took Lisinopril I had no side effects and my blood pressure was down, but the next day I was dizzy and my heart was racing and my pulse was over 100. The second day I still have racing heart/pulse. I called my doctor to put me back on my old medicine.  I found that It doesn't mix well with celebrex.  I also have the cough, but I didn't know that it was from this and the sinus.  I will not take this medicine anymore.",1
frequent headaches -  swelling and rapid weight gain over 20 pounds in 3 months,3
"I have another view of this drugs on this site under the same name,blood pressure is still not under control. Now I have a trach tube that helps me to  breath, and all this happen because i took this drug,must keep in 3or4 month still don't know if i will get my voice back,without speaking with a tube down my throat, so be very careful when taking this drug, I am just one of the lucky ones who lived to tell the story about this drug life is ruin. No job can't get help when you do must waiting until you are almost dead to get it. Big companies make money on your behalf make them pay when a drug they put on market almost kills someone or does kill someone. Let it be your family member and i bet you would want the drug companies to do something about this drug. This happen to me on 8/22/2008 5 hrs later in er,20 later in ICU on ventilator for 5 day  put to sleep so body could go down, face,throat, eyes,lips,entire body swollen,now i am very careful about any drug that i take.Today date is 12/23/2008 no christmas for me ,but happy to be alive,with my breathing tube,must keep suction machine, and breathing machine to keep throat from getting dry,my cough is still here just not as much.FDA check yourself and the drugs that you put on the market.thanks",1

I have been on 40 mg for over 2 years and to date I am lethargic, tired all the time, memory is not as good, hands go numb, dizziness all the time, I cannot feel my toes, my feet feel like pins and needles sticking in them all the time when resting, doc says it is arthritis but I know better, had a bacterial infection in gland under my chin which swelled to the size of a golf ball and caused a type of blister to form on in the corner of my upper lip which resulted in a huge scar after 3 weeks and a bunch of cipro. Doc acts like he doesn't know what is going on. Maybe it's not an act. I am changing both the meds and the doc. Taking no more of this trash. I am glad to have found this site! his is my 3rd BP doc. What are we going to do? Being a doctor means money not healing. There are very few true healers in this world and a butt load of doctors. ",2
i have just started this medication,3
Have had dizzy spells. Also i have had a cough that will not go away. Sometimes i cough so hard i feel like i will pass out. I do not care for this medication.,2
Been on this drug for over 2 years.  Dr wasn't pleased with bp reading.  Doubled my dosage and I have from time to time a racing heart feeling like it is going to jump out of my chest and I feel very shaky at times.  Always tired and aches and pains.  Anyone else with these problems?,2
blood pressure drops to low,3
"I developed a severe ongoing headache, cardiac dysrhythmia, severe fatigue. MD switched me to a beta blocker now..so we'll see how that works",2
This drug worked on my high blood pressure but it has alot of side effects and it is made from snake venom. It is suppose to be one of the safer drugs but the snake venom thing scared me to death.,5
"took drug for 15+ yrs after starting with zestril and insurance kept dropping to generics ending up with lisinopril,did not recogonize side effects unyil 3weeks ago had swollen upper lip which my mother developed with same drug,am off now but had thinning of hair this year plus aches of neck and knee over last year  and also ear noise,fatigue also but when one gets over 50 you start to blame age not meds. will closely watch any new meds in future!!",3

"My blood pressure was just barely in the borderline category.  However, I have a family history.  Nonetheless, I have developed a very aggravating, scratchy throat that results in dry coughing which also disturbs my sleep.  Now own shares in cough drop companies...",3
Been taking this medication for close to 2 years. High Blood Pressure has been completelly controlled.,5
I haven't been on this drug long enough. I have been on this drug 2 days,1
"This medication gave me a dry, hacking cough that disrupted my sleep and work for weeks until I stopped using it under my doctor's instruction.",1

"Been taking this med since the end of october 2008.  Has worked well to keep my BP in check.  However, the coughing all the time is nuts!  I use cough-drops and throat losenges, and this seems to help most of the time.  Especially at night.  I do feel fatigued alot, but this could also be from a combination of other problems and meds I have.  I have had no other side effects, and this med is working well for me so far.",5
I've developed a dry cough since being on this drug.,5
"I had the commonly-described cough, plus very weird blistering on the palms of my hands and palm-side of my fingers, after which my skin started seriously peeling. Doctor changed prescription to Cozaar 50 mg and no problems.",1
"Works great to lower blood pressure, but get a gagging sensation for a few moments every day although it only lasts for about 0-15 seconds, it is annoying.",4
"I am a 34 year old diabetic with low blood pressure and generally good health. I started taking this drug 1 month ago because my doc said this would help protect my kidneys. The first 2 weeks I had horrible headaches, but those have stopped. Now I am experiencing abnormal numbness and poor circulation in my arms and legs. Has anyone else experienced this?",1
"Have not noticed many side effects, but, after taking it a month or two, I had a blood test for my cholesteral, and my liver was slightly elevated, so I was put on Omega 3 for the cholesteral, instead of a drug. Now, a year later, when I went in for a blood test for my thyroid, they also checked my liver count, and it has gone sky high, way over what it should be. So now I have to find out if the lisinopral is what is causing it. And I believe it is. Has anyone else had this problem?",4
"I took this as a preventive measure for diabetes as its supposed to be good for the kidneys.  Additionally, I was starting to get borderline HBP.  I had to stop when a got a NASTY cough.  It was unrelentless.",3
I started taking lisnopril about a year ago and had some serious side effects.  The main problem was the dry cough and heaving that I developed.  At night I could not sleep without having a glass of water by my bedside.  During my normal work hours I couldn't hold a conversation without a hard piece of candy.  The condition got worse until I changed doctor's and medication.  Now that I don't take lisnopril there is no more dry cough and heaving.  My advice get another medication before that one kills you.,1
"I have been on Lisinopril, 5 mgs., for nearly a year now. I did have some dizzyness, headaches, and sinus pressure but recently developed ""burning mouth syndrome,"" which is sometimes caused by Ace Inhibitors, which this drug is. I experimented to see if getting off the medication helped with this, and it did. The first time I tried even half a pill, it came back immediately. I was lucky to have read about this side effect as I did not know what was causing it for a couple of months. I did like that the drug is one of the $4 drugs around town. I am being put now on Norvasc with no health insurance, and I understand it is pricey. I am very sensitive to medications with lots of drug allergies so I hate taking any kind of medication. ",4
"I've only been on this med for 4 days.  Dropped my BP from 150/105 to 117/78.  My BP has gone as low as 96/74 on this stuff.  I feel very lethargic, hard to get motivated to do anything but sleep.  Aches and pains on my left side particularly in my hand, leg, hip and collarbone.  A little bit of nausea and funny taste in my mouth.  No cough, but my sinuses are acting like I have a head cold (thick yellow mucus).  I am taking 10mg a day.  I think maybe 5mg would help - will ask Dr. to drop dosage or maybe I'll just chop my pills!",5
"took this med for 6 years, brought my bp down but recently had a bacteria infection in upper lip and it caused my whole lip to swell, er doc thought it was mostly this drug that was causing it. he said he treats about 5 cases like mine a month and i was took off it immediately.",3
possibly causing itching upper body skin,3
"This medication keeps my blood pressure down.  However, I have developed a ""dry cough"", especially at night.  The worst is joint pain....I feel every day that I have been hit by a truck!!! I will ask my doctor to try a different medication.  I actually feel that I have a joint or bone disease!",3
"I was put on this med by a wonderful renal doc at a pediatric hospital. It has worked beautifully for me. Only big problem is the no babies part. We haven't found another med that works as well, so as of right now, it's too dangerous to take me off this one, and I have no children...",5

"I have ben taking Lisinopril in a low dosage for the past 6 years. After some dental work about 1 month ago, my BP was elevated. My doctor doubled the dosage. Sine then, I am experiencing dry mouth every night. Since reading some comments about the causes of dry mouth, I am going to speak to my doctor.",5
I've been using Lisinopril for over 2 years.  It brought my BP down from the High 130s over High 80s to Low 120s over low 70s.  No known side effects for me.,5
"My doctor prescribed this medicine for me over three weeks ago.  Two weeks later, I noticed that my mouth was very dry at night and I had a terrible yeast infection for a little over a week.

"When taken in the early morning,Lisinapril seems to control my high blood pressure during the day. However, my blood pressure tends to rise again around 5 pm. ",3
I started this drug recently and never got to see if it lowered my BP because the side-effects were so bad.  After 3 days taking the pills I experienced extreme bloated feelings with gas and abdominal pain. It lasted for 3 days in which time I didn't take the pills. I was also nauseated and couldn't swallow them.  Symptoms then resolved and I thought it was a stomach flu. I then started to take the Lisinopril again and after 2 more days became sick with the same severe stomach cramps with gas and this time vomiting. I immediately stopped and got better after a day or so.  I am now going to try something else.  Apparently my side effects only affect 2% of those taking it..Lucky me...=),1

"I just wanted to let everyone know that this medication is not worth the side effects. From the very first day I took this medicine I have had problems from shortness of breath, dizziness, to fatigue and a dry mouth with a hacking cough all day and night. I read the side effects that came with the pills and when I started experiencing several of them I went back to the doctor and she changed me to a different medicine and I still cough.

After 10 days or so I started feeling a lot better.  I will never ever take lisinopril again.  EVER!",5

"This medication, used for elevated blood pressure, did help the stubborn blood pressure when used with atenalol and hctz.

I take my blood pressure at least three times a week and I have a record of the readings.  I had taken my blood pressure about an hour before I started having problems.

I called and asked my doctor if this was a side effect of this drug and she then admitted that it was!  She then switched me to a new drug, I  switched doctors.  I also gained weight and had water retention problems, esp. in my thighs.  I can't believe that some doctors would not warn their patients about these side effects.  My legs are still heavy and feel detached from the rest of my body, even though I am now taking a water pill. Please, be careful. ",5

I couldn't sleep and was driving my family & co-workers crazy.   Luckily my Dr. had warned me and I quickly got off the meds. It still took several weeks for the cough to subside.  Personally I am horrified at how many have left feedback that their Drs didn't warn them of the side effect and lived with it not knowing the cause.  Shame on the Drs! ",5

My MD has me returning in 30 days for blood work. My potassium is 1 point high and I see that is one of the conditions that you should not take the drug. Maybe that is part of the reason for more blood work. The star rating system does not allow me to rate as a beginner.  Wish me luck.",1

"I've been on 10mg of lisinopril for about two months now, and I think this is a miracle drug.  My BP went from 170/110 to 120/75 since I've been taking it. I understand that other people here have had side effects, but I haven't had ANY side effects, other than getting a little light-headed if I allow myself to get dehydrated.  As long as I pay attention to my fluid intake, this drug has been perfect for me.  (Plus? It's super cheap, and since I have the horrible insurance of the self-employed, that's important to me.)",5
I've been taking Lisinopril for a little over 4 years.  Blood Pressure is now about 106/60.  Started out with congestive heart failure with atril fibrilation and elevated blood pressure.  Now down to just the lisinopril in conjunction with lipitor for colesterol.  Some dry mouth in morning but no particular problems.  Anticipate being on this drug for quite some time.    Dosage was initially increased in small steps.  Talked to doctor about taking the 5mg dosage and cutting in half to take in morning and evening.  He increased dosage with desire to get me to 20mg per day but I could not tolerate all at once.  He OK'd cutting the pills up and get it done over a period of about 4 months.  Now taking 10mg in morning and 10 mg in evening.    Talk to your doctor about gradual increases over time.  IT worked for me.  Started at age 58 and now age 62,5

However, I too experience the coughing and clearing of the throat side effect described by other users. Until looking into the side effects and reviews listed on this site, I was unaware of this side effect. I had assumed, because of the season, that it was allergy related. It's to the point that it's effecting my sleep. I have a horrible breathing pattern, experience snoring and the dry hacking cough at all hours of the night. ",4

I have been on this drug for @ 6 months and bp is good; however the dry cough is killing me.  I, like many of the others, though it was allergies maybe, or then the thought of something much worse.  However, I was relieved to read that this is a common side effect for many others.  I will probably try to change to something else when I see my doc next month.

I didn't know what the side effects were until I went to my Dr.with a horrible dry cough that had me to the point of gagging and almost vomiting. My kids begged me to see the Dr because I was waking them up at night coughing and gagging.People didn't want to be around me because they thought I was very sick. I told the Dr that I felt fine except for the barking cough.He said I'm sorry that's my fault , it's probably the Lisinopril. I also have the bad headaches in the morning like some other reviewers mentioned. I thougt it was my allergies or my damp foundation of my house. Glad my Dr changed my medication.",4
I have taken this med. for a few months.  Kept getting sinus and severe coughing that would keep me up @ night. I even tried to take it @ night but the coughing was persistent all thru the day and night.,4

"I started this medication three months ago & already had a chronic cough but this medication made it worse.  I cough constantly to the point of gagging.  I hate to go out anywhere or be in a crowd.  I really worked on my blood pressure, though.  I had to go for chest exrays twice to see if I had something in my lungs causing the cough.  The doctor put me on Zyrtec but that didn't help the cough at all.  She told me to stop taking Lisinopril for two weeks and see what happens.  I stopped yesterday but am still coughing so I guess it takes a few days to get out of your system.  Hope there's a replacement because it really took my blood pressure down.",5

It did not occur to me until another lady asked me if I was taking Lisinopril--that she had taken it and coughed all the time!  Thanks to her, I talked to my doctor and he changed my medication.  What a miserable time I spent on this med.  Hats off to the lady who brought this to my attention---I thought maybe I had some other major health issues the way I coughed.  After being off the medication for a few days the coughing ceased!",3
After taking this drug for three months my mother's tongue swelled up so huge that it blocked her airway.  She was rushed to the hospital and put on a ventilator.

"I have been taking this med. (10mg) for a little over a month now and I have that dry cough and fatigue that everyone is talking about. The answers for me was to take it at night, drink plentyof water and use a humidifier. I first, starting drinking a lot of water with the med., then that didnt work but when I added the humid. and taking it at night it work out the best. I get plenty of sleep and the cough is gone. It seems to make your throat dry and I'm assuming that's why the cough started in the first place. I feel good otherwise am very greatful to have anything to help lower my BP and help my health. So to prevent all of it from starting every night I plug up the humidifier an hour before bed along with the med. so when the meds. kick in I'm prepared and ready for a goodnight sleep and ""GOOD"" it is.

"Dr. started me on 10mg of Lisinopril and I had terrible headaches.  I also had mild muscle aches, blurred vision and dry coughing spells that I wrongly attributed to a cold or allergy but my doctor says this is a common side effect when the dosage is too high and he immediately lowered dosage to 5mg and sure enough most of the above symptoms went away.  I also started an exercise program for seniors and in less than 10 months BP now averages 115/75.   ",4

Why can't I continue taking Lisinopril at a higher dose?  I don't want to start all over again trying to find out what dose is right for me or fearing to take this medication based on the side effects which really freaks me out.  Is changing my medication really necessary or it's their way of promoting a  product?",5

Before starting Lisinopril, my Dr. had me on Toprol XL which made me very tired and I was almost falling asleep in school.  Then I was put on another medication that gave me a bad cough.

can lisinopril cause headaches if taken in high doses?,3
"I have been on Lisinopril 10mg every morning for about one month.  Just recently got a refill for another month supply.  Noticed generalized itching over all my body and tingling sensation around my lips.  Feels like ants crawling over my body!  Did not connect symptoms with Lisinopril until today and reading the previous posts from others who have experienced similar symptoms. Also having muscle aches, leg cramps etc.  Called my insurance company and spoke with a nurse -- sounds like a typical allergic reaction -- why it did not surface and become more severe prior to this is a mystery to me, but I know I won't be taking any more of this medication or any other ACE inhibitor!  The itching is horrific!",3
"Was taking Coreg for elevated BP and because I had a stroke in a vein in my eye, but it wasn't lowering it enough-then added 10mg of Lisinoprol daily, which helped. My blood pressure was around 145 /90 with a pulse of 80-83.  In retrospect, I should have known something was wrong, but I have such bad airborn allergies that it didn't occur to me that the horrible coughing spells could be caused by something else. And, all I want to do is sleep. The headaches were so random that I thought it was because of my allergies.  We even bought two large room air cleaners for our bedroom and living room!  The urine leakage has been a nightmare,but I thought it was because of my age--my gynocologist suggested exercises to strengthen my abdominal muscles! Getting to sleep is hard and then the coughing wakes me up--so I thought that was what was causing me to feel tired all of the time. Lack of sleep. Because of an accident, I have been having physical therapy--and got seriously winded after only 6 minutes on the stationary bike.  If I bend over for too long I get so nauseated that I have to sit for awhile 'til it passes.  Today was my three months check-up with my Dr.and told him how I felt and that I had a cough that I couldn't shake, a weight on my chest, lethargy and that I felt overall terrible. That my mouth gets so dry at night, that I wake up gagging, if I'm not coughing! He stopped the lisenoprol--and I finally looked it up when I got home and found this site. I am in shock! I should have read the material more thoroughly when I first got the prescription. This is a lesson I won't have to learn twice! I have also had another stroke in my eye a week ago!  My doctor feels badly but all I want is to feel like my old self, the sooner the better. I am only 15 pounds overweight and 65 years old--but I feel 100 right now and depressed.  ",3

I also found a new Dr. Did not need anything for HTN for several years. Started back on Lisinopril this year. Cough returned and my current Dr told me that this is not a symptom that goes away, so we switched to another drug. I even had family & co-workers asking me to do something about my cough!  ",2

I was surprised that using this medication and losing 30lbs after 13 months was enough to bring my BP to normal.  At first I had muscle cramps in legs, feet & hands and some blurred vision, but after adding 45 minutes of walking and 15 minutes of stretching 4 days/wk most of the problems are at a tolerable level, and I feel much more energetic too.  During the rainy season, I check out exercise DVD’s for “Baby Boomers” from the library to keep up my exercise regimen.     Dr. says if I lose another 20lbs he can lower the dosage which is incentive enough for me to add a modest diet to my regimen I haven't felt this good in years...",4

"Please bare with me as I make my case about Lisinoprol>>>Five days ago my doctor represcribed Lisinoprol and increased my dosage to 20 mg. He also changed an anxiety medication to Xanax XR. My doctor suggestted I lose a few pounds so, I started following a strict diet, exercising, gardening, etc. After 5 days, I've GAINED 5 POUNDS. I was sick of looking at my weight increase (despite my efforts), so I started doing research on all the prescribed meds I'm taking. I started with the anxiety med. While taking regular Xanax (which is addictive, but I have peace in my life again), I didn't gain any additional weight. I started reflecting on my time gardening today. After about an hour of gardening, my legs were so weak I could bare stand up, I felt lightheaded, my body was weak and my ankles were swollen.  When searching for the side effects of Lisinoprol, I was so disturbed. I was experiencing up to five symptoms at any given time. Also, I've been leaking urine without a full bladder and/or not having to go to the bathroom. My blood pressure has been elevated for over 10 years, but my doctor have some explaining to do. The side effects of this drug are serious and may have caused me to begin having anxiety attacks; I began having them about 2 - 3 years ago around the same time my doctor first began prescribing this med. I'm learning to question my doctor not only about the benefits of a drug, but also the possible side effects. Doctor's make mistakes. There was a serious mistake in my medical records in which he had to write an addendum for. I DO NOT recommend this drug.",1
I Started taking medication 5 days ago,3
"I was using Diovan & went into respiratory distress (also swelling of lips, face, neck & throat) and was then switched to 2-3 other drugs and now finally to Lisinopril 10mg for about a year.  Initially I had coughing during the day and night (not to the extreme where it kept me awake at night), but enough that I thought I had an allergy or common cold etc. and then after reading the information on this site I found that coughing is a common symptom with this drug.  I also had some muscle cramps in my feet and hands and some headaches too, but after including an hour of combined aerobics and stretching exercises 3-4 days/wk most of the symptoms have been reduced to the occasional headaches.  In a year’s time, I have lost about 35lbs, blood pressure & cholesterol levels are normal, and my doctor has recently lowered my dosage from 10 to 5mg.  ",4
"This med. gave me such a horrible cough, that I couldn't sleep, would gag and just about throw up.  Plus, the runny nose, sore throat and chest congestion.  Thought it was allergies at first, but I have never had allergies this bad.  Finally, remembered my husband tried to take this drug a few years back and it did him the same.  Wish I would of put two and two together sooner.  This has been a horrible experience!",4
"This drug nearly killed me.  Upon my very first dose - one pill - I went into anaphalytic shock and ended up in the chronic care unit for 9 days.  I was hospitalized for 2 weeks total.  My thoat and tongue were so swollen that my mouth could not contain my tongue.  I could not breathe and I was intubated to assist me.  Additionally, my stomach was pumped and I had to have a blood transfusion during my stay in the hospital.  It turned out that because I have lupus that I should never have been prescribed this medicine because it contains ACE inhibitors.",1

"I've used this medication for about a year. At first I was on 10 mg. Then 20 mg, now 30 mg a day. Now it has lowered my blood pressure but after reading about others problems, I'm wondering if some of my other problems may have been caused by this medication. A year ago I had pains in my chest and had tests done including an angiogram. Showed some blockage and 1 leaky valve. Since than, I now have 3 leaky vales and heart rate was so low I had to have a pacemaker put in. I'm 54 years old and thought I was in basically good health. As far a Lisinopril, I had usual cough from it, started snoring, jaw cracking, irregular heart beats, depression that worsened with increased dosage and foot and leg cramping. Now I don't know how much Lisinopril had to do with that, however I cut back to 20 mg. and I'm starting to feel better. Now I will cut back to 10 mg. and then I'm going to get another medication.",3
"The first year I had mild symptoms of coughing, headaches and blurry vision.  Now In my second year, I still have the same symptoms, but only occasionally.  I now include walking exercises 4 days/week at 45 minutes and my blood pressure is now normal.  I am hoping in future that my doctor takes me totally off medication for good.  ",4
"Lisinopril is the only drug I take presently. Have had blood pressure issues for over 10 years and tried different medications. This works fine for me after suffering a mini stroke. No side effects. Adjusted very well. Acutally, Benicar was the best but couldn't afford the expense. Weight low, eat healthy, cholestral extemely low, don't smoke, etc. Just the blood pressure and varicose veins. Genes I guess.",5

"“BW” again (see previous review).  I live in Los Angeles, CA and my 10mg Lisinopril is one of the $4 discounted drugs on the Wal-Mart & Target pharmacy list.  However, starting May 2008 Wal-Mart implemented the program whereby the customer can obtain a 90 day supply for $10.   Target is closer to me so I asked Target pharmacy would they “match” Wal-Mart’s offer and they accepted.   I now pay $10 for a 90 day supply of Lisinopril 10 mg which averages $3.33 per month.   ",4
"I don't know if this drug has caused my eye sight to deteriorate since taking it, or if it is caused by something else, but my ey-sight has definately deteriorated. I alsostopped taking thenm for five days to check if there would be an improvement in my ED problem, but there wasn't, so it is not the Lisinopril but obviously the taking of other BP tablets for the last 20 years.",4
"I am taking 10 mg once per day.  The only side effect I had was mild to modest headaches and mild vision blurring.  In an effort to reduce the headaches, I split the pill and took twice per day for about 6 months but my blood pressure lowered only a little.  But once my body became accustomed to the medicine, I can now tolerate taking it once a day per the doctor’s orders.  I am now on a modest diet plus 60 minutes of exercise 4 days per week, and the combination of all three is bringing my blood pressure down at a more modest pace.   ",4
Satisfied,3
I started having problems with my feet.  When standing or walking it felt like I had sea shells under my skin. Around the arch area hurt most.

However, last night, I had a dream about not being able to get my breath, and woke up feeling that I had stopped breathing. I was gasping for air. I also noticed that my neck was swollen.

I live in Michigan and recenly (12/07) started on generic lisinopril 10 mg from Meijer's (blue gray pill) manufactured by Watson LA with no side effects. Spent Jan 08 - Mar 08 in Florida and switched to Walgreen's lisinopril (pink pill) manufactured by Lupin.  Immediately within 1 week after beginning Walgreen's lisinopril experienced dry cough.  Upon returning to Michigan and switching back to Meijer's lisinopril dry cough stopped within 1 week. My recent visit to my doctor confirmed that lisinopril has lowered my BP and is working and I continue at 10 mg dossage. I talked with the Pharmacists at both Walgreens and Meijer's and neither could explain why one had dry cough side effect and the other did not.  The only difference is the pill color and manufacturer.,4

"I usually have 140/80 bp after taking drug, i would vary from 130/80 to 116/62 which was fine. I feel more calm. the dry cough comes and goes usually at night. My libido is unaffected, still very high at 46yrs. I also changed my diet and excercise to 5 days a week with at least 72 oz of liquid/ water tea etc...lost 30 lbs. BP is fine very satisfied",4
"Took 5mg once a day for a week. Never again! It increased my blood pressure to well over 200/100, had shortness of breath and was tired most of the time. Went back to Altenol-Chlor 100/25mg 2x a day and was fine. Sometimes it doesnt pay to listen to your doctor when they want to try something new....",1

bp went too low,3
I have been taking this medication for almost 2 years and I have a very bad cough  I know this medication's side effect is a cough. Could I still have a side effect of the cough after 2 years??,3
"Immediate good results.However developed cough after 1 mth usage. Cough continued and worsened. Developed nasal issues and treated. After 7 months on Lisinopril urination increased dramatically. Sever dry cough increased causing sleep problems. Tightness in neck, shoulders and throat. BP has decreased dramatically and stayed. Dr is now switching me to Benicar to hopefully eliminate cough.",4

"I  have been Lisinopril for 2 mons. and have all the side effects listed for this drug, plus some. I'm on a low dose of 10mg, but it's really messing me up. First I couldn't sleep, but now I can't get enough sleep and am so fatigued during the day, major non-stop diarrhea, cough, pounding/racing heartbeat,stomach pains/cramps, painful joints, sore all over, sore tongue, then as of 2 days ago my tongue has a thick black coating on it. GROSS!! My Dr. had put me on Flagyl for the diarrhea, thinking I had an intestinal bacterial bug, but it made me completely stop for days. I stopped taking it for a day and later (literally) the water was back on. But, after seeing that that is one of the side effects, I'm stopping it and am now waiting to get in to see my Dr. I've never felt so aweful! ",3
After being on this medication I have had a very dry cough. I was first treated with other medication it did not help. They have finally but me on a different medication. My doctor feels that this med has caused the cough. It was very bad at night causing me to get no sleep. If you start with a cough get off the meds.,4
I have taken this drug for 10 yrs and have not had any problems with it. ,5
great for controlling BP but negative for my libido-thought it was my advanced age but see that others on your website reporting same problem-will be discussing an alternate medication with my physician soon!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"This is a follow up to a previous rating I gave where I described my severe coughingas a result of taking lisinopri. This condition went on for over a month and has now subsided.  The doctor gave me allergy meications but apparently I never took them long enough.  She said you have to keep with it for a long time, maybe over a week to get relief.  So for those of you still afflicted by the cough try staying with some of the allergy meds.  For those of you who think you might have the coughing side effect be aware they last a long time.  I stopped taking lisinopril for three days thinking the coughing would stop and it didn't, so I resumed the dosage.  If you have that itchy throat you should probably stop right away.  ",1

Libido is non-existant. I will not take this medication any longer. This drug needs much more study in my opinion.  My blood pressure has actually increased from a steady 190 over 110 to 222 over 112 as of today. Will be contacting my Doctor today.",1
"I have noticed a decrease in my libido and E.D., WHILE EVEN TAKING LEVITRA",4

"My doctor told me that weight gain was not a side effect.  However, I have gained 6 pounds in 4 weeks.  I work out 45 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week.  A friend told me she gained 10 pounds on drug.  If you research this drug, you will see that weight gain is a side effect.  My blood pressure was not very high anyway so I am not going to take this pill anymore.",4

There was no mention of the percentage of people who experience the cough which is anywhere from 3 to 11 percent depending on where you get the info.  My cough got worse and worse.  I couldn't sleep.  I stopped for three days but the cough persisted.  I now know you have to wait on an average of 14 days.  Not only did I have the cough and what I thought was a virus but I had a soreness at the back of my tongue and felt very tired.  I have not taken lisinopril for 10 days and the symptoms persist.  I am hoping they will go away soon.  I have lost sleep and gotten generally ""run down"".  Pay attention to the side effects when you buy drugs even if you have never had a problem before like me.

My wife was taking lisinopril for high blood pressure.  She developed a cough in Dec 07 which continued to get worse. It got so bad she couldn't sleep and ended up on the couch to let me sllep. She took all kinds of allergy medicine thinking that was the problem.  Finally a doctor told her it was the Lisinopril and took her off of it .  She has been off of it for two weeks and her cough is gone.,3
"I only took one pill. Took it at night as per the pharmacist in case of dizziness. Woke up the next day with a very red face. by the time I got to work had fatigue and a headache that didnt go away for 6 hours. and that was after taking ibuprofen. Not sure if it was allergic reaction or not but this is the 3rd med I have tried so far. frustrated that I cant find one that doesnt give me a headache. Also, I just took a benicar for the first time so we'll see. after looking up its reviews it doesnt look very promising either. Said a Prayer. (still trying to figure out how I am only 33 and already have HBP.)",1
"I started taking this medication 3 months ago. No symptoms after starting the medicine, but this past month felt like I had a sinus problem with nasal drainage, sore throat,tickle in bad of my throat,tight neck and shoulder muscles. The cough kept getting worse and finally after 2 doses of antibotics, cough medicine and Mucinex the doctor said it was the BP medicine causing my problems and the horrible cough, that kept me up all night. I have arthritis and this aggravated it! I felt I had no energy and my chest felt like I was having bronchiospasms. I am off of it for 2 days and the cough is lessening. Switched to Benicar, so I will wait and see how this med works for me. I really hated this medicine's side effects.",2
Hi Blood pressure 160/80/57,3
"I've had a cough that has lasted over three months. I thought it was bronchitis with a touch of post nasal that never seems to go completely away. Tough sleeping. After reading the other posts here, I'm wondering if the cough is the drug. I also thought my arthritis was getting worse, but I see many people report muscle aches. Time to try something else to compare.",4
"After about 3 week I aquired a continious dry cough, as time went by I coughted day and night, my throat became swollen, and I gained 20 lbs.. Took many meds for cough but it continused to get worst.  During a visit to my Heart Doctor, who checked my meds. said I was having an alergic reaction to to the Lisinopril, and needed to get off of it,and that a high persentage of people are allergic to this medication.  With in 3 days the cough stopped completlet, throat swelling went down, but it took 4 mths. to lose the weight.  There are better medications than Lisinopril.  My neighbor who was also on Lisinopril was just released from the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital after having a severe reaction to Lisinopril.  He had been on it for 3 years, His simptoms came on all of a sudden with swollen throat, tongue, hands and body, and severe breathing problems.  He was lucky, but now he has to carry an injuction medication with him at all times in case he has an allergic reaction to something else, and inject himself or he could die.   Please be carefull with this medication.    ",2

"Like others have said, my doctor didn't warn me about the horrible cough.  Had to switch to Diovan with immediate relief.  Believe Lisinopril is prescribed first because it's cheaper than others and not everyone will get the cough.  Asked 2 other coughing co-workers if they were taking ""blood pressure medicine"" and, sure enough they were.  They also switched to Diovan and all's quiet in the cubicles now.",4

Very satisfied with what the drug did for my Blood pressure but not the side effects I got from taking the medicine for almost a year.  I couldn't figure out why I had this dry hacking cough and the doctor finally told me it was from the medicine.  He didn't tell me that was a side effect when he prescribed it to me.  So I switched to cozaar. We will see how well I do on that.,5

Worked just the same at 10mg.  Flushing still though.  I asked to come off it, especially since blood glucose didn't fall after I had eliminated sugar from diet.  Now I'm on 25 mg Atenolol.  I like it much better.  Flushing of face is gone.  Hopefully by also reducing carbs that blood glucose will go down.  Will check again in 8 weeks.",3

Lastly, I awoke the other night with a bad chest pain and shortness of breath. I thought maybe having a stroke? EKG showed no circultory system damage, thankfully. The Dr. swithched my meds to Diovan 160 mg, and after 4 days I am experiencing lower back pain- I think I am stopping it. I've been on Biovaxine which has phitonutrients and Bp lowering nutrients.

NEW DRUG FOR ME,1
"Am taking  10 mg once a day for BP- it worked okay, taking it down from  160/100 to 130/85. It's been about 6 months now. For me, the occasional cough isn't that bad. My libido seems  a little weak however. ",4
"My 75 year old mother began using this medication and after approximately 2 months she suddenly experienced a serious swelling of her tongue and throat.  We rushed her to the hospital where she ended up in ICU.  Has been difficult reducing the swelling.  Very scary.   About 5 years ago, I also was on this medication for some months when I experienced losing ability to taste and then acute swelling of my face.  Ended up in emergency.  Very allergic to this medication even though it seemed to be effedtive for my blood pressure.  ",5
 I have experienced the cough others have mentioned.  It keeps me from sleeping.  Works great in keeping BP low but I am going to ask for something else because of the cough. ,4
very bad cough all day and night!,1
I have been taking lisinopril for 2 and one half years. Started on 10mg but was very lethargic and was falling asleep in the mid-afternoon. Started to daily monitor my BP; very low 85 over 60. Had dosage changed to 5mg and BP is now normal. Sometimes a dry cough but not often. Also sometimes itchy skin at night. No pain in joints. Also take Hydrochlorothiazide but causes to many trips to the rest room.    Take both meds at night but thing I will switch to taking them in the AM to see if the rest room trips come down at night.,4
"I have been on this for about 6 weeks, and it lowered my BP within the first two weeks.  No side effects, but noticed that within the first three weeks, I lost between 6 and 8 pounds.  Told my Dr. and he said it should not be related to the drug.  I did not see any others posts mentioning weight loss.  I have a follow up appt. w/ my Dr. in a few weeks - my weight has not come back.",5
"Since taking this med,I've had severe fatigue and muscle pain.I still have high blood pressure.",1
"I have been on for over a year. BP is great but I'm constantly tired. In addition I too had lower back pain. Unitl I read the same condition here, I thought I was just getting old. I;ve switched doctors and am trying Diovan. We'll see",5
IF YOU WANT TO STOP HAVING SEX THIS IS THE DRUG FOR YOU.I NEVER HAD HIGH BLOODPRESSURE I BELIEVE MY DR USES IT BECAUSE IT CAN'T HURT.,3
"so far, so good..we will put it to the test.",3
So far no side effects that I am aware of.  I can feel really dizzy at times and not sure if that is attributed to my meds.  Also on Norvasc.  ,4
This drug worked well for my blood pressure but caused me to cough a lot. My hands also would go numb at night while sleeping in bed. These side effects both went away 24 hours after my doctor switched my blood pressure medicine.,5
i hate pills,3
helped control b/p but have had bad cough and muscle weakness also dry skin,4
"I'm experiencing fatigue, mild tremors while lying in bed at night, muscle cramps in legs and back on 10mg.",2
I just hurt all over after taking it,1
"This medicine lowered my B/P but the nagging cough..for 12 months now my doctor feels 2 weeks of no B/P is ok...Im a nervous wreck, also was having allergic reaction to either Lisinopril or Tramadol..not sure but I do feel better, Ive been 10 days no cough...no H/A who knows....but my B/P is elevated..",4
"Have been taking 2.5 mg every day for a little over a month.  First week, BP went down to normal range.  Felt great.  But developed annoying cough especially at night. Keeps me and my husband awake and have not had a good night sleep for the whole month.  Chest feels so tired and i feel weak from lack of sleep and coughing.  This med is not working for me.  need new prescription.  Am glad to hear from other people and to know that the coughing could be due to lisinopril and that there is hope.  i have been dreading sleep for weeks now.  ",2
it helped me control my bloodpresure,5
This lowered my blood pressure immediately and got rid of my headaches.  but now i am so tired I can't stay awake. Not sure what to do. Also have dry cough at night. ,5
"I took one dose of this drug at about 5:30 in the evening. I felt fine until I woke up the next morning (5:15 AM) lightheaded, nauseous, and extemely tired. I slept until 2:30 PM. My prescription was changed to Benicar. I've been on Benicar for 4 days with only a dry cough.",1
"Blood pressure still goes to high at times. Could be normal some days and high others. Dry throat, itchy skin, can not get erection any more. Been on this drug for 4Yrs. Think its time to change, But VA only has certain drugs in there program. I don,t have per. insurance.",4
I just started taking lisinopril/hctz to help protect my kidneys.  I woke up this morning with a swollen tongue. I've called my pharmacist and he told me to pull it from my med list today until I have seen a doctor.  What a bummer!,4
"Do Not combine this with Lipitor. At least on a long term basis it will eventually do havoc with living a normal life. For about 6 months, several doctors, more than two dozen tests, it was this combo that cause sleepless nights, the loss of 30 plus pounds, pain in the lower back, pain in the knee joints etc. etc. I have spoken to several other people some strangers who have gone through the same as I have. So please be advised. Wishing you better luck.",3
I was taking another drug for B/P but with no insurance was very costly so my M.D. switch med to lisinopril 40 mg. not as effective and until I read the reviews wasn't sure why I suddenly developed a deep dry cough with no other symtoms NOW I KNOW>>> guess I will be trying something else!!!!!!,3
"i did get a headace the first day i took it but not sure i can relate it to the med,i was 180/100 prior to taking it and within 24 hour was reading 124/70 it was fast and im happy now",5
"I was constantly having headaches which would turn into migraines when I discovered that my blood pressure was the problem.  I have a family history of high blood pressure and heart disease on both sides.  Taking this medication has stopped my headaches, managed to control my blood pressure, and have had no residule side effects from taking this medication.",5

Once the skin in scratched or rubbed in any way, huge welts appear.  Not sure if this is from this med, but seeing md to have it checked out.  After seeing all the comments by other users, I think I should have mentioned these other effects sooner to the md...  just thought I was getting old and was normal things happening with getting old.",4
"I have had type2 diabetes for several years and only got control of it after losing 100 lbs.No longer on insulin nor oral meds., I suddenly had a blood test result showing the start of kidney disease.My MD put me on prinivil and the 3 month followup blood test showed everything in normal ranges, including my kidneys! Oldie but a goodie.",5

I haven't had any side effects at all and have been on this medication for 2 years now and am a 52 year old female.,5
The pill color could be a little pinker than it currently is.,5
Kept blood presure normal but caused a dry cough.Also had blurred vision so much that I saw an opthomologist who found nothing wrong with my eyesight.  Finally figured it out myself after reading side effects on WebMD and asked for another medication.  Vision cleared up immediately. I took medication 1 month.,3
Very effective at controlling my BP. Have been using Lisinopril for approximately 8 years. The only side affect is a dry cough which is very annoying. My doctor has switched me to Benicar. We'll see what happens.,5
Have been on this with hydroclorithiazide for about a year and it has been effective in lowering my BP with little side effects.,4
"Lisinopril gave me dry throat issues, scratchiness, cough to the point of throwing up. Otherwise it helped with the blood pressure. Doc changed me to something else now.",4
"Two weeks after my heart attack, I took this medication without eating.  It caused me to ""crash"" or ""bradying down"" and I was rushed to the ER and underwent another angioplasty.  If you're on this medication, BE SURE TO EAT when you take it or your pressure may drop dangerously low.  Thank goodness I was at the hospital when I crashed.",3
"my father took this drug Lisinoprill on an empty stomuch and he had a bad side effect. Yesterday he took it on a full stomuch or with food and he had a completely different reaction. So, I his daughter am trying to find alternative theraphies for his treatment.",2

"My blood pressure dropped, and I feel better then I have for years. ",5
I have had a cough so severe with this drug that I've been to my doctor's office four times since I started taking it 6 weeks ago.  The cough is especially bad at night and often leads to the dry heaves.  I would rather have the high blood pressure than this cough.  It is that bad! ,3
Lisinopril was very effective for the first year with some annoying side-effects early on. It has not been as effective over the last 10 months and the cough is back. I think it is time to move on.,3
My BP hasn't gone down any.,1

It just stabilizes my condition which is the goal. I do have the chronic sore throat and occasional cough. Ever once inawhile if I stand up too fast I tend to black out.,4
Was on this for 3 months due to high blood pressure.  Had a cough every day that I was on this medication. Got a head cold and the cough became even worse to the point that my chest hurt from coughing so much. Quit and switched to benicar which I am trying now.,3
"My blood preasure is now in the normal range.  Unfortunately, I need to take Lisinopril along with Ziac.  I have not had the dry cough associated with Lisinopril.",4

The medication seems to work well.  However since taking it I've noticed a decrease in urine.  This I plan to discuss with my doctor on my next visit.  I noticed also eye puffiness and someswelling in my legs.,3
I started with a 10mg dose that wasn't very effective.  My doctor increased the dose to 20mg and I find it to be working.  My presse has gone from  160/100 down to 130/80.  I have had no side effects,4
"Took Lisinopril for two years.  While taking it I suffered from weakness in my legs, and also cough.  Stopped taking it and those symptoms stopped too after two weeks.  Won't take it again but will use the new [email protected] mchine.",5
"My blood pressure dramatically dropped (81/55)but I lost all my energy, my arms ached when trying to do my hair or fold clothes, my stomach cramped terribly and I coughed all night long. I'm too miserable to care about the effectiveness of the drug. I just don't want to take it anymore.",4
"This med worked great for the high blood pressure, however, the dry throat and coughing were bad enough to cause me to see my doctor for another medication.",5
I use it for hypertension and becuse I am a severe Type 2 Diabetic .,5
The constant dry throat and cough attacks brought me to this sight to find something else. It really dropped my blood pressure but the coughing is NOT worth it. Also is taking my energy. I tried Kosar and it didnt work at all.  Time to try something else.,5

my flash headaches often prevent me from going to my gym frequently enough to lose enough weight to lower my blood pressure,3
"Since my Dr. prescribed this drug for me, I have really saw a marked improvemnt. The headaches have stopped and I have an overall better feeling than the other medication that I was taking. I would recommmed Lisinopril highly",5
"My migraines are not as frequent and my blood pressure has remained at normal but I have been experiencing a dry, hacking, vomit inducing cough. I think this medication may be the reason. I have no other problems with it, but will talk to my doctor about the cough.",4

I have type 2 diabetes. This drug has worked very well for me. Also safe on my kidneys. I do take HCTZ along with it for diuretic effects. It has worked GREAT for me.,5
i take so many drugs to control my high blood pressure and sometime none of them work for me............,2
"I was previously prescribed Diovan HCT and I loved it, but couldn't afford it (Absolutely no side affects at all!) but my doc couldn't keep giving me samples: answer: he switched me to Lisinopril and about 1 week after taking this medication, I developed a severe dry-almost choking cough, my muscles in my legs hurt, and the swelling in my hands, face and fingers is just repulsive. My doc either didn't care is too underpaid to notice that apparently these are all some pretty bad side affects. I would rather have high b.p than cough all day and night-I work in a hospital too, so everyone i come in contact with thinks that I'm spreading sickness, when it's just this bothersome side-effect. I have a new appointment with another physician and hope to try something else for my hypertension.",3
"THE MEDICATION WORKED WELL BUT THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE BAD. I COUGHED SO MUCH I HAD BACK PAIN. AFTER RULING OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, IT TURNED OUT TO BE LISINOPRIL MADE ME COUGH, CAUSING THE PULLED MUSCELE",5

"I experienced some fatigue with this med. maybe due to my college student lifestyle.  However, this med. does not work alone.  It should be coupled with exercises and low-sodium diet. This med. did make my blood pressure decline after two weeks.  I was on lisinopril for three months as a teenager. I had to go back on lisinopril or enalapril a few times after starting college because it was hard to keep my bp low without the med. Guess I can't beat my genes without ACE Inhibitors.",4
"I have been on lisinoprol for almost 2 years and my pressure has been very unstable. Weve had to readjust dosage several times. In addition though it is not listed as a side effect, I am having serious dry skin and hair issues.",3
this drug has worked for me brought BP down in 4 weeks....no side efects,5
"Doctor put me on Lisinopril (and kept me on Indapamide which I've taken many years with good results)while in hospital recovering severe bout with emphysema past January.  Was exercising regularly with home equipment, had energy, felt good.  Then WHAM --late August or early September I began this dry, hacking cough which has progressed to TERRIBLE gut-wrenching spasms, occuring at least every 2-3 hours during day, and getting me up several times through night; cough so hard I almost vomit..Also--Muscle spasms & cramps below rib cage, abdomen, legs & feet.  Ankles & feet swelling when I sit or stand any length of time---Runny nose that Claratin, etc. do not help at all--so weak & tired can't do my exercises as needed...and to top it off, am having extreme body heat & cold sweats practically all day and till late at night....I see my doctor again next week and I am absolutely refusing to take any more of this medicine.  I know it's the culprit. ",1

I believe that this med is causing ED.,4
w/in one month developed dry cough w/in 3 mos. developed burning sensation on tongue - ability to taste anything worsened also heartburn-like pain in stomach - not eased w/prescrip. meds. Stopped drug - MD prescribed Zocar - no side effects after one month.  The neuropathy comes and goes however - no promise that it will disappear completely.    Why is it that these particular side-effects are never mentioned by medication sites? thankfully found info after much searching on internet.   Found out this drug may cause a neuropathy ,4

Don't take this drug. Period. Just tell your doctor to give you another.  I am switching back to Benicar for blood pressure control.  Never had a problem with Benicar.",1

Have emphysema (79 Years old) which I can control with RX's and Lozol which have worked well for me.--Also taking 100mgs of gabapentin per day for ""nerve endings"",(causing itching over body) which robs me of all energy so one or both of these meds has to be causing me extra trouble.

"i, too--have been coughing like crazy, was going to try an experiment and stop it for a few days and see if cough goes away, then start it again and see if cough returns. if it does will ask for a different drug---works great for bringing my pressure down!",5
Although this med. brought down my blood pressure to normal it makes me cough almost constantly !!,5
I took this med along with pravastatin and got very bad headaches. ,3
what the hell is this drug (lisinopril-dietary supp #10)?  it's not a dietary supplement -- it's a prescription drug.,1
i take this for high blood presure and have be having joint pain in my hands,1
I am having joint pain and muscle pain.  My husband was on this drug 2 years ago and suffered sever hives and swelling.,4
"Just a few side effects like dryness of throat, mucus formation in the morning when I wake up resulting in my difficulty to swallow. Yet, manageable and my blood pressure has been normal the past 4 years I've been taking 2mg. Before that I was taking only 1mg.",5
After 2 days of use I suffered for a severe anaphylactic shock and prominent swelling of toungue and Throat.  Sorry to bring up such bad news about this medication but a danger for me.,3
"Have been using 2mg for at least 2 years, worked fine, new dr.  wanted my blood pressure lower, switched me to 4 mg.  Side effects, include dizziness, nausea,  tiredness .  This is right after i take it, i still feel that my legs are heavy weighted sometimes...and there is itchiness sometimes....",3
"I've had high blood pressure since 15 years old, I'm now 42. During that time I struggled with side effects. Seems like every new drug I would take had horrendous side effects. I was exasperated, and my doctors hated me always asking to try new drugs. One day a pharmacist I know suggested I try Mavik. This drug is great! I have no side effects, I feel great and I no longer dread taking my medicine. Been on it 2 years now taken with 12.5mg HCTZ. Dropped my pressure from 160/100 down to a textbook 120/80.",5
"severe side effects for 1 year of using medication: cough (dry, persistent) difficulty swallowing or breathing; unusual hoarseness After I stopped taking Mavik, everything was OK.",3
"Male, 51, 30lbs overweight, somewhat sedentary, had high blood pressure during difficult business/career transition period. Ran out of tablets and was without for one week after taking them for over 6 months, Bp was 140/90 at next doctor's visit for more tablets and tests. One test revealed a first degree heart block. This is probably (hopefully) due to the Mavik. Will do stress test and 2 week heart monitor then probably get off this drug. Will also continue to reduce stress and increase exercise. Cheers.

I have had no trouble using this medication.,4
Mavik has been very effective for me with no side effects,5
"12.5 daily is keeping HR/bp down with no side effects  25mg was too much for me very sedated, dizzy, chest felt funny. Slowed me down too much. Half daily is working just right. HR rarely goes above 100 which is a big change. Resting HR was in the 120+ sometimes up to the 150’s due to crazy stress/anxiety.  Working on my stress levels next. This is the only prescription I take.",5
"I take this for BP and chest pain for nearly a year now. It has improved my life as my chest pains happen much less often and when they do come they are not as severe. My BP can go high as it ever did but most of the time it is perfect which it hasn't been for many years. I don't understand all the side effects everyone has listed in their reviews, I only had minor joint pain for 2-3 weeks and it went away, no other side effects. I feel much better taking this medication. ",3
"I started taking 50 mg of Metoprolol daily in February 2016. Back then I was a 68 year old male in good health except for high blood pressure. In March 2017 I began to develop the first signs of PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s disease. They were painful erections, curvature of erect penis and the presence of a structure inside the penis. The structure was plaque and I could feel it inside the soft penis. I went to three urologists. They all said I had PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s disease and to do nothing because it might go away. It slowly got worse up to the present time. I googled Ã¢Â?Â?PeyronieÃ¢ 94;?Â?s and MetoprololÃ¢Â?Â and came up with two scientific articles linking PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s to Metoprolol. I then examined the the WebMD data on Metoprolol and saw as one of the side effects of Metoprolol Ã¢Â?Â?PeyronieÃ¢ 94;?Â?s diseaseÃ¢Â?Â. I immediately stopped taking the drug. That was yesterday, October 12, 2018. I am hopeful that the PeyronieÃ¢Â?Â?s will disappear. I will report back here in three months.",3
"THIS WORKED FOR ME AFTER GETTING OFF METOPROLOL. I remembered hearing nurse tell doctor after started walking on treadmill stress test irregular heartbeat stopped. So I wanted to see if would help on my own. I started walking on treadmill at 1.3 for 5 minutes, 1.5 for 5 minutes, 1.8 for 5 minutes then 2.0 for 15 minutes. After 1 month I started 1.5 for 5 minutes 1.8 for 5 minutes 2.0 for 20 minutes.  Everyday. After 3 months the palapatations stopped.  I walk everyday for this 30 minutes. I cut back on sugar, stopped Tylenol and anything I was taking at night to help me sleep as o read these effect the heart also.  I think itâ??s the steady treadmill that works and not sure just walking outside would . Ask your doctor if healthy enough to walk on treadmill.  It worked for me and metoprolol really started all my problems terrible med for me. Hope this works for you too.",1
IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE MAKE YOUR DR.PUT YOU ON ANOTHER BP MED.  THIS IS LIKE TAKING POISON IN YOUR BODY. IT CAUSES SOOOOO MANY SIDE EFFECTS IT ISN'T WORTH IT.   THERE ARE SOOOOOOOOO MANY OTHER CHOICES.  IF I COULD GET OFF THIS I WOULD.   WHY THEY EVER PRESCRIBE THIS POISON I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.  ,4
"After finally convincing my doctor that this medication was making me feel horrible, he took me off of it.I was not sleeping, had severe aches,digestive issues, and such.  I immediately felt better.  Have since spoken to 2 different people where their cardiologists have removed Metoprolol from their use upon learning their GP prescribe it for them. There are too many other good options for lowering bp, than taking this poison.",2
"I was placed on Metoprolol ER 11 years to treat SVT.  I recall I started on 25 mg and now Iâ??m up to 150mg/day.  It took about a year to get me regulated and I recall feeling extremely tired.  One positive I very seldom have migraine headaches now.  I find my energy levels arenâ??t what they used to be and I have gained a lot of weight, of course that could just be getting older too. Lol.  Recently my pharmacy changed their supplier for metoprolol and within 4 days I became symptomatic- extreme fatigue, breakthrough tachycardia, irregular heartbeat.  Had to locate another pharmacy that carries the original supplier of my med.  Has anyone else had this issue?  Iâ??m guess Iâ??m just real sensitive to the manufacturer of this product.  ",4
"The day after i started using metoprolol i began having side effects. First it was nausea and loss of appetite, then wanting to sleep in the daytime (I never do this), no energy at all, couldn't accomplish anything, anxiety, and felt this way for 3 weeks before it dawned on me it might be the change in blood pressure meds. Wheen I looked up side effects of this drug I knew it was not for me. Am back on Atenolol which had been discontinued manufacturing and already feeling better. Wondering how long the effects oc metoprolol wil be in my system. i'm glad it works for some, but for me it was like poison. but one more thing i took info from here https://just-medicine.com/",4
Dr prescribed 1/2 pill was working lowered my bp but then put me on full pill. Got stomach cramps and diarrhea and depression feel like I'm going crazy now bp going up up up. ,1
I now have a pet monster living under my bed since taking this drug but that’s ok ,5
"Was put on this poison about 6 months ago to control high blood pressure and high anxiety. The very first night I took it, I thought I was dying...blurry vision, numbness, freezing, panic attack. Awful. After that it seemed to help for a few months...and then didn't. And then my hair started falling out. My doctor thought I was iron deficient, I was not iron deficient. Turns out it's this horrible medication. So now I have even MORE anxiety and have to fix all the other problems it's caused me. My doctor switched me to Amlodipine and Celexa, stopping the Metoprolol cold turkey (although I questioned it and was told it would be fine). Big mistake. Huge. Got to work and thought I was having a heart attack. Ended up in urgent care and then the ER. Now tapering off like I should have in the first place and it hasn't been pleasant. I can't wait until this poison is out of my system. I'm already noticing my hair isn't falling out like it was. I don't know if this works for other people but I will never go near it again. Beware.",1
"4 months ago, I had transcather aortic valve replacement.  6 wks.ago started on Metoprolol  25mg. 1X day, seemed to manage Palpitations well, lower BP. No change in frequent skipped beats.  2 weeks ago MD Increased to 2X day because BP still too high, within 7 days have I had severe leg and foot cramps, numbness and pain in legs, feet and hands, also in thighs. Have reduced to 1X day, and will start half tab, then stop.  I had been doing 2 1/2 mile walk daily, and had to completely stop due to foot pain. Will see Cardiologist in 1 wk.  I blame symptoms on addition of metoprolol. Also 3 years have been on Arimidex and  2 weeks Xarelto , which can cause similar side effects.  But change in dose of metoprolol seems a significent reason for symptoms. Certainly agreed to by so many comments on Webmd. ",3
when the dose stops working as your doctor for a higher dose or a split one.,4
"I take several meds for ADHD, Blood pressure, Triglycerides and Indigestion for at least 5 years. I took Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg to to counteract increased BP from ADHD meds. Wasn't enough. Went to 100mg and worked for a while. They were supposed to be taken twice a day but couldn't remember to take 2nd dose at night so Doc changed it to Metoprolol Succinate 100mg 1/day for extended release. BP got higher, so raised to 150mg. My side effects are:Lack of energy, Lowered my sex drive, ED, Cold hands and feet, Hips & right knee hurt, Feet hurt, Mood swings, More confrontational, Blurry vision reading, Gained 15lbs, Indigestion, Muscle weakness, Frequent muscle strains in arms,  Tinnitus, Severe loss of long and short term memory, Have trouble finishing sentences or thought processes, especially when trying to talk to people. Can't use the right word for things when telling someone about it, even though I know what it is. It comes back to me later. Same with people's names. From the reviews I have read, I can attribute most or all of these symptoms to Metoprolol. I'm on so many meds, I can't rule it out until I stop taking this and re-evaluate side effects.",2
"Coughing my head off. Take 25mg ER metoprolol and coughing my head off. My primary says itÃ¢Â?Â?s the losartan and not the metoprolol. Well this morning waiting on my cardiologist today to call me back to change losartan, I did not take losartan this morning. Very seldom did I cough. At 1:30 I took my regular dose of metoprolol 25mg and within 30 minutes coughing my head off again.  I find it very upsetting that the cardiologist and primary drs do not talk to each other and put us in the middle going back and forth. Metoprolol does cause severe cough in some people!!!",5
Has a bonus side effect of curbing nicotine urges. Also keeps Vtach and Vfib from happening along with Amiodarone.  But on too high a dose it can make you really tired.,5
"This does work, as my doc started me out on a VERY low dose, 25mg in morning and 25mg in evening. Everyone is different so have your doctor adjust your meds if you have undesireable side effects!",4
This medication is dropping my blood pressure big time.,1
"Have not taken yet, doctor prescribed just yesterday.",1
"I absolutely hate this drug. I can't wait to go back on metoprolol tartrate. I've been taking metoprolol succinate for almost 4 weeks and it makes me feel awful. It only helps my bp. My migraines are back and much more frequent and severe. I developed heartburn. Depression has surfaced. Just overly sleepy even after a good night's rest. I find myself taking deep breaths often because my chest feels heavy and the palpitations have returned and are more frequent and painful. I also have constant swelling in my ankles, mostly the right one. Blurred vision is now a problem. I hate this drug and will never take it again,",1
Medication has made me very ill. I'm tapering off this drug. ,1
The only problem that I noted with this medications is my anxiety increased a bit along with diarrhea.,3
Need does dose adjustment.,2
"I have not experienced any side effects from these meds, but it has slowed down my heart rate. I now have a heart rate of 85 - 90 instead 105 - 115.",4
"I/F took Metoproolol,gave me Gout. went back to Toprol.Friend in Ct.gave her Gout, another friend in SC gave him gout.",2
Been taking this drug for many years with no side effects that I know of. I do have some diarrhea but I am on several other meds for diabetes. ,5
No side effects.   ,5
"I've read about weight gain in some people who reviewed this medication.  I've had terrible upper intestinal bloating, regardless of what I eat or how much! I'm so uncomfortable. Have always maintained a healthy weight but now feel just miserable. Also, I have swelling in my feet, into my ankles, but much worse in my right foot! All of this has shown up since I started Metoprolol.",3
"Lethargic, hard to focus memory problems, much reduced energy and I am ordinarily a high energy individual. My son-in-law took the medication and said he had the same symptoms. I had a stroke!! I was convinced it was caused by this drug. I did some research with my pharmacist and my endocrinologist. This drug crosses the brain.  I asked my neurologist to change me to atenolol which does not cross the brain and all of the above symptoms have gone but it took a year to get it out of my system and I began to feel normal again. I am doing fine on the atenolol but it is not slow release. I am taking the drug because I was diagnosed in my 30's with premature ventricular contractions. I took no meds for it until I was 65 and the symptoms became more pronounced, 18,000 dropped heartbeats within 24 hours. My sister has been diagnosed with the same thing so I think it was inherited. The medication controls the pvc's but I have trouble with a slow heart rate, the case all my life,  and I can only take 25mg. THE CROSSING OF THE BRAIN OF THIS DRUG WAS VERIFIED BY MY ENDROCOLOGIST. HE SAID HE GIVES THIS MEDICATION TO HIGH STRUNG INDIVIDUALS AS IT KEEPS THEM ON AN EVEN KEEL BUT PRESCRIBES ATENOLOL TO MORE CALM LAID BACK PATIENTS. (that's ME. I HAVE SEVEN SIBLINGS IN MY FAMILY AND NONE IN MY FAMILY HAS EVER HAD A STROKE BUT ME. Even though I was originally paralyzed on my entire right side, I am happy to report, I am completely recovered. I am convinced this medication  caused my stroke. People do your research!  ",1
"Originally prescribed Bystolic (after a heart attack) for high blood pressure.  Switched to Metoprolol ER Succinate 25mg per day because much cheaper for me and my insurance company. Drug works well for controlling my blood pressure but believe it is responsible for some bad side affects. I have memory loss, can not focus on anything, seem to be confused frequently (especially with calendar dates/days/time), do not sleep well anymore, leg cramps at nite, frequent gas. Seems like just can not clearly think anymore. Very scary. I am currently 63 years old and everyone telling me I'm just getting old, it's normal. Maybe, but I just requested my doctor take me off of the medication. Going back to Bystolic 5 Mg ASAP and will pay the extra cost. ",4
Since starting this medication I have been lethargic with difficulties focusing. I have added 20 lbs regardless of how much I diet and exercise. Id rather die living life than hanging around watching it go by.,5
Weight gain & unable to lose weight. Also fatigued a lot.,5
"The side effects that I've experienced the most is weight gain. I've been taking for nearly a year and have gained over 30 lbs. I stay active and weight keeps gaining, also had issues with libido ",5
"Just wanted to share my experience getting OFF metoprolol ER 25 mg, and switching to Diltiazem ER, 120 mg. After a pulmonary embolism (no symptoms except PVCs), I suffered PVC w/anxiety and panic attacks, even while treating blood clots with Coumadin. I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly. I developed symptoms of asthma, wheezing and chest tightness   severe fatigue. Reported my symptoms finally, and I was switched to Diltiazem. After 8 days of body adjustment (w/small amount of Ativan a few nights to control anxiety), I again felt human. Exercise is now more efficient. In my case, It was a direct switch from one med to the other. Yes, I think I had some adjustment coming off metroprolol- headache, chills, uneasiness, muscle cramps, a little heart pounding, slightly higher pulse rate (no pvcs however), and bp went up about 10 points (not a big issue for me). All the symptoms of having too much adrenalin. I took it easy that first week- low exertion, low stress (well, that is debatable- election week), .25 to .5 mg Ativan at night the first 4 nights or so. By 1st day, better breathing. By 8 days, I felt much better overall. 120 mg Diltiazem ER has not produced any noticeable adverse effects for me, at least, at this point. I'm 41, a divorced mom of 4, I usually walk now about 10,000 steps every day, and I'm about 40 lbs overweight (so happy to be able to work on this now :) Good luck! Hang in there. Talk to your doctor and ask for help when you need it.",3
This medication made by Watson was good for me no side effects until I took Actavis brand I started having itchy red rashes on both my arms ,5
"I am 35 years old and take this for High blood pressure that was pregnancy induced. I absolutely love it my heart rate was always high as well now I stay in 60s, BP is good, and I sleep better. I have not gained any weight and have no negative side effects I feel so much better now that my bp and heart rate are controlled.",5
"In a few weeks of using this drug, my hair started falling out.  Fortunately it grew back after discontinuing this drug and switching to another one. ",4
"I was prescribed 50 mg ER metoprolol 1x/day in the evening. In the first 2 weeks I gained 3 lbs and after 4 weeks I had gained 2 more. By then I was experiencing increasingly bad side effects. Worst was insomnia almost every night. Also had gastro-intestinal issues, flatulence, confusion, memory issues, increased sweating. My blood pressure was controlled very well but it wasn't worth the side-effects. Asked doctor for another medication. Don't like the literature I read on the side-effects of that one either, but we'll see.",2
"Have taken this for about 3 years (25mg/day) for SVT.  Before diagnosis I was getting spells of light-headedness and near fainting.  Short periods of very rapid heartbeat.  I am otherwise healthy and active.  Upside: Symptoms are largely gone now.  Also has a calming effect.  Downside: less energy, hair loss and change in hair texture, occasional numbness in fingertips when cold.  Don't like the side effects, but better than scary rapid heartbeat.",5
Dizziness,2
worked initially but then had an increase in BP. Increased the dose to 50mg at bedtime. SO far no side effects and no difficulties ,4
"After reading a lot of reviews I realize the depression, feeling of no , I mean zero energy, weight gain (40lbs)tingling painful feet and fingers, swollen legs and ankles, hair loss, exhaustion, breathing problems.. This is serious I feel my body is forgetting to breathe and was put on oxygen this week. I never thought of this coming from this medicine but I know it has caused my memory loss, which is so darn bad I was thinking I have dementia. I'm 62 and not in good health so why in the world would they give me a medicine that would cause every problem I have to get worse. I didn't have high BP till I took this medicine now if I miss a pill within a couple hours I will have a 139/70 reading with a 100 pulse. I am going to try to get off of it if it doesnt kill me. I was prescribed this medicine for a ER visit because of supra ventricular tachacardia which hospitilized me. I have a calcified valve. I am clueless what to take in it's place. Bless one and all.",2
I need this medicine to slow my heart rate as it will take off racing. Supraventricular Tachacardia caused by a calcified valve. If I miss a pill I will have a tachacardia episode. I hate that I am trapped taking this medicine. I feel it can be dangerous. I don't see a way to get off of it. It lowers my mild hypertension ok. ,4
It is helped me a lot with my blood pressure,3
"Was diagnosed w HBP/extremely high heart rate...(had this a while but was in denial and figured it was stress, it will go away) .was having shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, flushing, red eyes......I finally listened to dr and actually filled RX this time. Within days of taking Metoprolol ER 50mg x1 day, I feel like a new person, I actually feel healthy again!  I can't believe I let myself go for so long and risked my health. I have read some ppl it doesn't agree with but I have to say it has worked PERFECT for me and I'm kicking myself for being so stubborn. If u have the symptoms I had and your dr gives u this don't put it off, try it. I was apprehensive YES but wow, I'm 48 and feel NORMAL again!!!  Hope this helps someone.",5
"I am taking this med for HTN which it working okay for, and also for the CAD that I was diagnosed with after my heart attack back in Oct 2015. I have leg cramps very restless at night, I still have chest pain with activity and when i am resting, reoccuring jaw and arm pain that is annoying and the SOB is intolerable. It seems my joint pain has gotten worse and I have this terrible pain that comes and goes on the top side of my left foot.",3
"I have had awful side effects.  Been on drug 1 week, extreme fatigue, hip pain, feeling depressed, sore throat and cough.  I cannot take atenol, don't know why my dr put me on this.  Seeing a cardiologist next week, getting off of drug, no quality of life.  I have chronic pain syndrome and it's making it worse, doctors get insulted if you can't tolerate what they prescribed!",3
"I don't recommend this med. I took it after stopping Lisinopril which made ringing of ears worse. I stopped Taking Metolrolol because i got problems breathing when i went outside,as if I developed an allergy. I also put on weight for no reason (my weight has always been steady and im not a sedentary person). My night time urination increased. I got a stubborn pain in my right foot that came and went constantly. And the most exasperating thing was that I got a rash around my neck and abdomen that i had never had before. I'm now taken Doxazosin that will replace both my BP and BPB (enlarged prostate medications. I hope it works.",2

I have awful headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, hip pain, my hands and feet are freezing, severe drowsiness, my attitude has changed to the point that my Co-workers think I am on something. I am stopping this medicine immediately. And to make matters worse my blood pressure is still high! I feel like I am not my normal fun loving self. I am a zombie with little or no emotion. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything. I can not wait to get off this. ",1

"As far as I am concerned this drug is deadly. I was prescribed this drug after hydrochlorozide produced tachycardia. Instead of taking me off the hydrochlorozide I was put on metropolol. This made my heart feel like it was going to pound through my chest during every episode of arrhythmia. During these episodes I constantly felt lightheaded, was very tired, my ankles would swell up, and constantly had to urinate. No matter how I complained about it I was not taken off of this drug. Of course, I'm with the VA. They never listen to the patient. It wasn't until I got off of Metropolol and began taking d-Ribose that everything began to calm down. It seems that d-Ribose does the same thing without the side effects.",1

"I have taken this med  for many years without any side effects.  The thing I don't like about it is, that when it wears off (24 hours) my heart rate goes up and I can feel my heart  beating in my chest and I don't feel good.  I get worried when I 'm getting low on pills. Your body gets used to blocking the adrenaline effects on your heart so when the drug wears off it causes a rebound tachycardia or a very fast heart rate to occur. That's what I hate about  it.",4
"Have taken metoprolol tar for about 30 years, primarily for PVCs, secondarily for blood pressure   First year I was quite tired, but got over That.  I stay active and have felt good since.

"Was prescribed for chest pain, irregular heartbeat (PAC's & PVC's) and high blood pressure. At times felt like heart was going to jump out of my chest or beating as if I had run a marathon. Very happy with results and has done a good job in contolling both with no side effects so far after 30days",4
"I have been on this medicine about 3 weeks. Ive gone from a happy person to a very depressed person, I have cloudy thoughts and extreme dizziness. I sleep very little and am very restless at night.. I have an appt in a week and am definitely getting off this medicine.. ",1
Started taking Metoprolol 25mg at bedtime. I have been extremely fatigued and can barely stay awake at work. Also my vision has become very blurry had eyes checked prior to starting and they were fine. Now everything is a blur and florescent lighting is horrible. Ringing in ears and bp is 83/62. I feel like my heart is barely beating at times. Scared to stop so calling DR to see if I can take half a dose to eventually get off of it!!! Blood sugar readings are low as well.  ,3
"This medication worked well on preventing migraines but my goodness the side effects are horrible! Vertigo, head feels foggy, hard to concentrate, trying to just talk and find the right words is a chore, vision problems, so tired no amount of caffeine helps, diarrhea.

"Did little or nothing to reduce my blood pressure even after doubling the dose, but it did have effects: significant evening fatigue and pretty severe depression. Hated this stuff.",1

"I have been taking this medication for 1 year because of PVCs (preliminary Ventricular Contractions) I have rapid extra heart beats and it slows my heart rate. I cannot take the recommended dosage, so I cut the 50 mg pill to 37.5 and it has helped significantly. Otherwise I get very tired taking the 50. I am in my 40's and postmenopausal, which is in theory what is causing my PVCs. The emergency room try to treat me with Xanax, but it wasn't anxiety, it is hormonal.",5
This medicine successfully control my high BP. But I feels that my memory power is reducing slowly. I don't know is it due to the intake of this medicine or due to something else?   ,3
"Has kept my Blood pressure down but my heart rate is still 100 BPM. Get sharp pains in my chest, heartburn, dizzyness and sleepy. Taking 25mg seems to be the correct dosage for me..  I tried taking half (12.5) and that made it worse.",3

The pharmacy has the above pill but switched the pill to metoprolol  ext rel. they said it was a new wholesaler. Does it have the same ingredient and the same effect?? The pharmacy never told me about the change . When I opened the bottle I noticed the pill was not the same shape.i called the pharmacy and they said it was a new wholesaler .

It works well, I take it after dinner every night.Maybe not for everyone but works good on controlling my blood pressure and fast heart rate.",5
caused me to sleep 16 - 18 hours per day I couldn't function normally. I was wrongfully accused of being a drug addict. Had to spend $1200.00 for drug and hair testing to prove I wasn't a drug addict. I lost my job. It destroyed my life. It didn't control my blood pressure. It should be removed from the market! It destroyed my liver. ,1
I am noticing that I am stuttering for the very first time.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have been taking this medication for about 2 months.,4
Operation-heart beat,5
Keeps my BP  stabilized within its normal range and at times a little lower  as in 91/65  and heart rate around 55.  Has stopped my heart from skipping beats.  I am very satisfied with this medication.,5

a fiberlation ,3
"I question why my MD prscribed this drug.  BP still hi, I have numbness in my toes and will contact her to change meds.  I also am on plavix, novasc and 325 aspirin.",1

"I had a fairly-sudden onset of a ""fluttery"" feeling in my chest. When it didn't let up, I went to the hospital and was admitted for tests/observation.

My pulse is very week so week my other Dr. has a hard time taking my BP and pulse, not sure why.",1
"Took this once before. Forgot about side effects.  Have been on it about 10 days and I am coughing at night, just like Lisinopril. Very cold hands and feet, compounded by metal strips binding broken leg bones. Stomach pains like that for aspirin reaction. Vivid and confusing dreams. No wonder I stopped previously.

I am going back to my doctor and getting off of this medication.",1
"Well have had  some side affects that  I attribute  to taking it on an empty stomach,(I am not much of a morning eater). Some dizziness, and just an uncomfortable feeling. But I took the advice of  a co-worker who was also being treated with it, and stated eating before I take it and  those things  stopped.  (It instructs you not to take on an empty stomach),otherwise I would say it as worked fine. I enjoy the calming affect it as on me.. It just kicks my level down a notch or two and I feel more at ease through my day. My experence with taking it as been good so far.",4
Used to treat POTS. Very effective ,5
some time at night I wake up my fingers  feel  numb and I am questing the possibility of it coming from taking the metoprolol,3
Tolerated the drug well.  It has regulated my heart rate but the afib continues.  Have no problem maintaining a regular exercise schedule.  ,4
I have such sever fatigue that I find it hard to get up in the morning.  Sometimes sleeping as late s 11 or 12,3
"I took this crap and experienced the blahs pretty bad. stopped after a few months as doctor couldn't really give a good reason for taking it. HOWEVER, my husband has been taking 100mgs for a number of years. Several side effects we were not aware of so did not associate with the med. For the past several years his feet have gotten more and more numb. Hands too. Now they are totally numb and it is moving up his legs. Walks like he is 90 (he is 64) I looked it up and OMG!! He has cut dose on half and improved in a matter of days. He is going to cut to 1/4 next week. I am livid!!!! to say the least. I suppose the ED, hair loss, skin problems, wheezing and the other problems over the years are due to this poison. Of course, he could have read the fine print when he started it. ",2
This stuff is poison. Side effects decrease the quality of life with no guarantee it will extend your life. The food and drug should reevaluate the use of this drug. It does not help.,1
Immediate feeling of blah. Agitated and aggravated; mostly for doctor insisting that I take this stuff. Finally told her I was not taking it since there was no clear reason that I needed it. It's bad stuff.,1
"Take Avapro in a.m. and this med at p.m. seems to work fine, heart rate slowed (have mild tachycardia) and high b.p. so far so good.....",5
"After a year of taking it, experienced the worst episode of vertigo, to the point that I had to go the ER.",3
Don't know why I am using this,2
causes impotence,4
I HAVE FELT LIKE I'M IN A FOG SINCE I BEGAN TAKING THIS MEDICATION.  I'M CONFUSED AND HAVE HALLUCINATIONS.  MY DOCTOR IS FINALLY ALLOWING ME TO TAPER OFF IT AFTER NEARLY A YEAR OF COMPLAINT. ,1
"One week on drug, my BP has lowered from 175/83 to 139/73.  I have slight uneasiness/heaviness in my chest ... Don't know if it's heart slow down or lung problem. Had none of this before starting on the pill.  ",4
I have cold feet on most days which I contribute to this drug,3
"For all previous reviewers...ask your doctor to switch you to Coversill Plus for high blood pressure.  Metoprolol works much better for ventricular vasospasms etc....I have had high BP since my 30's and have tried all kinds of meds...Coversil is the best.  I've had 2minor heart attacks...Metoprolol has so far worked best for heart beating hard and fast during rest periods...i am tired alot but the benefit for me is out weighing what I went through twice already...Please ask your Doctor about coversil plus...I've been through atenolol, norvasc, and others I can't remember and Coversilplus  is best med for hypertension. It used to be just Coversil but now has the dieretic combined in it...hence the ""plus""",5
satisfactory with performance of drug for control of BP,5
"Weight gain, hair loss, dry cough, EXTREME dry itchy ears, hard to breath, tingling in hand & fingers over 2 years; doctor ignores my complaints!",1
"within 3-5 days after beginning this medication at 25 mg daily dosage, I begin to have difficulty breathing and nausea.  Unable to walk 25 yards without stopping to regain my breath.  Experience tightness in my lower chest & chronic nausea.  My doctor advised me to reduce dosage to 12.5 mg (cutting the 25mg tablet) after I complained of symptoms.  These reactions to the drug continued for 5 months and became progressively more severe.  Cardiologist & internal medicine physicians discussed the possibility of discontinuing the medication for a 2-3 period.  Above mentioned symptoms stopped within 4 days.",1
"Med. worked great at first when other b.p. meds failed, this doesn't make me light headed, however the side effects creeped up over time like no sex drive, weight gain, hair loss and tire easily. All extreme opposite of who I am! Started on 25mg within 2 years now 100mg twice a day.",4
After taking this for several months my BP was still 130's over 80's. Had terrible swelling in hands and feet. The wheezing was so bad I couldn't sleep at night. Terrible muscle pain and shortness of breath. Doctor changed me Lisinopril and the difference is amazing! BP 120's over 70's and feel so 100% better!,2
"Works fine, but find that I am fatigued as a result",5
"Was given this medication after heart surgery 4 mo's ago. Now I have extreme sleepiness, sometimes I get back in bed and sleep 6 hours in the day plus the night.  My hair is excessively falling out and filling the shower drain.  I feel nauseous,constipation for 4 days, then diarrhea like liquid running down my legs for 3 days. Excessive gas until the diarrhea starts.  Have lost lot of weight because I'm afraid to eat. Told cardiologist, referred to GP, got medicine for diarrhea, still have diarrhea.. I have to cancel appointments because of this diarrhea. I'm at my wit's end.",3
Have diarrhea several times a week.  Wonder if this medication causes it.  Also tremendous gas.,4
sometimes i get hives ,4
Thought I would try the generic Toprol XL again due to not having insurance. What a big mistake. Tried it before and it gave me Asthma. Now after taking it for a month I developed major constipation and chest congestion. So now I'm having to bite the bullet and go back to the real Toprol XL. The difference of the generic verses the non-generic is un-freakin real! ,3
Used for irregular heartbeat.  Absolutely no side effects so far.,4
Extreme pain in my legs.  It feels like they are exploding! It helped with my PVC,3
No problems.,4
This med will cause daytime sleepiness. Take at bedtime.   ALSO FDA has new warning on FDA website re: Ineffectiveness of this drug.,3
"33yr old male, husband and father of 2 w/family history of HBP.  I play softball and cut my own grass.  Chase the kids.  Swim.  Ride bikes with the kids.  Never had any major health problems short of a torn ACL/MCL few yrs back.   I'm a normal, healthy guy.  Doc put me on this stuff couple wks ago since my BP had been creeping up the last few visits.  I FEEL LIKE I'M LOOSING MY MOTHERFRAPPING MIND!!!!!!!  Constant ringing/""static"" in my ears...  calves/thighs been cramping (aka ""charlie horse"") like crazy... head's been kinda... ""swimmy""???  Kinda light headed or foggy???  But by far the worst, most maddening side effect is the GOTDAM TINGLING IN MY TOES!!!!!!!  Jeeeeezus, I can't stand it.  It's like my toes/feet and falling asleep and there's that tingling, numbing, sandy feeling.  ALL.  THE.  TIME.  I think I'd rather be impotent.  Yeah, that's how bad the tingling is.  To clarify the one 5 star rating, of course it's ""easy to use"", it's  a pill.  Gulp it on down.  Bottom line, me and this med don't get along.  If you're having similar side effects, you're not loosing it, they're for real.  Me, I'm get'n another HBP med.  ",1
I have less energy and am tired I have severe shoulder pain it is worse when I am resting and then try to move my arms also arthritus has gotten much worse .,5
"Three days ago I started on the 100 mg tab and got bad headaches.  I went back to my pink pills of twice a day, I think the 100 mg. is too strong for me all at once.",3
I started taking 12.5 mg. of this med. two years ago for benign pre atrial contractions.  Nothing wrong with my heart per numerous tests.  After one year the pac started again big time.  Increased to 25 mg.for past year I am extremely tired can't walk daily which I love to do.  The 25 mg. also brings my blood pressure down too low as I had no real problem with blood pressure to begin with.  My doctor thinks I should try a calcium channel blocker instead but they have the same side effects.  I have been to cardiologists and electrophysiologists and no one can tell me why I have pacs.  Very upset with the medical profession!!!!!!!,4
"Took this drug because had been eating more meat and BP was high for first time in my life.  Worked to bring down BP, but 4 weeks in, started seeing hair in the drain of shower, and I NEVER lose my hair in the shower, ever.  I clean my brush maybe once per yr, that is how rare it is, and after not taking it for one month, still losing hair!  I am furious!  If I had been told by my doctor or Rx that this was a side effect, I would have never taken it at all!",1
Side effect causes me sleepiness for long periods of the day...,4
50MG prescribed for Irregular heart beat and to lower BP. After several months I notice a gratual loss of energy until I had to stop doing a lot of things I routinely do. Dr  is taking me off of the med. over a two week period. I am having some headaches and muscle and joint pains since I started the weaning off process. BP and heart rate is improving but overall weakness is still a problem.,3

It truly does help,but in the last few months,I have lost patches of hair,in two places,on the back of my head.I'm having difficulty growing hair back,in one spot.

Metaprolol had catastrophic consequences for her and for my family. Coming off the med. after I moved her across Canada, her MMSE went up to 22/30 and she has been able to have some independence and better years. Constant pressure to put her on higher dose of cardiazem, makes her fall, become demented, last time her BP down to 80/50 before doctors agreed to lower the dose. No advice every given by cardiologist about diet, exercise, stress, no monitoring of other health problems other than heart which affect her taking such meds. I know lots of people who have been unable to take beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers, people seem to do well on warfarin (not a possibility in my mother's case due to history of falls) Disgustd at the med. and at the terrible attitude of the cardiologists her in Halifax.",4

After 3days of taking Metropolol (25mg/day) I experienced chest tightness, pressure and slight heart pain, also drop in heart rate to low 40's. The idea was to lower heart rate while in A-Fib but also to continue for prevention ?.

A protective approach to heart care. I said you need to listen to me and the cardiologist needs to listen to me. I do not sleep well at all. It is affecting every aspect of my life. I am depressed and I need to get quality sleep. I am short tempered, spacey, tired all the time. I ride my bike as frequently to work as I can 4 miles a day. I was hit by a car while riding this summer and still ride the bike - a little scarey at this point. My osteopath said she will see talk with the cardiologist and see if they can come up with a game plain. I will start on a metabolic diet in a week.

"Take 200mg at bedtime.  Started at 100mg but was moved to 200.  At that level it controlled my BP very well with consistent readings of 120-125 over 69-72 & pulse of 69.  Dr. added Benicar HCT 40/12.5 to get ride of ankle/feet swelling.  No change in diet required other than to be reasonable.  However, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about a year ago, so I started taking Metformin 500 mg.  Needed to increase that to 1000mg--taken after dinner.  Diabetes is under control but the Metformin has raised my BP dramatically so Lisinopril has also been added.  The best we've able to do is readings of 137/52 fairly consistently but at times is in the 140s with bottom # still in 50s.  Top # just won't come under control. My cholestrol went through the roof as did my triglycerides--all bec. of the Metformin & diabetes.  We've now added Tricor and Pravastatin to control these two new conditions which helped.  I'm frustrated bec. all these new health problems have come about bec. of the diabetes and Metformin.  I don't know what to do.  It's very depressing.  Maybe all the medications contribute to that.

"Have pacemaker, cardiologist said there showed a glitch in the heart rhythm on 2 occasions.  Switched from Cardura to Metoprolol.  Advised doctor that because of allergies, I cannot take generics. He insisted that I start with it, and could switch to Brand if a problem.  11 days into starting it, muscle pain, joint pain, went from driving car to walking with walker and assistance.  Could not sleep at night, had violent dreams, woke up feeling distressed.  Switched to Brand name Toprol XL, after 5 days symptoms were worse. Legs had reduced in size about 1/4. Muscle pain getting worse. Went back to doctor, he took me off by halving the tablet for several days, then started back on Cardura.  I have researched the fillers used in drugs that I have had problems with, and am convinced that the fillers are the main problems for me.  Once I get this out of my system, I might try the Brand Toprol XL again.  For right now, I'm trying to get back on my feet and be able to drive and start walking again.  Still have a lot of pain. I've been told that there is no difference in generic and Brand by doctors, nurses, pharmacists.  All one needs to do is get the ingredients in generics and Brand, and compare the two.  You may have allergies to fillers in generics.",1
"Until now, I have been on a 100MG 2 times a day regiment.  My mail order pharmacy just changed me to a 200MG 1 time a day perscription.  Is this acceptable?",5
"Although ToprolXL lowered my BP the over riding comment I make is  the side effect...hair loss ...there is no mention made from the doctor when prescribing it, NOR the pharmacist...nor from the mail order provider.  This is an outrage.  I  contacted the pharmacutical company , received no answers to my question such as ""is this side effect reversible?""  Will my hair ever grow back?  Who can answer this question from patients?  Don't we have the right to receive an answer? This is not life threatening...but it is pathetic. ",3

Sour taste in the back of throat all the time. BP jumps around alot. Not one to be sensitive to meds but convinced these are side effects from the metoprolol.",3
"I have borderline HBP and an irregular heartbeat.  Started with one 25mg pill a day, then a pill and a half, and now I'm up to two pills.  That seems to be controlling the irreg hb and my bp is good.  Main side effect is I sweat like a pig all day long, which I didn't do before starting on it.  I also am not sleeping as well now that I'm up to 50mg a day.  The other side effect is weird dreams.  They aren't nightmares, just weird stuff.  I'm gaining weight too.  Will talk with my dr at my appt this month, but I was wondering if anyone else had the sweating issue, and if so what did they do about it?  Although I can make it through the day at work ok, it is a little embarassing sometimes to break out into a heavy sweat for no reason.",3
it doesn't get rid of my angina but it helps control it,3

I am now taking Norvasc which lowers my blood pressure better than metoporal did and I seem to have no side effects.   After reading about all the other people who have had problems with this drug I don't know why doctors still prescribe it other than the fact that it's cheap. Watch yourself very carefully for side effects when taking this drug.  Be aware and be careful.  There are lots of other drugs out there that also lower your blood pressure and are much safer to take. ",3

"Hi,  I am a 26 year old female that was diagnosed with severe heart palpitations, high blood pressure and tachachardia all at the same time...it was nothing for my heart rate to get up to 140 b/p/m SITTING STILL! Any physical activity at all and i felt like i was going to pass out! My heart was also palpitating just every few minutes. I was SO SCARED i was gonna have a heart attack or worse. I am also an insulin dependant diabetic since I was 8. The drs put me through EVERY test in the book, holter monitors, lab work, ekg, echocardagrams, stress test and even a heart catherization in July of this year. They could not find ANYTHING wrong with my heart! My cardioligist said I had the heart of a 16 year old! I changed from a very active person to a couch potato because i was so scared something was going to happen to me! I developed severe panic attacks and depression and was afraid to be alone even for short periods of time. My blood pressure was also running high like 140 or 150 / 90's to 100's. They started me out on Diltiazem which did me absolutely NO good and caused me to feel very tired and sleepy all the time! Then they tried me on bystolic which i had an allergic reaction to and thought my throat was going to completely close up! Then they put me on Metaprolol 50mg tablets once in the morning. I have been on this pill since October. So far the ONLY side effect that I have is that my ankes are swelling pretty bad. It has dropped my blood pressure to like 117/60 or 70 and has dropped my pulse rate to like 70-80. It has also made my heart palpitations very few and far in between! I have NOTHING bad to say about this drug except that is has made my feet swell but I can deal with that verses living every day being petrified that something is gonna happen to me! I am supposed to go to my family dr. to probably get put on a low dose water pill for the swelling! This drug has REALLY helped me! ",5

Walgreens called my doctor that I will be getting Metoprolol Tartate 25MG which I have to take 2X a day. When my doctor's nurse called me of the change in the drug, I did not think anything about it. I picked up my Metoprolol Tartate 25MG from Walgreens and try to take 2X a day. The problem is taking the second pill. I take the first pill at 6:30AM by 3:00PM I am feeling tightness/discomfort on my left should all the way down to my arms.  I then take the second pill. The discomfort I am experiencing continues and my diastolic is way up 100. I ceased activity and rested but the discomfort continued. I called my doctor and she tells me to come in and get a stress test.  I was expecting she'll make the connection to the change of the drug - but NO. My doctor said there is nothing she can do because the drug is unavailable. I get a call from my doctor's nurse and instructed me to go to OSCO.  Sure enough only Walgreens supplier is having problems.  My problem here is this.  What is Walgreens Ethical Responsibility in telling Walgreens customers that the drug is available in other pharmacies.  What right does Walgreens have in making arrangements with the Doctor to change the drug just because Walgreens does not carry it anymore and does not know when they will have a supply available.  Could Walgreens have just said that the drug is not available at Walgreens but that the customer can check other pharmacies in the area?  My doctor is not even informed of the shortage/recall-etc. I had a bad experience with the change from Metoprolol Succ XL 50MG to Metoprolol Tartate 25MG in the 2weeks I was taking it. Physicians should be more informed of the drugs.",2
I was told by a walgreens pharmist this drug is no longer available. The company went out of business.,3
I have been on for 3 month and to start I loved the results but recently I can't sleep but 2-3 hrs solid sleep then I am up walking from the tv room to the bedroom. My legs are restless and sometimes I feel like there is a frayed nerve endings sending signals through back of my head down to my knee on the right side. The only good thing is my blood pressure is good since I added the pill.  I have gained around 6 lbs since I started the pill.,4
"I experienced headaches worse than Migraines that were consistant and daily for two years. Finally I mentioned it to my doctor and she prescribed me Metoprolol Succ 6 months ago and from day 1, I haven't gotten a headache since. I recommend to those that have severe headaches to try this. It worked GREAT for me with no side effects.  ",5
"I was taken off Toprol XL  100 MG because my insurance did not want to pay fot it...

Did poorly on this drug rapid heart beat all of the time could not keep bp down,very sick to stomach....My Doctor tried several times to get me back on the Toporal XL BUT INSURANCE KEPT SAYING NO....I AM VERY GLAD THEY PULLED THIS MEDICATION....BUT IN CASE IT COMES BACK AND I AM FORCED TO TAKE IT AGAIN I AM TRYING BYSTOLIC 5 MG...HOPE IT WORKS...",1
Started med afer two ablasion procedures for Afib. Can not sleep through night without sleep medication. Extremities always cold.

"2yrs ago to reduce my Stage-1 HBP I went on Amlodi/Benaz caps and then switched to Lisinopril & Metoprolol pills after 12 months. My side effects from Amlo/Bena: sore hands, ankles, feet, joints & headaches. My side effects from Metopro & Linsino: lack of sleep, mild headaches and a sore left foot. 2wks ago while getting a refill my Pharmacy told me Metopro was being recalled and Toprol XL was being offered. I checked out the ""side effects"" listed and seen the same information as for the Metopro. My side effects now from Toprol XL:itchy skin, neck & back, swelling on my left hand & wrist, shorter hrs of sleep, & a low sex drive. Time for another change. ",2
"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOOU TAKE THIS.I am 29 have Severe Mitral Valve Prolapse so my Dr. gave me this medication, within 2 weeks I thought I was losing my mind, I started losing things, my vision was terrible I even drove out into traffic not realizing it, thank God my son wasnt with me and no one hit me. This medication was TERRIBLE!!! it also effected me at work, I lost my 500.00 camera, my sons baseball equiptment, and just started doing things out of the ordinary. called the Dr. and it was this medication. Not to mention the terrible dreams. ",1
I have been on this drug for quite some time now. At first it was Metoprolol Tartrate 50 Mg. twice a day. Then it was switched to Metotrolol Succinate oncea day. The Med. controls my blood pressure well and has also lowered my resting heart rate.  120/78 resting Hr. 68.  Side Effects may be a sudden appearance of Raynauds Syndrome Fingers only and a slight dizzy feeling when I am exercising (golf ) on a hot day. The dizzy feeling only occurs after I stop moving. ,5
very very tired,3
"The drug seems to work but I am wondering if my weight gain can be attributed to my taking this.  I in the gym 4 days/week (2 hrs per visit) and my weight seems to increase with each trip to my Dr.  Is this Beta blocker blocking my body's ability to get my heart rate into a ""training zone"" in order to allow me to lose weight?  Metoprolol may help blood pressure but increase in weight will cause other problems down the road.",4
I saw a post that gave a web site into recall and helped alot thanks  go to www.fda.gov/default.htm and look up recall on ethex  ethex is the maker of the gen brand there are a lot of recalls including this  your prescription bottle should tell you who MFG your genneric on the lable ,1
"Glad I came to this site, I have been having hives, burning spots on my face, itching you name it, I seen my primary, seen an allergist and had many test done, pills to cure it many every day, went to a dermatoligist and could find nothing, still breaking out daily, then I started thinking, all started in March 08, I call CVS to see when they switched me to the new generic pill, much larger, then reailzed 3 days later I was at the doctors, now they are most sure it is the binders in the generic pill. Went on non gen today.",3
"after switching from extend release form to plain metaporal, have experienced some side effects. I have also heard this medication was pulled off the market, is this true and if so why?",4
"I have been taking this drug, 100 mg. once daily, for three years and have gotten along well with it.  When I needed a refill(generic) my pharmacist told me that the drug I was taking is no longer being made and now I have to take 50mg. twice a day.  At no time was I told about a recall on this drug.  I do not know if the drug I have been given at this point is safe, who makes it, next to nothing.  It is very difficult to get an appointment with my MD.  They operate  like bankers.",4
"I was taking a generic form of this drug for over a year as a beta blocker for an irregular heartbeat.  The pharmacy's supplier changed generic companies, and I ended up with a different pill.  This pill caused massive side effects.  My shoulders started feeling as if there was a weight on them, and my large muscles in my body started feeling as if they were perminately cramped.  I had to stop taking it for three days, and the sysmptoms slowly subsided.  I called the pharmicists and explained what was happening. She filled my RX with the generic I'd been taking, and within two weeks my muscles are almost back to normal.  In short, if one generic causes a side effect... try another.  It may be fillers that cause the doseage to effect you differently no matter what the manufacturers say.  (A friend of mine had an allergic reaction to a generic of a medication she'd been on for three years.  They gave her the generic she'd been on, and she was FINE.  So much for there not being a difference in generics)",4

Information on the recall is available at http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/ethex01_09.h tml,1
"I just heard this drug was recalled also, and was looking for some answers. The pharmacist could only tell me it was recalled--no explanation. I have had no problems with this drug for the past 2 years I used it. My blood pressure has gone down to normal 120/80, no trouble sleeping. But now that I reread the side effects, I do see that I have had cold hands and feet at times. But if that is the worst problem, I feel that is ok. ",5
"I was taking Toprol XL 25 for palpatations. When the generic came out made by Par, I switched to that for 5 years. I recently moved & had to get my prescription at CVS.  After picking it up, I called CVS to ask why the shape of the pill was now round instead of oval.  They said it was because it was made by a different manufacturer, Ethex.  After take the Ethex pill for 3 nights, I woke up in the middle of the 3rd night to go the bathroom, walked a few steps, got very dizzy and fainted.  I lost consciousness for maybe 2 seconds.  I hit my arm against my dresser & my leg & was black and blue for a couple of weeks.  I fell very softly.  I went back to sleep & when I woke up in the morning, my blood pressure was 90 over 60, very low.  I then called CVS & asked them about the Ethex pill.  He said it differers from the ones made by Par 'cause it has fillers.  I spoke to my pharmacist on Long Island where I had moved from & he said that sometimes the fillers that are in some pills make the pills a bit more potent, & if that's the case, I was taking more than 25 mgs. of the medicine.  CVS doesn't carry Par so now I had to go to another drug store & since Par was on back order, I had to order the non-generic Torprol XL 25 & pay a lot more.  I want to know why there isn't a warning on the Ethex drug.  I did research on line & there are many Ethex drugs that are being pulled from shelves not by the FDA but by patients that have complained about them. Now I have 87 Motoprolol pills that can't be returned.  I think something should be done about this to avoid future problems.  What would have happened if I were driving? Thank you!

"Run as far away from this drug as you can!!!  I thought I was going to die on this medication.  My dr. prescribed it after several meds were not effective in lowering my BP.  Not only did this medication raise my BP to 200 over 110, but there were so many side effects that I became a different person.  I was severly depressed, cried for no reason, could not walk without being out of breath, my heart actually hurt, all I wanted to do was sleep.  However, when I woke up one day with burning in my chest like my inside was on fire, I knew it was time to get off of it.

As will any medication, some people cannot tolerate the side effects.  I have gained 15 pounds, and it's difficult to loose.  Being 50 years old doesn't help weight loss either, although it is still possible.  I have read that for some people the Toprol XL works better for with fewer possible side effects.  Toprol XL is the brand name for the generic metoprolol.  It is more expensive and insurance companies may give resistance.  Overall, metoprolol has worked very well for me.",5

"My insurance wanted me to switch to metoprolol (100 mg) from toprolol xl about 1 year ago. I am also taking Diovan HCT for HP. I lost 12 to 15 pounds on a diet in the last 4 weeks and as a result, I have experienced low HP, dizziness, and fainted twice (under stressful conditions). I saw my doctor today and he immediately reduced to dosage to 50 mg. I hope this solves my problems.",2
"Been on metoprolol succ.er 25 mg. for 4 months, at first my heart rate slowed down from 91 to 65, but now I have heart palpitations & rapid pulse again, along with the pounding heart when I am trying to get to sleep...which brings me to the horrible insomnia I've been experiencing these last 2 weeks. I am heading back to my dr. on Monday. It's a weird feeling that I feel, almost like a palpitating, my heart almost ""hurts"" - but on research I see this is par for this generic brand.",2
"This drug is the devil.. Very bad side effects.. Do not Take this drug.. Headaches, stomach aches, arms, legs everything hurts, Depression like symtoms, Please ask your doctor before taking this drug what the side effects are for Metoprolol...",4
"Have been taking Metoprolol 50mg for about 3+ years. Overall, it's seems to be working well. BP still goes up & down, but not nearly as high as it used to be. I'm also taking Benicar 40 mg. Worst side effect is being tired/lack of energy...plus it's made my ED problem worse.  It's just a ""trade-off"" I guess.",4
"i had a blood pressure reading of 199/109 with an extreme head ache ive been on 50mg of toprol for 11 days my head aches still around and my fingers/ankles swell ,toes bluish when i now cross my legs",2
I do experience ankle swelling and apnea which I attribute to this drug. I need 100 mg bid to moderately lower my B.P. W/o the drug my BP is 210/80.  With this dosage it is 145/75.,4
"My Dr. gave me 50mg of toprol xl because of very hbp when I had a kidney stone.  Since taking this drug, I have felt tired, depressed, anxious and my body ached all the time.  After 2 months, I began to lose my voice.  Went to an ENT, nothing wrong.  I asked if it could be the Toprol, he said no.  I decided to stop the pills.  Within a week, my bp 110/70 consistently and my voice is almost back.  I hated this pill and believe that he caused my pulse to go so low, that my bp went up to compensate.  ",1
I have been on this medication 25 mg for over 6 months I have gained weight and can not lose it.  My doctor just increased my pill to 50 mg per day I really want to get off this drug period and will talk to my doctor again about it.  I am so tired all the time bloated and just not right I had a angio-gram and it shows blocked 50/50 in one artery.  My heart is still racing at over 125 beats per minute and bp is still very high this drug does not work well at all.  ,2
"I am a physically-active 51yo female with boarderline HBP even on Lisinopril & Maxide, so we added a 25 mg dose of Metoprolol.  BP immediately better, but ability to exercise and enjoy it severaly compromised.  Muscles ached when worked -- probably not enough oxygen to the working muscles.  We discontinued using it -- quality of life more enhanced by the exercise than by the BP improvement.",5
"I have felt worst since taking this medicine at 100 mg. I was so tired just to walk from my car to the store.  I was so out of breath and I ached all over in my muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders.  After I stood still in store for a few minutes I was o.k.  This was happening everyday and only ok if sat still and did nothing.  Two days ago I accidently forgot to take my pill and went to work and found I was not having this symptom.  I have dry mouth at night, can not sleep, depression, sores all over body.  I feel this pill is not for me.  My Doctor ordered Toprol.  Is this Drug the same as just Toprol.  I did not have a problem when I took 25 mg of Toprol withouth the succinate.   Was this a mistake of the pharmacy to give me this drug from Walgreens on Dunlawton, in Port Orange, Florida.  ",1
the pounding in my chest gradually re-appeared and i have increased bouts of dizziness/light headedness.  i plan on consulting my physician to be weaned from the meds.  another product had almost the same effect.,3
It has controled my Atrial Fribulation. No problems.,5
"I'm taking this medication for irregular heart beats causing hbp 4 months ago ,since then I'm tired,blurry vision but the worst simptom dropping blood presure,cold feet and arms and fainting I have been in the ER 3 Times in three weeks.nobody could find my problem I had MRI done CT SCAN Xrays and nothing.I though i was going to die without a diagnose but today I found out about this extreme side effects and about this other people with this simptoms. I'm not taking it anymore ",1
"I have been on Metoprolol for about 1 1/2 months and feel no different.  I'm still having rapid heart beats to the point I can't sleep at times. I took it for the 1st month, but stopped because it was not helping and didn't realize that I couldn't stop without my doctor's consult; therefore, I started taking them again and still there are no results from it.  Can't lose weight.  Will see my doctor today.",1
Wonderful!!  My BP is under control!  This drug has done exactly what it was prescribed to do.  ,5
"I need to lose weight in order to get my blood pressure down however, this medication made my appetite quadruple. I am hungry(starving) all the time. I feel hungry, drowsey and lightheaded constantly",3
I am neausaded all the time,1
Very Good.,5
"My first medication for my high BP was Toprol XL, whick I had been taking for some years. Insurance switched it to Metoprolol SUCC ER.  I have gradually noticed my BP increasing and am having mild depression.  Yesterday, during an ENT appt. the nurse took my BP and it was 160/100.  I was shocked, and then I started my research.  My pharmacist said she has recently seen patients having problems with their BP increasing and had to go back to Toprol XL.  I am convinced that is my problem also.  This change occured over many months.  The pharmacist said the difference is in the ""binder"" they use for this drug. I will see my Doctor first thing Monday, to get me off this, and back on Toprol XL. It will take a letter/call from him to convince insurance the drug is failing me.",1
"too many side effects, shortness of breath,weight gain,gas heart burn, bloating. tired, congestion, cough on lying down.  I hate this drug.  I'm going to ween off it, on 100 mg per day.  What good is it if my blood pressure is good but I can't do anything, and can't lose the weight.  All of these medications are worse than the disease.   I'm also having trouble with the generic brand.",2
I started the generic form 2-3 mo. after mitral valve repair surgery. During cardiac rehab my resting heart rate was in the low 100's. I have been taking 1/2 of 25 mg. for 1yr. hoping my heart rate would slow down as my heart healed. I have tried several times to not take it and noticed an uncomfortably high heart rate at rest. No problems with it except that I have not been able to lose 15 lbs. that I put on after surgery even though I have been watching my caloric intake and excercising with a personal trainer 3 times a week for 8 mo. I also hoped my energy level would have been a bit better by now. I am 48 and in perfect health otherwise. I will call my cardiologist and try hard to get off of it.I hope that does the trick because summer is coming.,5
I have developed high blood preasure and have had great results from using this product. ,5
"I am on this medication for severe tachycardia and hypertention. My numbers read, Pulse:146, BP: 152/102. Since taking this, my hedaches are gone, my chest pain is gone and I feel calmer. I use to feel ""reved"". I do have some nausea, but it doesn't last long. I was on it last summer and my doctor's did not tell me to decrease it slowly and in the heat of summer I had the potential of fainting. Well, that happened. When the bottle was empty, I did not know it was to be filled, my doctor was not monitoring me well enough, even though my BP's were through the roof. It caused me to go into severe tachycardia and arryrhytmia's. So BEWARE, be your own advocate. Talk to your pharmacisit, or look things up on Web MD. That was a too close of a call for me and I am only 46 years old.",4
"Since taking this drug, I have been obsessed with thoughts of death, dreams of death and dying, sweating, pulsating in my head non-stop, and headaches.  Never made the association because I take many other drugs for chronic conditions.  After eliminating all other causes, including a brain MRI I know it's this drug. I didn't take it last  night and today feel great, woke up happy for the first time since starting 6 months ago.Going to dr. today,will not take one more of these pills!!",1
Iv been takeing it for a month now and it has bad side effects i have dizziness headaces vison problems and can't sleep at night has lowerd my boold pressure 114/75 may be lowering to much,1
I have nausea and constipation and can't sleep at night - - up 10-12 times as I am experiencing that I need to go to the bathroom due to gas in my lower intestines.,5
I love this medicine! I am on it for high blood pressure but it also has taken away my migraine headaches! IT IS WONDERFUL AND I HAD NO SIDE EFFECTS!! :),5
"I have been on metoprolol for about a month. At first, my muscles hurt and was fatigued in the afternoons. That went away and has helped my BP but I have almost daily I have headaches and light-headness. I hope it goes away soon...Any ideas that can help with headaches or light-headness?? PDQ",3
"The generic versions of metoprolol are not the same as the branded Toprol XL.  The time release mechanism does not work properly, causing extreme fatigue cycling with chest palpitations, increased blood pressure, and headache.  All of these occured when I was switched from the genuine Toprol to the generic.  When I returned back to the Toprol, these severe side effects went away.  Please beware of the generic versions of metoprolol.",1
This has worked just as well as other meds I have taken and for a fraction of the price.,5
"Is this a calcium blocker?  If this is, does it effect my bones?  I have osteoporosis, will this make if worse?",3
"Took this for PAC's.  Took TOPROL before.  The Toprol was great with noo side effects.  This stuff made things worse, caused depression and terrible bouts o heart palpations especially at night.  I quit taking it and feel great again.  I would not take this medication without your doctor knowing of it,  If you got TORPOL stay with that do not allow the ppharmacy to change it. ",2
Just started to use one month ago.,3
i was put on this medicin for a heart murmer that i had for a number of years I have had no proplems with it,4
"I honestly don't think this drug is having any effect on me. I feel NO different. At nights, before the drug, I could ""feel"" and hear the blood in my neck and head. I still do. I have been on the generic for about 2 months and will see the Dr. again and ask if anything is supposed to happen? I still feel faint when I stand up, dizzy when I lean over and tired all the time. It felt the same BEFORE this 100mg a day that I take.",3
I still have problems with a rapid heartbeat but they are not as severe and don't last as long as before I started medication almost 3 years ago. ,3
I have been on Metoprolol since June 07 for severe PAC's and PVC's.  To the point I wanted to dig my heart out of my chest to make the bugs stop crawling.  I have had tremendous relief. My BP has dropped a lot but it is still within low limits range of 90/50.  The PAC's were so bad I was a danger to drive as things would go black momentarily.  This has been a blessing to stop them.,4
"i have been on this med. for 5 months and sick to my stomach all the time and heartburn. was given it after triple bypass August,07.going to doctor tomorrow and telling him enough i can't take any more of being sick to my stomach.",1
"Helps my blood pressure, but caused severe hair breakage in my beautiful head of hair.  I went back to Diovan even though it's MUCH more expensive.",5

"Lack of energy, a loss of stamina, diminished sex activity",2
"i have a mild headache daily,unable to sleep and my tummy feels unseetled all the time",1
It's ridiculous that anyone would have to suffer to save money. I have not stopped sweating since I began taking this placebo. I also have had times when my heart races as though I'm not taking any medication at all. The increased sweating has also caused fungal problems like athletes foot and jock itch.,1
"I am another victim from this drug...this time Walgreens too.  I was in tropol for a year, week ago I went to Walgreen for my refill and they gave me this new generic. My husband had to rush me to the Hospital with very HBP...arritmia and very strong heartbeat...now I am back in tropol but after that my bp is out of control.",1
"Walgreens switched from Toprol XL 25 to Metroprolol succinate 25.  Within 20 minutes of taking had headaches, heart palpitations and sweating.   Took the remaining 29 pills back and requested Toprol XL 25.  No problems since the switch.    This generic needs reviewed further because there are adverse side effects that are not present with Toprol XL.  ",1
"Blood presure of 107/61 Pulse rate of 46 No energy, sleepy during the day. taking 50mg pill once a day",3
2 days after my pharmacy replaced Tropol for Metoprol Succinate (reason they gave me was the insurance decition) I was at work and I starting having strong heartbeats and I was feeling and looking so bad that the rescue had to assist me at work...i continue with the medication but yesterday I took the pill at 19 am 1/2 hour after i felt terrible and my bp went up to 168/110.  This pill defenitly is not good at all. My doctor asked me to stop it inmediatly and today I have to see him.  One  of my co-workers told me that she is in tropol...when she tryed the Metoprorol Succinate started having arritmia and the doctor have to talk to her insurance to put her back in Tropol. So think about it before taking this medication...I don't want nobody to go thru this situacion.,1
"Walgreens switched my tropol for metoporol er...I don't know but it doesn't work the same. I think the ER should means eight release (hours) because the effect only last 8 hours on me. before the change i used to take half tablet of 25mg of tropol and I was doing good, now I'm taking the whole pill (25 mg) and i feel fatigue, tired...must be something wrong with this new metoporol...try not to switch....try to stay with the brand one.   ",2
"when they switched me from toprol to metoprolol i started getting headaches,real bad muscle pain in legs and arms,loss of appettite,sexual dysfunctions,tired,sweating.this stuff has been nothing but problems for me.if anyone that just started taking this,make sure to keep your eyes open for the side effects...",1
good,3
"I have had migraines most my life, as well as rapid heart rate and high blood pressure issues. The Metoprolol er 50mg has caused a major improvement in all 3 area's of my life.",5
"Depression, Weight gain and lethargy are constant and yes the generic is a different compound that have more negative side effects",4
"ive been on this a short time and already notice the difference.i have angina and high b/p, so far this seems to help with some other perscribed medicine the doctor gave me while in the hospital....",5
"This stuff was awful...I couldn't sleep at night and couldn't stay awake during the day.  Didn't realize it was this drug until I did some research...weaned myself off and told Dr I am NOT taking it anymore. I have no idea whether there were heart related benefits.  It was easy to take, but the side effects for me were unacceptable.",3
depression and ankle edema,3
feeling extremely tired and listless. gained 10 pounds in two months.  Having daiy anxiety attacks after three months of use. Will talk to dr tomorrow about this.,5
MEDCO Drug Company replaced my Toprol XL with METOPOLOL which caused my blood pressure to go from normal to 100/200.   ,1
dangerous drug - hearing voices and dimensia.,4

"I was given this drug for 1st degree sinus node block, arrthmia and mild tackcardia.My ekg also showing pvc. Helps control symptoms but does not get rid of them.",3
This has helped prevent daily headaches and occasional migraines...Works good for me,4
Not enough of a change in my higher blood pressure.  Expected better.,3
"I suffered with bad migraines and nausea.  I would wake up with nausea and a headache every morning.   When my doctor put me on Metoprolol Succinate Oral 50mg, my headaches and nausea stopped, this pill has given me my life back.  I only feel tired around 3:30 in the afternoon, so I take a nap and feel great the rest of the day.  I am 68 years old.",5
"My doctor prescribed 25 MG tablets. I was taking it for 3 months, complain of fatigue. Went back 3 months later (total of 6 months) complaining of fatigue again and he told me to cut the pills in 1/2. First three weeks and everything was fine, then this wknd. blood pressure was around 100/60 all wknd. He had told me it may be making my BP to low. Back to my old routine of feeling fatigue and just wanting to sleep on the couch after work nothing else. Going to call the Dr. in the morning to complain. That is why I went online here to check it out. Now, I see all these other people complaing of fatigue just reinfores what I felt all alone that the pills were negatively affecting me.",2
I have experienced lots of fatigue while taking metoprolol.,5
"I had a ""minor"" heart attack cause by blockage of the right coronary artery.  Angioplasty and a stint got me going again.  At this point it's been a month since I was put on metoprolol and I'm struggling with the side affects still.  Dizziness and tiredness still persist.  I'm hoping to get used this drug sooner rather than later.",1
It caused major depression for my husband and he not a depressed man!!!!,2
"My prescription was switched from Toprol XL to Metoprolol. Almost immediately I began having rapid heart beat and heart palpitations especialy at night.  My Dr thought I was having panic attacks, but I was positive it was the medicine.  Talked her into changing meds.  Now on Diovan which has been less syptomatic, but still have some reaction ( Diarheaa).  She tells me that all meds cause some reaction. But glad I am off Metoprolel.  Topryl XL was good but kept having to increase dose..",2
I was given this medication when I had a triple by-pass and aortic valve replacement surgery.  It controls my rapid heart beat.,5
"I was on ToprolXL for years, with no problems. The pharmacy changed me to this Rx and I began having depression, nightmares, heart palps at night and fatigue. I went to my doc; after several tests/screens/blood panels, my heart is within normal limits, my BP is normal, but because of the palps at night and the fatigue, he is switching me back to Toprol. He said the Met is metabolized differently than the Toprol which makes it less effective toward the end of each cycle. ",2
This drug is terrific at lowering my B.P. but has made me depressed & fatigued bigtime.  Guess the benefit has outweighed the side effects but I don't feel like my old self anymore.,5
"I was on toprol up until about a month ago when this generic brand.  I have non-stop severe itching on my shoulders only.  I couldn't figure out if it was something else I had changed, like detergent or lotions.  My eye lids also have been very irrated and red.  It finally dawned on me that ever since I changed to this generic brand that I have had these problems.  I'm calling my dr today to tell her that I want to go back to toprol and hopefully this itching and stinging will go away - it keeeps me awake at night.",1
"I was on Toprol XL. My pharmacy starting giving me the Metoprolol XL. I started having the same fatige problem I had several years ago with the standard Metoprolol. Also, I did not feel it was controling my BP thru a 24hr period. I went back to the Torpol XL and feel 100% better. I'm sure the ingrediants are the same but there is something different.Almost like the medication is releasing to quickly into the system. ",2
Has controlled the atrial fib and lowered my blood pressure 20 points.  I don't have the terrible fatigue with the 25 mg er.  I'm beginning to get back to my normal activities.  ,4
"Chronic fatigue, heartburn, diarrhea",4
Blood pressure is steady at this time,4
"I had sever case of diarrhea with cramps . My Dr. said she had two other cases with the same , the only thing was are prescription was change to generic.",1
I was doing okay with the Troprol XL but Walgreens gave me this generic form. My feet have been swollen all summer and I am terribly tired all the time now. I also feel depressed a lot now. Could this be the reason for my problems? ,3
"I have been on this medication for over 7 years.  Never have they changed the doseage which is low.  However in the last year I have had stomach trouble, nausea sometimes severe and my feet are staying swollen, with burning and stinging feelings, can't sleep at nite for the feet trouble.

I take 20mg with Almodiphine no side effects after ten days tried many others that side effects were awful micardis is excellent!!,5
"I have been taking 80/12.5 for several years now,and my BP is perfect.",5
My blood pressure stills varies on occasion. Sometimes it is 120/sixty's than it will be 150's/80's.,3
"Does anyone have peeling lips and dry mouth-I feel I have cotton in my mouth every mornning and my lips keep peeling and very dry-I have been takin ghtis medication for a few months and these are the things I have noticed, was dizzy for a couple weeks but that went away..also, can I just stop taking this or do you have to wean yourself off? i don't want to take it anymore if I can help it-",3
"When I first took this drug Micardis HCT I cut it in half, which worked well for me.  It was too strong at 12.5.  My doctor agreed because my blood pressure went down.  I have been on it for 4 months and now am experiencing joint pain in my hips which radiates to my knee, calf muscle stiffness,a rash on the outside of my armpits and itchy skin on my thighs.  I have been on many BP meds.  My Dr. said I have to over look the side effects.  My Bp is 122/64 most of the time. It is driving me crazy!  Everyone has different reactions to this drug, but I am seeing a pattern through the reviews on Web MD.  I am glad I am not the only one with these problems.",3
I have been taking this med for 3 years.I have 80mg tab of which i cut in half. Half works fine for me. The side affect that i had was mild pain in my right leg.The pain went away after a few days.,4
"Have been on this med for a number of years.  It has lowered my bp from approx. 145/90 to 125/80.  Not great but not bad.  I take 80/12.5.  But as some other reviewers have said, I've had many symptoms that I hadn't been attributing as side effects of this med, but may well be: nagging dry hacking cough (the worst symptom), sleep problems, lethargy, depression, weight gain, vision deterioration, sinus and nasal congestion, closed throat (when I get a cold, I can't breathe through my mouth when my nose is clogged up and I'm afraid I'll suffocate), hair thinning, diarrhea almost every morning.  And one big thing.  I had never had a problem with my kidneys in my life, and last year I developed an enormous kidney stone - the Urol. said it was the biggest he's ever seen.  So beware of anything with the kidneys. You should also know that there is now a so-called ""generic version"" of this: telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide, but my side effects have gotten much worse in the two weeks I've been on it. I will have to get my doctor to change my medication, because now that it is available in generic, the insurance company probably won't let me go back to the name brand.  I hate the individual blister packs too.  Why can't they just put them in a bottle?",2
Was on this medication over ten years.  My hair start falling out in the last two yrs.  I c/o to my Dr. about palpitation that I believe was related to this medication. I even went to ER. My Dr. finally d/c me from this medication. It does have a lot of sutle side effects. cramping lower ext. tingling in fingers. insomnia.Bp out of control even when your taking your meds on time.,2
taking this drug in conjunction with generic Toprol (metoprolol succinate) to control blood pressure to lower heart rate.  it seems to have been effective at first to control resting blood pressure but now there seems the drug combination is not controlling as well as it once was.  pcp considering changing drug or prescription strength for this condition,2
"I persisted with this drug for 3 years,through bouts of flue like symptoms and diarreah and it made not the slightest difference to my blood pressure which has always been 140/90.As soon as I stopped taking it the symptoms stopped.I take nothing now and blood pressure is still 140/90,the only ones unhappy are the CEOs of the drug companys.",1
"HBP was the first of my ""old age"" conditions diagnosed. I have been taking it about 10 years. It seems to maintain a steady BP for me. If I have any side effects it would be occasional dizziness, and occasional diarrhea. These are tolerable compared to others.  The concern I have with this brand is that there is no generic equivalent so it is the most expensive of my drugs; even with company paid insurance, my cost just went up another $25 per 90-day supply and I am considering changing drugs because of the cost.",5

Very good HBP results but have experienced being light headed and insomnia.,5
"The only problem I will be having is I will no longer be able to afford this medications as my husband has passed away and my insurance will run out in a few f months, and I need a generic brand I can afford. ",5
ITS NICE TO TO BE ABLE TAKE ONLY ONE PILL FOR MY CONDITION. IT HAS CONTROLLED MY BLOOD PRESSURE TREMENDOUSLY.I RECOMMEND THIS DRUG.,5
DOES THIS DRUG CAUSE ED,4
I have devoloped a dry cough.,4
"Just started on Micardis HCT and took my first pill last night ...within about an hour i got a headache and it has lasted into the next day and shows no signs of letting up...it's just kind of a dull head pain...my BP has came down to acceptable levels but now i'm worried i could develop more side effects.I'm a non smoker,non drinker,almost 41 years of age,i'm overweight by about 50 to 75 pounds but i will be working on the weight problem.I also suffer from stress and eat the wrong foods.  I also have Gout.  Is it safe to take an over the counter med for  the  headache? Can i ever get off the BP meds? Some of the side effect are scary for me.I've never been very sick before or have to take much meds  Thanks and i'll post back if i have any more side effects",4
Being 58 yo with some arthritis and other neurological problems trying to remove the tablets from the blister packs is enough to run my blood pressure up.  I'vve been told it is not available any other way.,3
Worked very well for me but it is too expensive...,5
"Micardis HCT has worked very well for me , after 3 years. I asked the Dr about a generic equivalant and he switched me to Hyzaar which with my insurance is $20 for a 90 day supply.The Micardis was costing $100 for a 90 day supply.",5
bone pain,2
"Have been on this for a little over 2 years.  My blood pressure was borderline high.  I believe it has kept my blood pressure from consistently staying in the high range.  However, after seeing family members with one symptom after another from being on various medications, and reading reviews on various websites, I really am going to put all my efforts into getting off of this and my other med, by losing weight and becoming more active.  Side effects from drugs are no joke.",4
I have problem urinating and my sinuses are plugged and well as my right ear.,3
fatigue and weakness,5
I developed hives while on this drug.(40/12.5 mg twice a day) Also short periods of very low BP. I felt ill each morning after taking the first dose of the day. This ill feeling would last for 3 hours or so. Discontinued all BP meds and controlling BP through exercise. Current average is 126/80. My fasting sugar level increased while on this drug and it has not returned to normal after nearly four weeks without using it. I will not use this drug again.,4
"Since I have been on Micardis, my blood pressure has dropped drastically....My numbers have gone from 150/104 to 118/77....and I have lost almost 8 lbs. in about 4 weeks....",5
"I've had high blood pressure for about 25 yrs.  in early 2007 a 6 1/2 cm tumor on left adrenal gland was found and removed.  The adrenal gland has a big influence on blood pressure.   Over the yrs I have found that: 1 - if on more than 2 differnet BP drugs, see a kidney specialist.  They are the true BP experts. 2 - If you develope a cronic cough, it can be your BP meds, expecially Ace Inhibitors. 3- I'm on Coreg and Micardis now and they are working for me.  I've tried the generic Coreg twice and BP went up, so generics don't always work.  4- Micardis, the small pills are very  hard to open.  I've recently been switched to the larger 80mg time release pill and they are much easier.   However, not sure they are going to work as well as the 40 mg twice a day.  Insurance co made my doc switch me.  We may have to fight it, if my pressure continues to be higher from time to time.    5 - It's important to take your BP medicine.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor to try something else.  Not all drug work for everyone.  It's often trial and error at times to find the right ones for you.   Also what works great for a while may stop working.  ",5
"Within 24hours, blood pressure BP went from 162/90 to 129/77 during a 7 day period range was 121/80-129/73.   The previous medication that I used for 6 weeks did very little to lower my pressure.",5
"Was on years ago, and switched.  Now back on it, and as feared, withing 2 months have gained 20 pounds back.  When I stopped taking it, I lost 35 lbs.",3
has lowered my bp but am now getting side affects after taking it for years.,4
Doc first prescribed 25 mg hydrochlorathiazide and had severe fatigue/muscle weakness. Switched to Micardis with 12.5 mg HCT and now BP is under control and energy/muscle strength is good.  I'm taking an electrolyte/potassium supplement.  Doc needs to submit extra approval for insurance to cover this.,5
"Overall, ""benefits outweigh side effects"" for me. About 1x/wk, I experience numbness in middle three fingers on both hands (turn white) and fingers/toes lose sensation quicker in cold weather---but not a big deal. Also, I have NEVER been able to rise early but I am popping out of bed 2 hrs earlier than my previous wakeup time! I do experience fatigue later in day. I might try something w/o diuretic as I can't seem to pass up a bathroom now.   Packaging: I had brain lock at first but now find it easy to open.  Price: recommend you get ""Mycard"" discount card from Dr if you don't have; saves me about $40/mo, I think. Pain to enroll (15 min on phone for me) but worth it.",5
My pressure was high and I could not get it under control. This medication quickly got it under control and me in control of my life again.,4
"Dr prescribed this drug for BP. I took this for 5 months did not like what was happening.  I advised my Dr. that my hands were always numb and tingling when I woke up.  He attributed this to my many years of computer work.  So I continued for 2 more months until I could not hold my cup, bowl or anything until about 2 hours after I was up and about.  I am only 53 not 93. I told him I am not taking this drug anymore.  After 3 months the numbness and tingling has gone.  My bp is very good.  I only take caduet and that is working just fine.  Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.",3
Was taking Norvasc for years and had 3 surgeries on my gums.  Now starting micardis. Hope it works,4
Complaints about the packaging are surprising to me. I just lift the back from the corner or push the pill right through it. Can't think of how it can be improved. The medicine is great. I have been on it for at least three years and my bp has been consistently normal. Other meds have had side affects and my bp was up and down with them. Hope there are no long term side affects. Time will tell. ,5
"Completly satisfied with medication treating my high blood pressure last 5 yrs. However, I have developed rosacea within the last 4 yrs. and this we cannot control.  If you have experienced this please advise. ",5
"Following 4yrs of taking this rx.I have developed rosacea or could it be flushing? My pressure is under control, but the red face has got to go!  ",5
Have taken this med for some time and dr has added toprol XL and Amlodipine to control high blood pressure,5
"I have been taking this medication for over 2 months, and have had satisfactory results.  My family doctor has been very impressed with my numbers since starting this med., I also take Atenolol(2x/day), and Lisinopril(2x/day). So far so good, and I have tried walking more often so with the combination of the meds and a healthy lifestyle, my numbers have come down.",4
"When other BP meds seemed to not work or work poorly, Micardis HCT has kept my BP under controll for three years. ",5
"I have been taking Micardis for almost 2 years but never had a problem till recently.  The end Oct. I quit taking because I always felt tired.  I have tried taking it several times since them only to end up with a sinus headache, fever, chills and then I feel completely drained and sleepy.  Is anyone eles having any problems like these.",5
I have high blood pressure for several years. My pressure is under control well now.  I have suffered 2 miscarriages and just now reading the effects of the medicine. I now need another medicine to try so that I may try to  have a child before it is too late.  I have started to have  leg and hand cramps to the point of needing to take potassium daily.  My glucose level usually runs from 95-110 am to 135 highest after last meal.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone else.,5
I am wondering if Micardis makes a person cough.  I've had a nagging cough since being on it.,4
been taking for three years. if i dont take it blood presure goes up. hairloss very bad. hairloss causing much stress.  ,5
"I have taken other medications that were not effective in reducing my bp numbers. I'm particularly glad that the one pill does the work of two. I look forward to the day I'm medication free, but in the meantime, I believe my health provider has chosen the right medication for this condition!",5
"Was given for hypertension. Could not sleep, makes mouth so dry I would wake up every 15 mins for water??? Had weight gain. decided to stop taking stress less so I can sleep at night.",5
"caregiver for 76 yr old aunt.  You had better be really careful taking this med.  Aunt totally passed out, white, eyes rolled back, hospital dr said very low sodium due to many years on this drug.  Hospital dr. took her off it.  This was 2 years ago.  After few months regular dr. put her back on it for ankle swelling.  She has had dizziness, diarhea, confusion and kidney disease!  Last week back in hospital - very low sodium again!  This can cause death!  Hospital dr. took her off Micardis HCT again and told reg. dr. NOT to put her back on it!  Also many of you said to drink lots of water, but if you do you are FLUSHING the sodium, potassium etc out of your system and making the problem worse.  If you continue to take this drug drink sports drinks with electrolytes as well as water and have your sodium levels monitored.  In my opinion this is a bad drug!",2
"I have been taking Micardis, 40mg.  and a separate hydrochlorothiazide pill, 25mg. I was taking the HCT before the Micardis was substituted for other drugs that were causing problems. Took the combination for about a year, and suddenly my blood glucose shot up very high, after always having normal readings.  My hair began to thin extremely, and my vision became blurry.    I thought I had read on the Micardis package insert that diabetes was one of the possible side effects, but my dr. denies this, and I cannot find this information again.    However, the side effects of HCT are listed as dehydration, dry mouth, thirst, hair loss, blurred vision, which I had all of.  I stopped taking the HCT, and shortly after, the dry mouth and thirst disappeared completely.  The hair loss seemed to be lessening, and hair might be growing back in again.  In the meantime, dr. will not stop the Micardis because he swears it has nothing to do with the glucose levels.  So I am still taking it, but worrying every day that I swallow that pill.    I am writing on this board to caution you about the diuretic portion of the Micardis HCT.  These symptoms sneak up on us and as for me, it took me awhile to figure out what was causing them, if I have.  I prefer to take the diuretic separately from the bp drug, as it gives me more control over the dosages and necessity for them. I will go on another diuretic and see if I can avoid those problems.  If anyone has information about a Micardis package insert stating that diabetes is a possible side effect, please let me know.  The Micardis is very effective in lowering my bp, but since I stopped taking the HCT, the bp has been a few points higher, but still in a pretty good range.  I will start Lasik, which I hope will bring the bp back down.  It was running about 110/70 or thereabouts.",4
I have taken this for 10 years.it reduced my blood pressure great. but started having joint stiffness. calf muscles. feet. and lower back. felt tired all the time. I did not know that the meds were causing this if so would of quit taken it years ago. i also developed virtigo for a day when i stop taking it about 3 days after i stop taking it. now my energy is back and i will try to find somthing else that will work.,3
This med is taken with Inderal and I'm on Imdur at night and STILL have hypertension. My doctor says I'm on the best regimen he feels there is. I really don't expect to live much longer if this continues. Need advice. Thank you.,3
Lowered my blood pressure without any discernable negative side eeffects. ,5
"neck has become swollen and strange weight gain that seems linked with when first started taking this medicine.  Changing back to diovan hct, will see if it makes a difference.",5

"I have been using Micardis to lower my blood pressure for 2 or more years. It has worked effectively. I do not,however, like the blisterpacks they come in because they are difficult to peel open.",4
"I tried several other meds.  Some made me cough, some severe stomach pain (emergency room) and some did not change my bp.  This has and the cost is minimal.  I do not forget to take it because it has made a difference in the way I feel. This is a good medication for high bp.",5
"i was on lisinopril and got a bad cough after 5 years, dr. put me on micardis hct 40 mg.been on it 4 months.starting to get coughing spells again.",3
I RECENTLY HAVE BEEN GETTING A FEW LEG CRAMPS AND MOST RECENTLY I EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH MY CALF MUSCLES AND PAIN IN THE BACK OF MY KNEES.  I AM TRYING TO DETERMINE IF IT IS ADVISABLE TO TAKE A MAG. SUPPLEMENT WITH THIS MED.,5
"un-controlable hypertension, tried med for 8 weeks, no change in bp. however, swelling in ankles, fatigue, nausea, headaches, bloating, over all felling of ill.",1
40mg every morning.. some minor dizziness when standing up quickly and a few occasions have had heartburn. Drop BP to 125/81 within 2 weeks. Very pleased.. more energy..no headaches any longer.,4
I started taking this medication in October of last year and within a couple weeks I began to experience symptons of incontinence. The drug did regulate my BP for about a month but after a month or so it went back up. I stopped used it a few weeks ago and my doctor perscribed the regular Micardis. So far so good. No more incontinence.,2
"I have developed a cough, and I'm always  feeling sluggish and tired Blood Pressure still high, so not sure what to do, I wake up with Headaches and Sinusey alot not sure if these are side effects not sure how long they will last, looking to feel better either way....have to take Pravachol as well really unsure what's going on ",3
a lot better,4
Has controlled my blood pressure.  But needs to have a generic even with insurance it is very pricey.,5
i have been using it for one year.  my physician has had to increase the dosage 4 times so far.  The package is a pain in the neck. it seems to me there could be some other way to package it.  i have to open each foil with a knife or scissors.,4
I was on norvasc for my high blood pressure and it wasnt for me . I end up switched to micardid hct and so far so good . I feel better and my pressure has been lowered . with no side effects,5
"After having tried beta-blockers with no success, my Dr. put me on Micardis HCT 80/25. Fantastic results! My Dr. explained that Micardis HCT is better suited for females as drugs like Atenolol are better suited for males. Worked for me! Couldn't be happier. Along with diet and exercise, I feel better than I have in years :)",5
after changing medication to HCL started to get extreme dry skin verey bad at night?,2
"i have taken this for almost 3 years, it got my bp down to normal, but the side effects were terrible. hives and rash jyper active, dizzy, swelling in hands, happens most at night no sleep. if you take pain killers and anti inflamitory meds do not take this!!!!!!!!",3
"Recently bumped up to 80/25mg. It has worked perfectly on reducing my bp but started having some issues with sinuses, hemmroids, and gout.  Finally got around to reading the paperwork inside the box and it says all are side effects with drug.  Consulting with doctor to change medicine.",5
has controlled my blood pressure effectively,5
"This medication has been helpful for me.  I had good results within a few days of using it.  I did not experience any side effects, which is wonderful.  For the past 8 months, my medication had to be changed 4 times due to unbearable side effects.  The only problem I have with this medication is its price.  It is expensive even with my insurance coverage.",5
"I have been this medication for about 2and half years, I have been getting sick to stomach, headaches and  lightheadedness. going to the doc tomorrow to find out whats going on.. I think it the med.. ",5
"i was the guy who wrote on a review down below about my first day.  well here i am about 4 weeks later and my bp dropped to the best of 123 over 96. it never went further than that yet, but this drug is good and the swelling in my hands went totally down and i have no headaches anymore. i am going to stop smoking next week (try anyway) but by doing that that should lower my pressure back to normal. i took a blood test, ekg, a chest xray and a physical yesterday so maybe something could be wrong because of my high blood pressure , but ill wait and see. wish me luck. i think smoking has alot to do with it though.  all in all though this drug did its job. no swelling ,headaches, and i am not tired anymore. i highly recommend this drug for high blood pressure! hope this helps. take care, kenny",5
I was taking 80/12.5mg dr increased to 80/25mg it has only been a couple of days but I am tired after taking it. I will give it a few more days to see if it pass. The cost is also pricey but dr gave me a card form Beohringer Ingelheim called MyCard and it only cost me $20.,5
"Is effective in lowering BP; however, I have an increased incidence of UTI's since taking this medication.",4
may be to strong my bp went to 90/57 after 3 doses went to every other day with fairly good results,4
"just started bp 1st day 201/143 extreme swelling in hands tiredness, 2nd day bp 181/134 hand swelling going down less worried. my weight is 260 planning on quiting smoking and loosing weight 38 years old. will my blood pressure ever go down to normal? will i ever come off these pills? i am really nervous about my health now seeing what a bad heart can do. my father died 2 years ago from blockages.  this medication is helping but wish it would bring my pressure down to normal by day 2 lol. a little note: dont go off it when feeling better because when i did my pressure went up and my hands swelled again, i did have once adominal pain and thats why i stopped the meds on my own. i started again and all is ok. i feel better , no headaches, and no more hard breathing going up stairs. i do feel different on this medication. i feel that my heart is being less taxed. i recommend this drug to anyone at this point. i just want to see when my pressure will go to normal levels. hope this helps. ",4
have only taken since Sunday evening and this is Wednesday. I started having a backache and seemingly sinus drainage with a headache. I dont know if I should continue I am 65 and dont want this drug to cause kidney problems. I was on Hyzaar fo rmany years and am switching because my prescription company will no longer have Hyzaar on its formulary and the cost is over $140.00. Anyone else experience the backache and even headache?,3
"dizziness and nausea frequently, must drink plenty of water or you will get dehydrated",3
"It has lowered my bp too low.  Also feel woozy, and tired, and lightheaded.  Also, my memory is hard to access....even a word naming an object in front of me is hard to access...and I am only 44.  Will tt doctor.",3
Good for lowering blood pressure but am diabetic and my glucose levels have risen.  Dr. won't change med because he believes Micardis is better for kidneys.,3
I was severely allergic. Swelling on one side of my throat and feeling like it would burst or I would stroke out. Also very sore back and arm muscles and tired feeling.,5
seemed to develope a cough.  has anyone else experienced this?,2
Dose was increased to 160/25 and now I have developed double vision  and my left eye jumps and turns inward. I feel tired a lot. My b/p is controlled but I can not tolerate this disruption in my vision. It was helpful to read that someone else had eye problems. Anyone else out there with this problem??,2
"MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT FROM 180/94.   TO  130/76,  I'M VERY PLEASED.",5
Blood pressure normal & swollen ankles down.,5
"Kind of pricey but done wonders,had my pressure back down within three days I was at stroke level when I recieved the med.",5
"no dizziness, only slight problems when I stand up too fast.  Blood pressure went from chronically high to consistently perfect!  I have more energy now, and feel better than I have in years",5
work great from day one. dr. gave me 80 mg to cut in half. Have no side effects very happy :),5
"Feel great, my headaches are gone and no more flushed skin..only thing is I am a little sleepy on it. I am going to start taking closer to bed time.",4
this medication has caused me to have a lot of muscle movement in my eyes and hands.  My eyes jump all the time,2
"Have been experiencing aching leg pain, most of the time in the evening.  Have had some nausea. On 80 mg.  Thinking of cutting this dose in half to see if symptoms dimish.",5
"WORKS GREAT ON MY BLOOD PRESSURE.  HAVE BEEN ON IT SINCE 12-26-08.  A LITTLE PRICEY, NEED A GENERIC.",5
"My doctor first prescribed 80/12.5 to me. I could barely function, I nearly fainted and felt horrible. I cut it in half and take it at bedtime and feel some better. ",4
has caused some dizziness however my blood pressure is lower,4
I experianced fatigue and it appeared to affect my short term memory. I stopped taking it because I was tired all the time. Once I stopped taking it my energy level increased. The drug did reduce my blood pressure significantly. It went from borderline high to perfect. ,5
While taking this drug I have exsperianced painful urination and a onion like spell when urinating.,4
i have had alot of relief since taking this meds 40mg as my blood pressure was very high have had 6 children in under 10 years doc thinks that to much stress in so little time anyway cannot complain still here ,4
Medicine worked great.  Only downfall was I appear to be allergic.  I aquired a case of hives on my hands which went away when I quit taking the meds and returned when meds resumed.  I was taking 80mg.  otherwise it is the best I felt in years.,5
"Very effective in controlling my blood pressure,side effects go away soon after you get used to it,about 2 weeks for me,packaging could be designed a little better,but does make sense, the drug is very moisture sensitive.",5
"The package is a little hard to get into but I consider the fact that it comes in a box instead of a bottle, so there has to be some way to child proof the med. The effectiveness is great, I just wish there was a dose smaller than 40mg, some times my blood pressure is too low. Does anyone know??",4
"This medicine has worked very well for me, the packinging needs to be re-vamped, as it is very hard to get out unless you have scissors.  Very pricy even with insurance,  Nees to come up with a generic",5
"Fourth day of useage. second day, i had to break the pill in half to 20 MG. Original doseage was 40 MG. I felt a rapid heart beat all night after taking the 40 MG's. Past three days, using the 20 MG, I feel as though my body  has calmed down. I find more frequent calls for urination, although I realize it is a dieuretic.i have a return appointment with the Dr. next week, we will determine the results of the Micardis HC. I will be back with the update. ",3
increased heartburn and nausea,4
have bad blood pressure. But since ive been on this med it controls it. need easier access to get med out of package.,5
" It helps to drink a large amount of water with the pill. Best when taken first thing in the morning. Remember to stay hydrated on this med, I can become dehydrated on it.",5
"good med. kinda pricey even with insurance, need a generic for it.",5
This medication has worked very well for me. They even seem to be making the packaging better so that it is not as hard to remove the tablets. ,5
"The medication works well for me, but the packaging is terrible.  I have a hard time opening the tablet and when I do sometimes it is in pieces. Better packaging would help!",5
"I hate the package.  Can't get it open without scissors and then usually damage the pill. Artritis in my hands, but don't have this much trouble with most foil packages.",5
Getting the pill out of the foil package according to directions is difficult.,5
I was given this after I developed a cough on the ace inhibitor.  I like this much better.,5
"After trying several other medications with very negative results, this one is a blessing.  No more yo-yo bp readings, no more brain fog and lethargy. ",5
"Works great,no side effects!",5

I had blood pressure of 150/110. Doc check my leg and put pressure with his thumb on my shinbone. It left a big indentation. He said the my body was holding fluids and causing me to have high blood presure.Taken for 2 weeks blood pressure ranges 116/75 to 125/82 works for me,5
I AM TAKING A SMALL DOSAGE AND DO NOT FIND THIS TO BE GREATLY EFFECTIVE. I HAVE BECOME TERRIBLY CONSTIPATED AND CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE THIS MEDICATION IS TO BLAME.,3
"I've been taking for 4wks and have had severe dizziness, muscle cramps, irregular heartbeat.  I feel very strange.  BP is normal but pulse is low. I hope the benefits are worth the side effects  ",3
"I have been taking the generic Hchlorothiazide for about 1 year, and it has kept my blood pressure at 120/80 or less with no side effects that I am aware of.",5
THE ONLY BAD SIDE EFFECT I BELIEVE IS CAUSED BY THIS DRUG IS HAIR BREAKAGE AND LOSS.THE GREAT SIDE EFFECT IS WEIGHT LOSS.,4
not sure only been taking it for a week,3
"My Dr. prescribed the 12.5 caps for my consistent borderline high bloodpressure.  at times it seems to work fine at other times, when i'm stressed it does not.  i have had higher readings.  it is also a challenge to keep myself hydrated while taking this as i usually didn't drink alot during the day.  she thought this would be the best start for me and for now my Dr. is satisfied so i guess i should be also.  i take the generic if that matters to anyone.",3
can microzide be mistakeing for any type of speed in drug screen,2
"I've been on this medicene for quite a while, 12.5mg. Then needed to increase to 25mg, I noticed my eyes were very dry, went to eye doctor and he said diurectics can dry eyes out. Got off of it, switched to another med that caused weight gain and swelling of ankles, now thinking of trying to go back on water pill but stay at lower dosage.  Others do not seem promising from what i read.",3
"developed hypersensitive vasculitis, didn't bring down blood pressure enough.",3
"My doctor prescribed 12.5 mg of Microzide about 9 months ago for high blood pressure. Initially, the medication worked very well. However, at my last appointment, the doctor informed me that my blood pressure was elevated despite the use of Microzide. The doctor said that she may increase my dosage at my next appointment. There have been no adverse side effects to report. There has been an increase in the amount of urine produced and frequency to eliminate. This is not a problem as I take the medication in the morning so it does not interfere with sleep.",4
"I am taking lisinopril, my blood pressure was not as low as it should have been. My Dr. prescribed in addition to that medication the Microzide. My blood pressure with that added is under control now.",5
Have been taking for about 8 months and have had no problems. Seems to be helping keep my blood pressure down.,5
Is it possible to stop taking this medicine after taking it for several years? I feel like I don't need it because I don't retain water only in the summer when it is hot.,5
"EXCELLENT RESULTS, BUT EXPENSIVE.",5
Taking a 3 in one once a day makes my pill popping regime far simpler.I also take minipress twice a day. It worked from day one and is still effective after 3 months. It is the first blood pressure medication that seems to work for me and so far there have been no apparent side effects.,4
"This medication is good in the sense that I take one pill instead of three, I have high blood pressure that is chronic, but since I have been using this medication there was little improvement, my BP is always high and couple with side effect of dry mouth, I have to take several sips of water in the night due to dry mouth and heart burn almost every night also i went to clinic the other day i was told my potassium was loss they had to quickly gave me juice. I am tired of taking three pills at the same time that is why I stick to this medication but I don't see any changes. Also I have to pay co-payment because it s brand name, but when I was taking amplodipine and other medication they were all $0 co-payments.",2
"I have been taking Valsartan for years. It was one of the two BP meds I was on. Things were good. Then it was recalled (Scary)!!! My Doctor replaced it with Olmesartan Medoxomil 20mg. I was experiencing neck pain periodically. At first, I blamed it on working on a computer all day at work. My heart rate was different. Then my shoulders started hurting as well and the pain would radiate down my arm to the point that I was not able to carry my pocket book or groceries in the house. I would need frequent breaks when completing household chores or stop if I was walking. I blamed it on being too tired. I scheduled weekly massages and would ask the masseuse to concentrate on my neck, shoulder and upper back. Some nights, I was not able to sleep comfortably unless I used heating pads. My family and I went on a fun trip but I could barely enjoy it. I was taking pain killers everyday to get me through. I also brought some heating pads with me to use at night while sleeping. One day, my husband made a comment that he thinks it was the new med because I was never that sick. I went online and was shocked from the reviews. A lot of people taking the same medication were having the same issues. I wanted to stop immediately but because of the risk, I decided to wait until I was back home. As soon as I returned home, I informed my physician and asked him to put me on a different one. Since then all the symptoms and pain associated have vanished. My advice is, if you are on olmesartan and experiencing some of the same symptoms please talk to your physician because it could be related to the medication. ",2
"Strike one: Was taking Valsartan and I did start seeing more hair in the shower drain however I continued the prescription. But it was later recalled because the ingredients included a suspected carcinogen Strike two: Placed on Olmesartan. Though it seemed effective in reducing blood pressure.  Within a a week or two of taking I suffered from severe lethargy, neck and shoulder pain which lead to difficulty swallowing. Will there be a strike three?  No, I would rather live life fangs out hair on fire for a year than be depressed, in pain and couch locked for twenty years.",4
"I just started this BP pill and don't know yet but, the pill I was on has been recalled bc it was giving the mouse population cancer, and the name of that BP pill is (Valsartan)!!! if you or someone you know is taking Valsartan, please inform them to keep it away from their house mice bc of the risk of causing them cancer!!!",2
Haven't had any problem taking this drug. Brought my BP down with no side effects. Also generic price is very affordable.,5
"I have used the Benicar brand as well as the generic for 15 years. Due to insurance changes I had to purchase generic out of Canada, not real difference. It may have worked better than Benicar. Went on Benicar with manufacture supplied through Lake Pharmacy. They stopped that program. Back to generic for much less since the patient ran out. It has worked well for me in the part and I have tried other options. I have notice slight sun issues, not sure if it is medication. Started on this during some medical issues requiring other medications. ",5
Massive hair loss from this stupid drug! Was on Benicar with no side effects and doctor decided to give me the generic. Wow! This same thing happened when I took Atenolol and I had to fight to get another drug. Doctor kept saying it was probably hereditary and I argued until I got the Benicar. Then they went and changed it. Going back on Benicar now. ,3
"After taking for a year, started to develop an inflamed throat, difficult to swallow, and constantly salivated. I would go off it for a few days and the throat irritation went away. Did this a few times to make sure it wasn't something else. It works well for controlling BP, but I do get dizzy going from sitting to standing sometimes. I am looking for an alternative.",4

High blood pressure. Brought it down but not quite enough. Another week or two and then we'll see. No idea what the underlying issue is yet so this may just not be the right drug for me.,3
On this for several years but lately it's wreaking havoc with my potassium levels,4
highest dose is being administrated with almadapine a diauteric,5
"I was prescribed this drug to keep my blood pressure below 140/80. I take this drug as Coversly Arginine plus (2.5 perindopril, 0.65 indapamide) It has kept my blood pressure down to target ",5

My BP is just fine with this...BUT...I am calling the doctor to switch away from this due to the nagging cough I have. (About 6 months now...),5
"No pain,I am working normally,like what i was before the attack.",4
"After taking perinopril erbumine 1 pill a day, my heart beat is becoming faster and faster. I have irritating throat and cough.  sometimes I have some headache too. I was told that the drug would cause some trouble to my kidney. I would like to know how does it affect my kidney?",2
"BP is very good, 120s to low 130s over 6os.  Ibprophen will greatly  reduce the effectiveness of this drug.   ",5
side effects,1
This goes by the name coversyl in canada. Early tests show that it also can reduce the onset of type 2 diabetes. On the down side I did develope a slight dry cough,5
"I'm in Canada and this drug is called Coversyl here, same generic name.  ",3
"Took Pindolol for appx. eight months.  This medicine along with other beta blockers (at separate times) caused me to have angina so bad, that I had to take nitroglycerin several times a day for about six months.... Also had a bad cough...no sex interest...  I was also so tired and no energy..... all while the Pindolol caused me to have insomnia, and I had bad dreams when I was able to sleep.  Doctors were rude and mean to me when I tried to tell them what I was going through.  It's been a rough year, but I finally got a doctor to listen and change the pill to a different med.  Within 3 days, I can tell a big difference, and am now getting excited about the fact, I may get my life back.",1

What can I do? ",5
It has helped my angina a lot.  No longer having the bad chest pains and kept me out of the E.R.!!!,4
"Just like most beta blockers, your body has to really adjust, but this was horrible. I felt like I was having brain zaps, it made my tachyardia worse and cause my feet to swell. I also was very nauseated, felt a disconnect sensation, dizziness, etc. horrible drug!",3
"Since starting this medication I have had unexplainable mood swings, tiredness, loss of sex drive, and loss of hair. ",3

"My doctor has me on this to treat my social phobia.  He is currently studying how this drug works for this condition.  I have seen great outcomes.  I gave two presentations, and I handled other highly stressful social situations with ease.  It works for social phobia.  I was very tired at first, but I got used to it.",5
"more dizzy periods,more pressure in head",5
"Used this drug through pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Worked great. BP was well controlled at all times. I recently started on a combo birth control pill and it has risen. Have discovered that estrogen is the culprit. If this drug suddenly seems to stop working, check your birth control method.",4
"Taking this medication to help control BP during pregnancy/pre-pregnancy. It has worked very well so far, just makes me really sleepy. ",5
"I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at the age of 24 with no family history.  Pindolol was prescribed, and I have been very happy with the results.  When originally prescribed I had bouts of dizziness, but with my doctor's consultation, I cut the dosage down to once a day.  I've had no problems since.  It's helped keep my blood pressure down so I can exercise and get the weight off that is contributing to my high blood pressure.",5
Pindolol was prescribed for left ventiical rest during filling phase of heart beat.  My heart pumping was fine as well as nornal structure of my heart.,4
"Used for 2 months to try to treat my vaso-vagal type disease I've got going on (get real bad dizziness all the time). Had bad headaches eral sharp at front of my head, always painful rightover my forehead area. Also got colder and hoter faster and with more intensity than others around me. Particularlly would get ""burning up"" feeling.",2
I was on lisinopril for almost ten years and suddenly developed angioedema of the airway that was life threatening.  I have recovered and am on norvasc.  If you can tolerate this drug it is great but if you can't then be warned the side effect can kill you,5
"I've been taking lisinopril for over 20 years. Great drug, effective and zero side effects. I wish all medications worked this well.",5
had very high blood pressure and started taking this medication  and it seems like it has helped my pressure has come down a lot and i've only been taking it for 5 days very impressive  my dr. trusted this medication to work for me. ,4
I have been on Lisinopril for about 8 years and have had no negative side effects. Would recommend it to others.,5
I had a reaction to this medicine i almost died from it  DO NO TAKE ,1
I was just started on this mediciation.  I have taken one dose and it has brought down my blood pressure.  So far I am very satifyed with this medicine.  I hope that I continue to have very good results,5
"I was diagnosed with high BP 200+ about a year and a half ago. Put on Amlodopine 20 mg initially with a small improvement and later with Lisinopril at 20 mg. BP still running in the 140 to 160 range so Bendroflumethiazide 2.5 added which was the drug from hell made me impotent, somewhat indifferent to life in general and I could not venture out without knowing where the nearest urinal was and it did nothng for my BP. Now on Lisinopril 40 mg and 20 mg Amlodopine no side effects and BP below 135. Thinking about just Lisinopril as it works for me but I have to have an annual check for kidney damage. OK so far",5
Blood pressure has not been well controlled,3
"I'm actually quite surprised at all of the side effects that other users are experiencing. I have not experienced any, that I'm aware of. I have been taking 5mg of  Lisinopril for 14 months now. My BP was high, but not severe. My BP now is around the 120/80 range give or take 10 on either. I guess I'm one of the success stories. I felt like a new man once I was put on Lisinopril.",5
"taking linsopril the generic with hcl diretic, it seems to lower my BP, and does keep it low, sometimes to low, i am on 20mg lin & 10 hcl. i do get get hands & feet but no cough, maybe a tickle at times, it sometimes makes me tired & recently noticed have sexual problems, sometimes i have no erection, its killing me and i wonder if any other men have been experience this & just afraid to say it. i already lost another potiental mate because of it & trying to find out whats going on. ",4
"It was prescribed to me to supplement Diltiazem to help lower blood pressure. It was effective in doing so, but after a few months caused a horrible hacking cough that made me absolutely miserable. I couldn't even sleep. I discontinued it about two weeks ago now and the cough still remains. I'm not sure it is getting better. ",5
"I am a Asian woman who's very active,playing golf 3/week also jazzercise 3/week. On other bp med.for about 10years w/o problems, but my dr.told me my creatinine level getting  Bad, so he recommended to use lisinopril ( but my pharmacy Gave me generic) used 1week, but i could not bear  severe headaches. Also experienced sneezing, cold symptoms. I will contact  my Dr. Soon for  change my med.",1
"60 yrs old F - Had borderline high BP and have been taking 5 mg of Lisinopril per day for past month. I feel much better & it has controlled my BP, but the cough/post nasal drip may be the deal breaker on this one. Too bad, because othewise it has worked great for me. I also wonder what it does to the lungs over time.",5
For over a year the drug worked very well. I had a SUDDEN  SEVERE allergic reaction. My tongue began swelling and within an hour I could not talk or swallow. I spent an afternoon in the ER getting IV prednisone and benadryl followed by prednisone and benadryl orally for a week.,5
"i take 50 mg of atenolol twice daily, 10 mg. of norvasc, and 40 mg. of prinivil and still have hogh bp",2
"I was taking the minimum dose of lisinopril and developed a dry, hacking cough will chills and muscle aches.  My doctor told me to go home and gargle salt water! I changed doctors and the first thing he said after asking why I was there and what I was taking, ""It's the Lisinopril.  Let me give you something else!"" My husband is a diabetic and has really bad high blood pressure. He's been on Lisinopril for nearly 3 years.  Last Sat. I woke up to find him feeling his face and looking at his tongue which was swollen to nearly 5 times the normal size.  He couldn't swallow and could barely talk. I took him to the ER immediately - the triage nurse asked if he took lisinopril - we said yes and she said, ""We see this a lot!  About 50% of the people who come in with this problem (angioedema) are on the lisinopril.  He also has trouble with swelling in his feet and hands; has balance problems and has fallen several times.  I want to watch him to see if being off the lisinopril helps with these other problems!!  They should take it off the market!!",3
"All doctors insist that I take meds to prevent kidney failure since I am a type I diabetic.  Lisinipril made me very tired all of the time and foggy headed.  I could not concentrate at work, and eventually ended up quitting my job because I thought I couldn't handle it any longer.  I also experienced tightness of my muscles and tendons in my legs while taking this.  Everything improved when I finally realized it was the medicine that caused this and stopped taking it.",1
"I work in a high stress professional field. I was put on 30 mg of lisinopril, and within 2 months had gained over 20 pounds with my regular 3 mile a day walk and work out. I felt as though I was working thru a thick fog and lost a lot of ability to concentrate. I dropped off the foul stuff, and feel like I am re-involved with life again. A good cigar with an after dinner drink is better to control things with than not being able to work or function properly. Horrible stuff.",3
"I had severe anxiety after taking this drug once.  When I slept I had nightmares and awake I had panic attacks about completely illogical things (what to wear, etc.)  The doctor and pharmacist said this was a rare reaction.  I'm someone who normally worries about stuff, but this medicine amplified a casual worry till it was fear beyond reason. Doctor took me off the medicine and gave me something else.  It did lower my pressure for 24 hours, though!",4
"nagging, choking, cough",4
"Worked pretty good for over a year, absolutely zero symptoms.  Recently though can't tolerate.  Developed very severe fatigue and brain fog - as if my battery (power source) was pulled and I just wound down.  Stopped drug and symptoms stopped.  Restarted and they reappeared after 3 weeks.  Wish I could keep taking it as  it's very low-cost but the side-effects I'm encountering have rendered it intolerable for me now.",3
"I was on a generic version for 2 years of misery. Tried other drugs (beta blocker) but had terrible side effects. Went to a combo of generic lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide + generic form of norvasc. The lsinopril was the most effective component but side effects built up over time (severe anxiety, palpitations and muscle cramps). Dr. said I could be reacting to the filler in the generic version or to the drug molecule itself. The molecule in the generic is slightly different from that in the name brand. Since it was so effective at lowering BP she suggested we try the name brand version. It's like night and day. 95% of the bad side effects went away within 1 week with equally effective BP control. The only disadvantage is the extra cost ($38 per mo vs. $6). ",5
 extreme sleepiness,4
Was on lisinopril for several years.Developed a hacking cough that was almost uncontrolable. Had a retinal detachment that was NOT caused by trauma/diabetes ect. Read up on possible causes of retinal detachment and severe caughing was one cause listed When I complained about my hacking caugh my doctor seemed to know Lisinopril was the cause. He changed my meds to eliminate Lisinopril and I do not cough nearly as much. I blame Lisinopril for my de-tachment. My operation to re-attach my retina is another issue...my doctor NEVER told me to stop taking Plavix before my eye operation and of courst my operation failed! I am blind in my right eye THANX LISINOPRIL AND PLAVIX,1
"I am also taking a beta-blocker and the combination is causing me to overheat and profusely perspire for no reason. It has helped bring down my BP, but the aches & pains, coughing and lethargy make me wonder if it's worthwhile to keep taking it.",3
"I am now on my second bottle of lisinopril, which entails about 3 months.  I noticed a few weeks ago that I started with an alergy, or I thought it was an alergy. I started coughing, a tickle, then sneezed, then watery eyes.I felt nauseated and had very thick clear saliva that felt like I was choking. I had no idea it was from the pills, but decided to look it up anyway and was shocked to find out that other people had experienced the same symptoms.  Since it was July, i really thought it was an allergy. I also have swelling of my ankle, although that is why my dr. put me on it because I was presenting with high B/P and swelling of the ankle.  I will stop taking it and ask my dr. for something else.  I am also having joint pain and will mention this also to the dr. ",2
"I have developed the cough, especially at night time. Have developed allergy symptoms (watery eyes, stuffiness, itchy throat) that i never had before.  Very tired and like another reviewer said, my sciatica also has been acting up worse than ever.  Cannot wait to get something else.",5
I have been taking 10Mg a day for 5 weeks. Developed dry coughing about 2 weeks into taking the pills. Will have to request getting off this drug.  Coughing is worst at night.,3
Has an adverse effect upon sex life,5
"i have hypertension,,,lisinopril, both with and without a diuretic are effective at the proper dosage,,at least 20mg/daily,,,sometimes, 10mg 2xs daily is better than 20mg once, but the effectiveness of 10mg at a time vs 20mg is not great,,,",4
"After a month on this prescription, I developed coughing when laying in bed.  Doctor switched me over to COZAAR and after using it, the coughing not only stopped, but my BP dropped considerably to 106/70 (and maintained that BP).",3
"Mom's med Prinivil; ACE-Inhibitor. Side effect of all meds in group can cause extreme/severe lip, mouth, neck, throat swelling that cuts off air supply. Can lead to death; my mom almost DID die from this med.  If you take and experience any swelling, discontinue and see your dr!!!",3
Had ankle swelling and a very bad cough after taking for a couple of weeks.  Took for 6 weeks and cough kept getting worse.,4
"Dr.added this to my other bp meds.20mg once a day,first day it lowered my bp to 71/50. I could not keep my eyes open, heart was pounding.dr. said it takes 1 week to fill full effects. i quit after first day.",1
Does a very good job of lowering blood pressure.,5
Quickly corrected a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Have been taking for 9 months at 10mg daily dose.  No side effects. I am very happy with results. My last BP was 114/70.,5
"I have been on this medication for less than two weeks and was experiencing rapid heart beat, extreme fatigue, joint pain and other overall scary side effects.  I have discontinued, no matter how my much doctor ""promotes"" it.  Took me off something that was working for me 100% and put me on this roller coaster ~ no thanks!",1
"huge tongue, had trach",5
"I am a health care professional. I have been on Lisinorpil for about 3 weeks. I have a dry cough, sore throat,Chills, dizziness, stomach pain, Fever, Muscle cramps, heavy sweating  and Sexual dysfunction. And it has done nothing for my blood pressure.   I wouldnt touch this stuff with a ten foot pole again!",2
"At age 63 just found out my blood pressure was high, started this drug with 20mg daily, got terrible headaches, sleepy, and dizzy. Cut back to 10mg daily only helps lower pressure at a minimum. Still dealing with ocassional dizzy spells and fatigue.",2
"I took 20mg for 8 days and when I got up from a sofa and started to walk I passed out and hit my head on a stair picket and cut my forehead severely. Was rushed to the hospital where i received 8 stitches and had to spend night in hospital for observation.  Was x-rayed, cat-scanned, etc.  After being examined by three MDs was told that the problem was the dosage of Lisinopril (20mg)as it had lowered my blood pressure to low to fast. When I passed out the second time my blood pressure was 6o over 40.  Now I have a permanent scar on my forehead and a $6,000 hospital bill.  I have been in perfect health for 65 years (I jog, do yoga and tai chi)...but when I turned 65 I went to get my ""free"" welcome to medicare checkup where the Dr. found that I had ""border line"" high blood pressure and he prescribed the 20mg of Lisinopril. If I had fell in a different direction, I wouldn't be writing this review, I would be in a cemetery.  When I visited the MD who prescribed the medication he showed almost no conern (he has three offices and sees one patient every 15 minutes); hence, how can he keep track of each patient.  Yes we have a health care crisis but, at times, the Drug Companies and MDs can make matters worse.  I stopped taking the medication.  The bottom line is that the medication can lower blood pressure...but an unintended consequence may kill you.  You are better off trying to lower your blood pressure by changing your lifestyle as opposed to taking this medication.  The MD never warned me that I may get dizzy and pass out...I guess I am lucky that I am still alive as it could have been worse.  Whatever happened to the motto ""first do no harm""",5
"I have found the 'prinivil' by name has been great for controlling the BP,but, the 'generic' gave me many stomach problems, can't explain that, wish the generic(s) worked as they are much less expensive. Have been taking Prinivil for 15 yrs. plus/minus. very effective, no negative w/that brand.",4
" About three years ago i was on three high blood pressure medications (lisinopril, atenolol and hydrocholorthiaziade).  After starting a rigorous exercise program and adding more fruit and vegetables to my diet, my blood pressure dropped so low that the doctor stopped all blood pressure medicine. I am now only taking 20 mgs of lisinopril a day which also keeps my kidneys clear of protien, and i feel great!!",5
"This medication lowered my blood presure efectively, fatigue was a big concern until I became use to it. Now I am having stomach and colon problems and think it may be due to this drug, any comments would be appreciated.",5
"now I have gone from high blood pressure to low blood pressure (hypotension), dizzniess, fatigue, miserable. ",3
"Side effects were terrible.  Drug was discontinued due to incapacitating abdominal pain and tenderness, insomnia, fatigue & muscle aches.  BP came down nicely, but what good is this if you're miserable?  ",1
"Have been on this med for 6 months now and am tired of the dry cough, especially when I lay down (i.e. at night).  I've noticed my sciatica has worsened but am not sure it's related to this medication.  My Dr. decided to switch me to Cozaar but I didn't go that direction since it is extremely expensive and is known to cause the dry cough, too.  All in all, the lisinopril that I'm taking is working OK...and is kinder to my diabetic kidneys than the previous med, Tenormin, that I took for many years.",4
"Over a period of 6 months I slowly developed severe joint pain, cramping and muscle pain to the extent that I could not walk more than 1/4 mile. All symptoms dissappeared 3 days after stoppage. ",5
I have been on the medication for a little over two months and am experiencing significant joint pain and fatigue.  I am going to request trying a different medication.,3
I've taken Lisinopril for about 6 weeks and have developed this dry uncontrolable cough. My cough happens 6 or more times daily and I wake up coughing every night. I'm going to stop taking this drug and Email my Kaiser Dr.,3
I started taking this med on this past thursday and saturday night i started with the coughing sunday night i coughed all night off and on and off and on on monday.  I have called my doctor to get me on something else.,2

"controls blood pressure, but........does it cause hair loss?",5
"I'V HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS MEDICATION,  I'V BEEN TAKING PRINIVIL ORAL FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  THUMPS UP....",5
"I'm amazed how health care ""experimentalists"" experiment combining various chemicals in my body without the slightest bit of warning... I feel drowsy, lethargic and disorientated.  Been taking it for 4 days.... God give us doctors who care more about the patient then the $$$$!",2
My blood pressure did not come down and I suffered from nausea all day every day that I took it.,1
This drug had very few side effects and overall worked well in the treatment of hypertension,4
When I first started it made me drowsy,3
i have taken this medication for the last 3 months. my pressure goes up & down like a yoyo. I shall request a change of medication at my next doctor's visit. It is easy to use totally unsatisfactory,1
So far... it is hard to tell.,3
"Effectively lowered my bp without any major side effects- no cough, no rash, no change in sexual drive...",5
"Even though it has brought down my BP, I have noticed a ichy rash around my ankles. ",4
Been on Tekturna 300mg a day for four years due to HBP and protein loss due to kidney disease. Tried many other HBP Meds. Works for me. Tired a lot and lost some hair also but all Meds have side effects. BP has been 210/110 now runs around 145/70  Also take Norvasc for HBP.,5
I have been on tekturna 150mg for almost 8 yrs it has kept bp in check with little to no side effects will continue to use glad price has finally gone down.,4
"I have taken this drug for 5 years, along with nifedipine and toprol.  My numbers have been pretty good, but the expense of this drug is terrible.  I have been getting the generic from Canada to reduce my costs, but it is still is very expensive.  About a month ago, I ran out and was without it for about 3 weeks.  Lo and behold, the almost crippling pain in my toes and joints and back decreased dramatically and I suddenly had energy!  I have spinal stenosis and diabetic neuropathy, so I had never attributed any of my severe nerve and joint pain to Tekturna, but now I think it must have been the cause of a lot of my pain.  I'm going to ask my doc to try a different medication.",3
I have been on tekturna for 5 yrs have had no known side effects keeps my bp in the normal relm expensive yes but worth it for no side effect was on other meds and was always tired this doe not make me tired!!!! feel good,5
"I have been on this medicine for about 3 to 4 years now. I show no symptoms of side effects as of yet but since checking this med again i have some blood sugar problems now,but not sure if this drug has caused it. The normally prescribed drugs for high blood pressure was causing me to lose sleep as I was always waking up exhausted, I also was constantly waking out of complete sleep on regular blood pressure medicine before be placed on tekturna. It works for me. ",5
"The first time pill I took, within 1 hour I was feeling weak.  The doctor office said to keep taking it so my body would get use to it si I stuck with the program even though I would feel weak like I was going into shock.  I made it two weeks and I threw the stuff out and called my doctor and said I quit.  I only have one kidney.  I was urinating less and felt weak on Tekturna.  After a couple days of being off of it I started feeling better.  My creatinine(sp) readings are normally around 1.5 to 1.6.  I'm a big guy, bones and muscle so...I have a little bit of kidney damage before Tekturna ad the weakness and less urine made me panic so I tossed it out.  I only have this one kidney to live on.  It's gotta last.",1
Started loosing large amounts of hair and this has caused a lot of worry. Dr. Doesn't know this side effect but it's getting worse. ,3
"Severe acid reflux, stomach cramps & painful gas, salty taste in mouth, Confusion & dizziness when moving.  Disabling muscle cramps in both upper arms.  Can not lift anything weighting more than a piece of paper.  Cramps last till next morning time to take another.  But no more for me. So glad my doctor recognized these symptons.  I want to feel better soon.",4
"Cardiologist took me off Tekturna due to muscle pain,  severe hoarseness, heartburn, flu like symptoms. My Cardiologist told me that they are taking this drug off the market.",4
"Despite 1/2 to 1 hr walking daily and change in diet in 3 weeks have had a 6# wt gain.  Wild swing in BP from 111/68 to 196/111, which was part of the original problem but all in the upper range.  I was weak before but as much or moreso now, plus fuzzy brain blurry bloodshot eyes and chest and muscle pain.  Chest pain which the dr attributes to reflux, (have had long term reflux but controlled.  Overall feel miserable.   also take 2 doxytosin at nite - sllep well, groggy all day, do one chore and am wiped out.  Force myself to walk briskly 1-2 miles daily.

"1st day prescribed, early AM, BP was 164/76.  By noon, BP was 178/68, by 4 PM, BP was 194/78, by 4:35 BP at 122/74.  Frantic call to Doctor, he changed medication that afternoon.  Tekturna also caused terrible headache, dizzyness, lethargy.  Not a usable medication.",1
"Found myself with a sore throat, tired more so than usual, cough that is dry and never goes away, blurred vision and fair amount of watering eyes. This medication has done great bringing my pressures down from 162/110 down to 106/78. I am sure my body likes these numbers but I cannot tolerate feeling so crappy so much of the time. I already have fibromyalgia and spinal pain, so the additioal painfullness from Tekturna is not a welcome feeling.",1
"Tekturna has been a bad experience for me. Because ARBs and ACE inhibitors were not working so well anymore, I was switched to Tekturna. The first day I took 150 mg of Tekturna with a small rise in BP. The second morning, I took 300 mg of Tekturna and quickly developed a piercing headache (and I rarely get headaches for any reason) and felt very ""unwell"", and by the afternoon, my blood pressure had risen from 140/90 to an ALL TIME RECORD HIGH for me - 170/100! I woke up the third day with a very sore throat (which eased after aspirin). My waking BP on the third day was 138/89 (after taking 2.5 mg xanax to lower my dangerous BP the night before), but after 150 mg of Tekturna, my BP soared to 159/92 and is still rising.",1

Now the swelling is extending up my legs and my hands- to the point of skin color change due to consistant swelling... I also have developed kidney cysts and I think I am having tenden or ligament damage as I am having very painful mussel cramps or tightening in my calf... I am also seeing flashes of light from my pherifial vision...I'm done..at $50.00 monthly co-pay and the medical issues I described...it's time to get serious about eliminating all components that can cause High blood pressure...

"The worst side effects of all the BP meds,  Crippling joint and muscle pain.  Sore throat, stomach pains.  This drug should be taken off the market.",2

I just started the meds and they are doing great. My legs were swollen and now they are going down.,4
"This medication has not lowered my bp at all.  In fact, my bp has incresed alarmingly and I am returning to my doctor in a few days.  I have previously been on many other medications for bp:  norvasc, lotrel along with hcz at 25mg.  Lotre caused a chronic unproductive cough as did other ace inhibitors.  Additionally, I have a constant headache with Tekturna.  ",1

I STILL TAKE 6 MORE BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS TO HELP,5
"It took nine months and 9 different meds before my bp is controlled.  The tekturna 300+hct has brought it down from 180/100 to 117/67 in 3 mo.  Only side effects experienced have been an unproductive cough and occ pain in kidney area, as well as decreased libido. It is expensive--$3+/day, as compared to the generics, which run $10/for 3 mo. I'm hoping to be able to decrease dosage to 150mg in a month or so.",5
"Taking as part of regime for kidney failure, hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes.  Has been effective in reducing creatine and cleance rate.",4
"After first dose, I was in a hazy, dopey state; co-workers wanted to take me to the ER! My Dr. cut the dose in half, which alleviated the fugue state but left me with unusual daily fatigue, and then came the diarrhea or the constant urgue to go to the bathroom. My BP came down but not enough to stay on this medication! After five days, I requested to be taken off and I was switched to another drug without these crazy side effects.  ",3
"Have been on 150 dose for 6 weeks. Works OK; bad taste in mouth. Otherwise, it's OK.",4
"This drug has no sexual side effects. Lowered my blood pressure. I been on this medicine for almost a year now. Have taken Lisinprol, Lotrel, Benicar and few other BP medicines but this one is the best. This medicine is expensive but good. If you are having sexual problems with other drugs ask your doctor to prescribe you this medication. Good Luck",5
"This has brought my blood pressure down, however, in just the 2 short days I've taken it, my hands and ankles have blown up like a blow fish! Will call my Dr and alert them.",4

Now I can't even step outside if it's to hot and humid. I fight big time dizzy spells, nausea so bad I don't eat enough and my stomach itches too dang much. My hair has begun to fall out since going to 600mg. I was very hopeful in the beginning , but now I can't walk w/out holding a cane I 'm so afraid of how quickly I get hit,sweats,dizzy,nausea,complete feeling ill. I've stopped driving for fear I will get sick and injure people.  It's no fun. Toss in nausea Meds and my day is shot. I just started getting what Dr said is a high BP headaches.  I thought clusters they hurt that bad. Back of head feels like I've been hit w/baseball bat. ",4
"In the begining i experienced some itching in the arm pit area, and stomach. loose stool and frequent urination follow after a couple of weeks. i take this med with 8 others. I see no effect but the itching.",2

"I have had borderline hypertensive readings for over five years: up to 140/90, down to 94/72. But over the past year, the readings have been at the high end. So my GP prescribed 150mg Tekturna per day for six weeks. My blood pressure went down to 127/80, but those were six miserable weeks.  It was as if I never quite woke up. I was sleepy and in a dream state all 'waking' hours, every day, except twice when I deliberately did not dose in order to get some urgent work done. My supervisor and I had words regarding my suddenly lackluster performance at work, and this was after I took up a Starbucks habit just to get through the day.   I was so sluggish that my blood sugar readings rose nearly 100 points, on average, so that I had to increase my insulin dosage. My blood glucose levels are sensitive the the amount of activity in which I engage, and I am usual moving constantly. I didn't move unless I absolutely had to while taking Tekturna. It was a major effort just to type an email.  Then there was the hyperhydrosis. I have never sweated so profusely in my life. Co-workers were alarmed when the least bit of movement caused me to sweat profusely. I sometimes soaked through an entire set of clothing within fifteen minutes just by walking (slowly) for three minutes.  I'm glad some people find benefits with this treatment. However, I am loving life now that I've stopped the treatment and moved on to a diuretic.",4
i have had swelling in my knees and joints,2
"With Tekturna I feel nauseated, and have serious diarrhea.",3
"I was on Benicar, Diovan, Altace and they all worked for about 3 months then my pressure would go up and I would have to increase my dosage until It juststopped working. After taking Tekturna 300 my pressure went from an average170/102 down to 122/72 and remained there. I also had 0 side effects. Best medicine I ever had for HBP.",5
i like it but the results are not there,3
"Started on 150mg and was increased to 300mg... been on it for almost a year... Yes, it did bring my blood pressure down but did not realize the problem I was having was from the meds. till I started reading reviews here.. was embarrassed about having fecal leakage thought something might be wrong with me.. have stopped taking the tekturn and am now back to normal.. plus, pain in left arm & shoulder had been increasing ..felt like it was in the muscle & bone .. that has also has eased up but am hoping for it to completely go away in time.  No more tekturna for me....",3
"Once per day is good.  No side effects.  However, it has not worked on my blood pressure.",2
This med caused me gain weight and have a facial tick,3
LITTLE OR NO REDUCTION IN BP,1
Sent my review in several days ago and it still has not been posted. Is this site a partial hoax???,1
"I have read other reveiws, have have not experienced any of the symptoms or side-effects that I read about from others. Has brought down my BP emmensely. No weight gain (actually have lost weight, YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE) no fatigue etc...",5
"I will not take this drug again! Just after five days I experienced extreme fatigue, severe lower back pain, especially around my kidneys, and pain in the heels of my feet. Could not sleep more that two hours at a time. I took myself off of this drug this morning, and by late afternoon symptoms  started to subside. Will discuss with my dr.",3
It has lowered my blood pressure,1
"Many side effects. Dizzy, indigestion, feeling hazy, not sharp, scalp rash.",4
"Took the drug for 4 days and experienced heavy breathing, chest pains and faatigue. I am taking myself off it immediately.",1
"on my third day of taking tekturna 300mg,i had a rapid  pulse all day and palpitations and was seen in the e.r.the site does not tell all serious side effects ",3
"BP has been high 160/90 after taking this med. for 2 wks. I am having several side effects. It has brought my bp down but its too low now with bp of 100/50 with pulse in the 40/50 range. I'm tried, dizzy, itching, feel sick to my stomach, heaviness in chest, and a lot of pain in my feet. I agree with the person who said bp is a very scary thing when nothing seems to work. I also take 2Lisinopril/HCTZ 20-12.5,Isosorb Mono 30mg. ER, and Atenolol 25mg. 1/2 tablet a day. Also, I have been just the opposite of most patients, instead of putting on weight, for now I'm losing. (Good side effect for me)To go along with everything else I also have irregular heartbeat. Anyone else?",2
"On Tekturna - side effects after taking for 2 months gained 12 lbs, watery eyes, lower back pain, bloating, severe headaches and swollen gums. Can't sleep more than 3-4 hours at night on this med. Stopped taking two days ago to see if this clears side effects up. Looking for natural bp relief!",3
"Taking 300 mg of Tekturna caused too much fatigue, dry mouth, itching, weight gain,back and joint pain, watery eyes and acid reflux so bad I went to ENT to correct it.  Had none of these symptoms prior to BP meds. Now taking 150 and am considering discontinue med entirely.  Lowered my BP to 117/but side effects especially weight gain is not worth it.  WIll try exercise, eating right and taking no meds for awhile and see how that works.  I also take Simavastin which I may continue if no side effects.",3
"My BP has come down & I am satisfied with that.  However, I have some kind of a skin condition on my hands...dry, cracking, bleeding, hurt, etc which I have not had before. It started shortly after I started taking Tekturna & I don't knonw if it is related or not. Anybody have a similar experience?",4
"I am taking this med. as pescribed for 5 days now. No signs of any problem at this time, but expect to improve my BP.",2
I am taking 150mg of Tekturna for about a month. My blood pressure has come down a bit but I have a very bad cough. I cough day & night.also causes watery eye and runny nose. Going to dr to get a different medication asap.,3
Tekturna has brought my blood pressure closer to controlling it better than any other medication I have ever taken.,5
Have been on this med for 5 months.  Started having severe low back pain.  Doc took me off of it today.  How long does it take to get out of your system?,3
taking this medication with amlodipine and am afraid I don't have much kidney protection. Also my blood pressure has not improved.,2
"I started on 150 mg Tekturna  with good results.  However, my BP increased to around 140/100 after 7 months.  The medication was supplemented with 25 mg HCT and I started feeling dizzy with no improvement in lowering my BP.  Recently, 300 mg Tekturna was prescribed and I am now experiencing lower back pains and tenderness in those same areas.  I stopped taking the  pills for now until I see my doctor soon.  ",3
"No side effects for me, BP is well mamaged now after failing 2 other medications previously. My biggest concern for this medication is the cost of one month supply of 300 mg. tablet's. I learned it would cost me $107.00 a month. I am on samples now, but my doctor will have to Rx something more cost effictive for me. I find the med to be more than a scam on the price, shame on you Novartis. This is only medication, not a medical procedure. There are more meds out there than your's that I can afford. Maybe you could cut down on your advertisement and stop taking all those costly meals and gifts to medical professionals to ""sell"" your products!! Yes I am a nurse and I know much about you Pharmaceutical companies, been there, done that!!  Yes, SHAME on you!!",5
I have only used this treatment 1 day (24 hrs),4
My Dr doubled my dose to 300 daily and immediatly my feet and legs to mid calf became freezing and tingley and sleightly painful.Anxious.,2
"...after taking Tekturna 4 days I was awakened with a seizure of some kind...the world was spinning...couldn't move. After a minute (I guess), things got back to amost normal, but I was still a bit light-headed. I qit taking Tekturna, and now I am back on Lotensin, and after 5 days on my normal drug....I am still experiencing dizzyness, and some disorientation, and I don't dare drive. Hope this wears off...",1
it controls my blood pressure where other medications did not,5
"I immediately developed a toxic reaction to the drug.  I only took 9 doses.  I had a fever(104.6)first and took aspirin for that which exacerbated the toxic reaction and that led to renal and liver failure.  I was hospitalized for 5 days.  BUN, creatnine, and bilirubin finally started to come down and I was able to avoid dialysis.  Effects have lasted for months.",1
I still have high blood pressure 160/90,2
"I have had severe allergic reaction to every BP they have put me. Today is my 1st day on Tekturna along 25mg hydrochlorothiazide, hopefully this works with out any side effects. I had 2 light strokes 4 months ago. I don't want to lose my hair its my best feature, lol",3
"My Family Practitioner prescribed 1/2 of a 150mg Tekturna once daily, as an adjunct to other BP meds that I was already taking (Atenolol, Verapamil,Terazosin, & Indapamide), in an attempt to control an elevated systolic BP.   The first night that I took it my nose started running and my eyes watered all night. The watering eyes had stopped by mid morning the next day, but my nose was still running. I called my MD, and he was a little surprised that I had suffered the side effects with such a low dose. He said, however, to stop the Tekturna. The runny nose was better by evening but took another day to essentially resolve itself.",2
"I've been using this drug for about a year now but I recently started getting an itchy rash on my shins & inside my arms.  I also take Diavan HCt 320/25, Folic Acid 2mg,Plavix 75mg, Lipitol 20 mg, Coumadin 5 mg, Norvase 5 mg.  Could this be interacting with any of these to cause the rash?  I have an appointment with a dermatoligist next month per my primary physician because he doesn't know what's causing it. ",4
reading the other reviews I thought it was just me with the problems concerning my vision and feeling tired all the time. I have been on this medicine for 1 month and I am wondering if it is also causing me the lost of focus and attention. they really need to have an alternative or better generic drug. pricing to high,3
It has allowed me to cut out taking one other pill for hypertension,4
"I have been on this medication for a few months, My docotor included Amlodipine 5mg, now I am up to 10 with 300 mg Tekturna..My legs are swelling now with itching and extreme exhaustion. This is the fourth drug combo I have been on. Other drugs worked for a while, then.. side effects..I am changing my lifestyle; exercise,I have eliminated most meats, eating more fruits and veggies.. It has to be a better way to control this.. Why is there such an increase in this medical problem? Everyone cannot have high blood pressure without reason?, even if it is hereditary. what is happening?.  ",2
"Difficult to control HBP runs in family. Started Tekturna 300 mg when side effects from both CCB and ACE were not tolerable. Drug worked okay (BP 130/85) for first year then lost effectiveness. Along with decreased effectiveness came worsening side effects most notably pre-ventricle contractions (about every third heartbeat) and fatigue. BP readings as high as 151/121 recorded on Tekturna. Three weeks after switching medications, my BP is 110/80, fatigue is gone and heart rhythm greatly improved. This was not the drug for me.  ",1
"I took Tekturna 150 with Lotrel for one month, then switched to Tekturna 300 with Lotrel. My BPs are now 120 over 60 but I have had occasional back pain and have developed a chronic eye irritation. The drug worked excellent for me but I do not like the side effects. ",5
did not do a thing for me. did not lower my blood pressure after taking for 2 months.,1
"Have taken many prescriptions for BP with poor results but finally hit on a combo that seems to work. Have taken Tekturna 150 along with Bystolic 10 and HCl 25 for about 4 mos.  this is the first combination that has successfully reduced my BP to below 140/ 90, so I feel I am stuck with it.  However, was on Bystolic alone at first, so, other than fatigue, all symptoms seem to be from Tekturna, ie: dry caugh, occasional acid reflux, continuous runny nose.  Noticing some hair loss.  Has anyone experienced sore teeth and sores inside the mouth from biting the inside of your cheek while sleeping?  ",4
"A new product from Germany I am taking every morning: Tekturna/(aliskiren)150mg, with 8 other prescriptions. Start with it 4 months ago with other one for cholesterol: Crestor 10mg.

I'm on my 15th day of 150mg and so far average blood pressure in the 150's and sometimes spikes to the 180's. Not taking a diurectic so my ankles swell up.

"Meds brought BP down, however my hair is falling out in clumps, over a 3 month period.",4
This drug was just prescribed and has not yet taken it.  I always research new drugs before taking it.  However from the problems that most of you exhibit I will not take it.  Since 1996 I have been disabled with weak muscle syndrome and has been barely ambulatory in rehab for 1yr and 7 mths.  I am currently on leave from work because of said problem which developed from long term use of HCTZ.  Chronic lower back pain and hair loss is also present.,1

Previously, my fasting glucose was from 98-108.I exercise daily and watch my diet, with emphasis on vegetables and fruits. Are these side effects due to Tektuna?",2
It took about two weeks for it to lower my BP.  Have taken for several months with good result on 150mg taken in AM.  No adverse side effects noted with use.,4
"I have been on Tekturn for one year now. Began with 150 and now up to 300mg. Noticed water retention in feet and legs immediately, but hoped it would get better. The last few months I have experienced ""arthritis-like pain in my joints, especially my fingers, knuckles and knees -- very painfully (almost debilitating). Have experienced some hair loss and thinning also. Am contacting my doctor this week to attempt to come off this med and find something else. It has brought my BP down, but I now cannot deal with all these side effects! Took Cozaar for years with no side effects, but it got to the point it was not controlling my BP as well as my doctor hoped.",3
"This is the 6th medication I have been on and the first one that has worked.  Has anyone experienced increased libido?  My husband swears that my sex drive has increased since I started taking Tekturna.  He is not complaining and neither am I, but I wondered whether anyone else has experienced this?  My Dr. said that he doesn't have enough people on it to make a study.",4
"CAN THIS DRUG CAUSE YOU TO COUGH????? JUST STARTED IT AND HAVE COUGHED SINCE I, STARTED IT. PLEAS HELP ME. THANKS [email protected]",3

"Blood pressure still high.  Today, 154/100.  Started Tekturna 150mg, than 300mg now 300mg with 125mg hydrochlorazide?  I have to give it three weeks. I also get pains in my lower left side of back.",1
My blood pressure went up consistly from day and by day three I started to have chest pains so I quit this drug went back to my former perscription.,1
since i have been taking it i have felt more tired and sick to my stomach. it has helped my blood pressure get lower,5
BP went from 140/90 to 118/75 so the results are good.I ride my bicycle about 100 miles a week and have noticed my average speed down a little since on this med.Other than some early fatigue no problems.,5
"Im on toprol xl 200mg, lotel, 5-40mg, hydrochlorot. a water pill, 25mg, plus tekturna 150mg. before taking tekturna, my bp was riding about 170/100. Dangerous numbers.I started taking tekturna to the list of meds, it took two months before I notice a change in bp. its now 119/68. But I get a sore feeling on the left side by my kidney. My liver test has been coming up high readings. Im scared what its doing to my liver, my kidney test has been find. No other meds have brought my bp down like tekturna has, I guess this is the last resort for me, need to speak more to my doctor about the liver issue. ",5
I have just started takeing this new perscription for tekturna 150mg.After 2 days I notice swelling of my legs and ankles.Is this considered a serious side affect or just my body adjusting to a new medication.It is the weekend and couldnt contact my md.,1

"I take two medications at bedtime - Tekturna and Pravastatin.  Within 30 minutes I have paid in my upper abdomen, like an ulcer.  Could either of the medications cause abdominal pain?  Also, I have noticed blood in my stool.",2
I have been gaining weight and realized that it started right after I changed from Lotrel to Tekturna. I would consider that an undesirable side effect for any drug but especially one for blood pressure.,5
My pressure remains 140's/90-106.,2
"I was taking Zestril for my blood pressure issues, but this caused me to cough all day, and night. So the Doctor put me on Tekturna, and my blood pressure is fine, and no cough.",5
I have been on this medicine for almost a year it took at least 6mos. on 150mg to get my bp to 115 /75  it was 145/90 somewhere in that range possible higher. I do get a pain on my back right side every so often . and I can tell when I do not get enough fluids since being on this drug. To I have had a high liver readings on my last check. Other wise I have had good luck with drug. but I might have to quite taking it due to the liver readings.,5
"Im on three other kind of bp meds besides tekturna, this med has not brought my bp down at all. The only thing I get is pain on the side of my back and feeling weak.My bp is so high, it's time to go back to the doctor again.It's a scary thing having high bp nothing seems to work. Is there anyone else out there that experineces the same thing?",1
"I,too,have experienced hair loss, which I do not particularly like and will ask my Doctor to change to another bp medication even though,it is controlling by blood pressure. The hair loss has decreased my self esteem. ",4
"Im surprised at this new drug,it's a renin inhibutor, This has not brought my bp down, I get back pain and feel sick to my stomach. I really thought this would work.",1
am talking 300 mg of tekturna and  having stomache pains,2
I feel tried and sick to my stomach,2
Currently Tekturna at 300 is being in an attempt to cause kidney proteins of 2185 to fall. My experience is inconclusive at this point. Tekturna 150 for 5 weeks saw the count go from 1859 to the current 2185.,1
"So far this drug has decreased my blood pressure,one of my side affects is coughing",4
"when I take 300mg I get a sharp, stabbing pain in my left side",2
"Just a little tired.  Otherwise, it works for me!",5
"I have experienced hair loss, intense muscle fatigue, and brain fog.  At times the nerve endings in my body feel very tender, almost like a burning sensation.  This drug does stay in my system longer than 24 hours, so I am trying to reduce my dosing to every other day. I began at 150 mgs. and am now taking 300 mgs every other day. I have tried every other family of blood pressure medicines, so I guess I could say this is the drug of last resort for me. ",3
Have taken this drug for about two months at the 300mg.rate.  Feel fatigued and lethargic most of the time to the point of it affecting the quality of life.  Causes wide swings in my B.P. When it is low I am extremely fatigued and listless.,2
"Blood pressure was 160/100, when changed it lower to 150/90.I am taking 150mg and I expected a better blood pressure. side effect I get more tired than usual",2
started on 50 mg toprol xl then went to 100 mg bp was down to 140/90 ^ started 150 mg tekturna for 2 weeks and bp was down to 125-130/80-85 range. really have not noticed any side affects,4
Been on drug 300-25mg over one year. Worked wonders on my BP. But I was found to have numerous kidney stones in both kidneys. Had to have two surgical sonic blastings to break up the bigger stones. Just be sure to see a Renal doc to check your kidney functions while using this med.,4
"This med dis  work on my blood pressure,but I have had terrible side effects.  First I could not raise my arms to even turn a page in a magazine-weakness,even to bend down was horrible.  Then my knees and feet began to hurt.  Then gout in foot,that has lasted over 2 months, severe pain in feet and knees still. I see my doctor soon and am going to stop this--Lab work is abnormal also. Bad medicine!!! ",5
The diarrhea is not good for a working person; it is unmanageable when it starts.,5
"I am glad it helped you.  How long have you been taking tekturna?  It was working for me for about two years before I started getting real sick and found out it was tekturna hct causing me all these health problems like crohns disease, low sugar, gallbladder removal, fibroidbialgia,I spelted this wrong but also other severe problems.  Don't take it too long or you will be sorry.",1
"I had uncontrollable high blood pressure, and had tried many combinations of BP meds to try to control.  When Tekturna came on the market, my internist suggested I try it.  Blood pressure immediately dropped and has been under control since.  Prior to Tekturna, I took so much blood pressure medication, in combination, that I had no energy.  Tekturna gave me back my life.",5
"Blood pressure lowered from 190/98 to 117/73 within three days of starting this drug.  Was totally amazed and quite pleased!  Then, weight gain of 5-pounds within seven days of starting this medication.  (Please note, I actively watch and keep my caloric intake to less than 1000 calories per day and have an exercise regimen that has maintained my ideal weight for the past year.) Legs, arms and face showed signs of swelling on day five.  Lips began swelling on day ten.  Lightheadness and a feeling of disassociation with sporadic blurred vision occured almost daily.  Generally a poor physical feeling (heaviness and bloating) that I am not accustomed to. Have stopped this drug in the last three days and the feeling of bloating and heaviness are diminishing.  A sense of well-being has returned and my scale is showing a reduction in ounces daily.  Was truly amazed and pleased with how quickly my BP lowered...so very sad to have experienced these side effects.  Just not the drug for me.  Am checking my BP daily until I can see my doc again...so far, so good: 148/81 is the highest it has been in the last three days and that's continuing with the other two meds I have been on for years (clonidine & verapamil).",5

Since I have been on this medication which has been about a  week and a half it has reduce my readings drastically. I have not seen my pressure numbers this low since before I was told that I have Hypertension. I am very much satisfied with the medication and would recommend it.   ,5
I believe my bladder became over action from this medication. I thought it had to do with another drug i'm taking but i have beeen off of it for 3-4 days and the feeling of the bladder went away not completely but close to it because of the way i felt for the past 6 months,5
"I'm an 85yo woman, and after 8 different drugs in 9 months, tekturna 300+hct12.5mg has reduced my blood pressure from 180/98 down to 117/67 in 3 months.  My side effects include low sex drive and an unproductive cough. ",5
cannot have organism,3
I was taking norvasc which was very problomatic. I was switched to Tekturna HCT and have no side effects and a very acceptable blood pressure.,5
"The higher dosage, 300mg/25mg absolutely saps my energy. After a couple of weeks on this drug, I can barely get around, no sex drive and no energy.",4
It helps somewhat,3
"I have been on the drug for at least a year and a half. I have been overall quite pleased, but I had to reduce my HCT to 150 mg. I was literally incontinent,no control AT ALL. I am also a bit sluggish but I read that some other people have the same symptoms.  It was kmy LAST resort because everythng else mad me cough uncontrollably. so far, so good.",4
I am no longer on thisdrugit made my potassium level rise dramatically.,3
"med worked great, however ended up have severe pain in side, after $$$$$ worth of tests found out it was affecting my liver. stopped drug, liver now normal",5
I have been on this medication for at least a month .I have experienced moments of sweating  so bad i have to change my underwear. some lightheaded feeling a little faint.that last about 10 min. other than that OK. bp always seem to elevate whenever i go to the Dr.also have a sweet taste that comes and go in my mouth.don't know whats that's about. ,3
Have only been on medication 3 weeks  blood pressure has come down some. hoping a little more time will bring it down more.,3
"I had lots of erratic bp. Would spike to 190/90 on some days. Tried Tekturna  for 10 days with some benefit. Added Benicar & bp reduced to 135/70 & has stayed down for 9 months. I do have a marked loss of energy, however & wonder if the drugs are the cause? Dosage is 150mg Tekturna & 20 mg Benicar .  ",4
I took this drug in hopes of lowering my bp. After two weeks I suffered bouts of dizziness so severe I coud not stand up. I discontinued use.,1
"I had a severe reaction!  I started itching all over...thought it was nerves.  Then I started turning yellow.  I had to be hospitalized twice.  This stuff is very, very dangerous!  My liver stopped functioning.  It took a while off of this drug for my liver to go back to normal.  Please do not try this drug!! I wish only to  save anyone from going through what I went through.  I missed more than a month of work and don't know if there is any long term damage to my liver or other organs.  Please tell your doctor that you don't want this drug....there are plenty of other medications that control blood pressure...you don't need to take this one.",1

"I have been on Tekturna for almost one year. No major side effects, and my blood pressure is back to normal ranges. ",5
My BP seems to be higher Than usual,1
"Seems to have lowered BP, but losing a few pounds would probably also work.  Main difficulty is that for about 8 hours after I take this drug, if I crouch down and then stand up, I am so dizzy, I can barely keep my balance.  this lasts 30-60 seconds and then goes away.  It is annoying, but manageable.  That is the only time I experience a difficulty.  Getting up from a lying down or sitting down position does not produce the same effect....only getting up from a crouch.",4
"Female 59 Been taking this drug for 3 weeks, my bp has gone way UP!. I was really hoping for this drug to work.:(",1

"My doctor switched me from Lisinopril to Tekturna.What a disaster!BP went up instead of down.In just a few days it shot up to 180/120.Also messed up my heartrate.This junk is dangerous & should be taken off the market.If anyone should try Tekturna, be very careful, check your BP EVERDAY!After 8 days of this crap I went back on Lisinopril & BP is normal again.",1
"Does the Job. Excellent drug, not one side effect. On it for more than a year no problems.",4
"I have been on Telmisartan for several months.  It has not lowered by blood pressure.  In fact, my diastolic reading has increased.  My pressure reduces to normal or below 120/80 when I exercise and my heart rate is higher. Otherwise, its high when my heart rate is normal.  The only response I got from the Cardiologist is ""You are not normal.""  Thanks.",1
"I have been on this med for 5 weeks along with my other Bd Pr med. and I take my old med in the morning it works, I take the new med at night and it does not keep my Bd Pr down. Also experiencing muscle aches and pain and developed a heel spur. It messes with my mind and causes depression. ",1
Blood pressure is still high,1
"I take it, in addition to my Diltiazem, which is also for BP. In combination, it has lowered my BP.v",4

Extreme fatigue, body aches and pains, sleepiness, foggy thinking, blurred vision, headaches, backaches, sinusitis, congestion, dizziness, feeling unwell. And dry cough returning!",4
"I feel terrible with this drug and seems like the asthma is worse as it's hard to breathe. Generally, I feel tired all the time especially after taking the pill. The confusion from exhaustion or the drug is hard to bear. Also feel somewhere between a little and a lot dizzy almost constantly; often feel about to faint. And then there is the chest pains from time to time.  Overall, it's an effort to do anything including eat or read. I will be talking with my doctor and ask for something else. Cannot live like this. ",5
"This medication has been easy for me to use. Overall, I have been satisfied with my experience.",5
"Been using this for 4 years now at 40mg first then step up to 80mg. When i stopped (this cost a lot compared to others)  it cause severe depression. Taking it again and hope that exercise and diet helps to reduce depression. Developed muscles and joint pains too. But, true, it lowers my bp from 170/120 to 118/90 in 3-4hours after taking it. ",3

"Have been taking Micardis-HCT 80/12.5 for about 5 years.  Pharmacy told me two weeks ago ""great news, your medicine is now available in generic!""  Great! Except that where I was already having subtle side effects from Micardis (thinning hair, depression, weight gain, sleep problems, closed/clogged nose, sinuses and throat) my side effect symptoms have gotten much worse in the two weeks I've been on this - and the worst is that I've developed a dry hacking nagging cough I didn't have before that has really disrupted life.  Beware this medication!  Now that it is available in generic, insurance probably won't let me go back to the name brand, so a doctor appointment is in my future.",1

"This stuff is the best blood pressure drug I've ever taken.  Very effective with minimal side effects.  Allowed me to cut back on my beta blocker.  The limited size of pills available require me to cut the tablets into 1/3 or 2/3, which is kind of tricky.",5

"It lowers my BP somewhat, but I continue to use it because I haven't had the horrible side effects I experienced with almost all other drugs for HP.  I had to get an exception from my insurance to continue getting this drug.  The cost is high, but I think I will try getting it in Canada!!  ",3

"I was taking this medication for 10 days and then developed a hive like rash.  It ended up covering most of my body with raised welts on my arms, chest, and face.  Discontinued taking drug but ended up in hospital.  Was given a large dose of anithistamine.  It has been 4 days and I still have the rash all over my body but not as severe.",1
Have taken the medication for about 8 years. Only side effect seems to be a constant tingling in my fingers.,5
I was put on Tiazac for high blood pressure and a hyper left ventricle.  Tiazac has worked immensely in lowering my heart rate.  It use to be 150 beats per minute now it is 80 -100 beat per minute which is normal.  I am studying to be an LPN so I want my heart to be in good condition and last a good many years! ,5

Tried adjusting my diet..it has helped some.  Definitely need to drink more water on this medicine.  Will stay on it a while longer to see what happens.",5
what happens if i stop taking it?,5
"weight gain ,tried all the time ,dizziness",1
"I had slight ankle swelling but excellent results. It slowed my heart rate down too low. After about 8 yrs., I just quit taking it as it would not let my heart rate go up during exercise. Probably a stupid thing to do but my pressure has not gone up after two weeks without it. Heart rate has increased to normal levels.",5
I was on this medicine for 3 weeks before I told my doctor I couldn't take it anymore. It made me so dizzy and it actually raised my blood pressure to scarey levels. I'm on Hyzaar now and doing great.,1
"Following a 14 hr. Spinal Fusion surgery with considerable blood loss, I began having a rapid heart beat, but ONLY when trying to stand up from my hospital bed. It had been an issue in the past as well, as I have undergone MANY (20+) spinal surgeries,and I felt dizzy & light-headed following those procedures also.I had NOT been treated with medication, in a few cases I simply required a transfusion to restore my lowered blood level and some additional rest. This time, the hospital's cardiac Dr on call put me on Toprol 25, which helped, but in general, my symptoms went away after about 3-4 days.Afterwards, at my follow-up with my Primary Dr., I was found to have hypothyroidism, and he started me on Levothyroxine, and continued the Toprol as he felt the thyroid replacement could cause rapid heart beat in the beginning. About 8 months later I began to have severely increased fluid retention in my legs despite being on a long term diuretic. They felt puffy and weak, my walking was extremely limited with barely enough energy to walk down my driveway. I have NEVER had to watch my weight,and I very rarely gain due to over eating. Suddenly I began to pack on pounds despite no change in my diet, though it seemed the additional weight was restricted to my legs and feet, while the rest of me remained the same. (I am on the smaller side, 5'1"", and 100 lbs.) Reducing my intake was of no help at all, and I was tired, lacked stamina, and had little interest in my usual hobbies. I slowly began to take fewer and fewer Toprol tabs and immediately saw a reduction in the leg puffiness, and feeling of excess fluid in my legs and feet. My stamina is slowly returning to normal, and I am hopeful I will be back to normal soon in the near future.Sometimes all that's required is rest and letting nature take it's course to heal to return to my old self. Medications are not always required no matter what the issue is.Many times, less is best!!",3
After a few months I noticed I was having edema in my feet. It got worse and worse. Difficult to walk. Also had shortness of breath after very slight exertion. It was added as a third med but my pressure with it was not much lower than on my other meds. Was taking 25 mg and did not want to increase.   ,1
"Been using Metroprolol (Toprol.XL) for less then 3 months.  Experienced an immediate acceleration of Blood Pressure (which had previously been normal), extreme swelling in ankles and feet (painful and hard to put on shoes), itchy rash on stomach, excessive gas, weight gain of 22 lbs in just 5-1/2 weeks.  Had been using Metroprolol (Lopressor) for nine years, with none of these side effects.  Spoke to the doctor; he says my side effects only effect 1% of people (here I am â?? the obvious 1%), but he thinks there is another cause for problems.  Still waiting, but patience is thin !!",1
I had no idea my doctor switched me to this drug.  I have had horrible headaches from months on this drug.  They are now switching me to something else.    ,2
"Took a half of the prescribed 25mg. pill before bedtime as prescribed. Horrible side effects.  Restless, severe stomach pain, nervousness.  Will not take again.  ",1
"Started taking a couple months ago for HBP but it seemed that my blood pressure increased for awhile.  I also have swollen ankles, feet and hands, always tired, weight gain and all around fatigue.  I take 100 mg a day and 5 mg Norvasc.  I have an appointment to see if these are side effects or not.",2
"I was on atenolol for 10 plus years. loved it  but now there is a shortage of it. Doctor switched me to 100 mg of the generic of toporol. Horrible drug I had extremely high blood pressure, brain fog and lightheadness. After a visit to ER got switched to another beta blocker and back to my self!",1
"Have been on a bata blocker for 34 yrs. for MVP then AF. Now on 200 mg. BID (2 x day) for 2  yrs. it has has worked well keeping my heart rate down and regular. ONLY thing, for the last 2 days my normal BP is now high, my pulse is still low but I am having intermittent chest pain ",5
"My doctor prescribed metoprolol 50mg for high blood pressure. I took it the first time in the evening because I had heard that it caused dizziness in a lot of people. However, it did not make me dizzy at all. By the evening of the next day I began to feel bloating in my rib cage like I was just very full. The second day I felt even worse and by the third day after taking 4 doses I was so miserable I could not eat or sleep. It was like I had gorged myself and could not burp or belch and just kept getting worse. I called my doctor and he pulled me off of it and is going to put me on something else. Within 48 hours the bloating went away completely.",1
After starting I starting getting a roar in ears that was life disturbing.  4 different MD'S said it couldn't be the Toprol.  Finally found a MD to try another med Cartia the roaring stopped within 4 days.,1
"I've taken 12.5 mg/ day ( evening) for just 6 weeks. My average bp is 111/72, average pulse 63 on this. My Bp was never high. I have lost about 4- 5 lbs since starting.

"I have been on the 25mg of this for over 10 years. If your insurance won't pay for name brand the ONLY generic that is the same,also made by same company, is by Par. I have had pharmacy switch generics in the past and they same there all the same well there not. Bad side effects, racing heart, feeling unwell. Now I go to a pharmacy that doesn't play the switching game. Please try the generic by par!",5
"I am 53 years old and have been taking Toprol(metatoprol) .25mg for 7 years.  I have had no side effects at all. I have no pain and have not gained an ounce of weight.  I do however have a strict excercise program of 30 minutes of cardio 3 times per week and light weights 4 times per week (1 hour), so about one hour per day.  I have actually enjoyed less anxiety in public speaking and have kept my BP at about 110/70 (down from 140/90)",5
I take toprol lx 50 mg for years working pretty good my blood pressure is under control now the insurance dont want to paid my medication feel so upset my blood pressure is crazy ,5
"I started taking this medicine about 2 months ago. The generic bran.  Within days my joints were all killing me. I'm tired all the time, craving sweets which I don't want or need. I'm weaning off.  My doctor says it's all in my head.  I feel he is too quick to give meds and not finding the reason for the HP.  ",3
"My mother has to take 50 mg 4 times a day to get the blood pressure coverage. No matter what the dosing was, it doesn't last all day. She is presently taking the generic.",3
COUGHING AFTER TAKING DRUG,4
Works well for BP; in conjunction with other heart meds increased ED.,4
"46 yr old male. Highly stressful job as a  Personal Injury Trial Attorney. Began developing severe migraines (diagnosed w/out auras) about one year ago. My Neurologist put me on Amerge for acute migraines which works fantastic (as opposed to Maxalt which caused me to be very tired and helped for only 2 hours resulting in my migraine coming back stronger). Amerge is great. I started Torpol 50 mg extended release as i developed some moderately high blood pressure. Been on it for one month and have NO migraines. Yes, it does strangely enough cause strange dreams and after I take it, I am knocked out 60 minutes later. However, the benefits outweigh the minimal side effects. Very tolerable thus far and I am extremely pleased. Would definately try it. Dont listen to everything you read. It worked for me and you too, should give it a shot! ",4
I have taken this for years and it worked very well in controlling adrenaline rushes and atrial fib. However it slowed pulse rate to high 30's to mid 40's and doctor said it wasn't good and he wont prescribe it anymore. I will now be subject to the high anxiety which was the main reason he put me on it in the first place. Need to find something else I can take with Lisinipril.,5
"After taking Toprol XL for three years the pill is now a different shape. Each day I took the Toprol XL for six days the chest pain increased with strange dreams at night, joint pain, shortness of breath, exhaustion, general feeling of something is wrong. I stopped taking the Toprol XL and I feel great, except for high blood pressure with headache. If this continues I will go to my doctor. The manufacturer changed the formula and the medicine is making me deathly sick. What is an option for me when Toprol XL was the only option I could take????? I will report this to the FDA consumer line in case others are suffering side-effects similar to me.  ",2
"Lowered my pulse to 31, Diastolic to 64... felt cold, weak, tired, dizzy... bad stuff.",1
"I have gained 30lbs since beginning this med bp is on rise again, feet are swelling and joint pain, but depression is the worst. I am due doctor visit, I will be asking for new med",2
this medication does exactly what it's supposed to do.,5
"I have been on this almost a week. I used to be easily winded and always tired. I am only thirty years old at the moment I am writing this. Today I woke up with ease for once, didn't feel exhausted all day, and could run around at my job without feeling winded. This is the best I have felt in a long time. I am taking a low dose too because I have naturally low blood pressure 110/60 so there was not room to mess with it and I am not have problems managing as long as I keep a steady salt intake.",4
This is the only medication I can handle for my high blood pressure. All the other drugs my doctors tried for me caused way too many awful side effects. I can't take the generic as it causes me to have chest congestion.,4
"I have only been taking this drug for about a week,but everything is going well.",4
"I have been taking this for tachycardia and PVC's and resulting anxiety. 25mg. No side effects, it just works. I feel very calm and relaxed, yet energetic and ready for whatever life throws at me. I'm back to my old self. There is one pleasant side effect. I know I am in the minority here, but this stuff has a viagra-like effect on me. Maybe its just because I'm feeling so good. Whatever the reason, I'll accept this 'side effect' and make the best of it.",5
"This med has been very effective keeping my BP in check, however, more recently I have also been taking amiodarone for an afib condition.  I remained on the same dose of Toprol XL, 100mg, and now I am concerned that I have occasional low BP conditions that are causing dizziness.  I will be discussing a lower dose with my doctor at the next visit.",5
"Almost as soon as I started taking this medicine, I experienced horrible joint pain. My doctor said I must have picked up a bug but I knew it was the medicine. I felt fine until I took the first dose. I also had extreme dizziness to the point I couldn't get out of bed and missed 2 days of work. My doctor advised me to stop taking it and then 4 days later, start cutting the pills in half and taking half the dose. I was only taking 25 mg. It took 4 days before I started to feel better and I told my doctor that I refused to take it anymore. Thank goodness I only took a low dose for a short period of time. After reading some of the other reviews, there is definitely a connection to joint pain. I was taking it for high blood pressure and there are so many other options out there. Beware this drug!",1
"I take 200 mg of Metoprolol. I have a hyperthyroid and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR along with an enlarged heart. Plus on top of that I take 240 mg of Diltiazem. I do not believe that Metoprolol works that well.   My side effects are the same for the Metoprolol as well as my conditions. I feel like at my age Doctors will not be aggressive in treating my heart condition. One specialist saying it is another specialist problem. I am so young and I feel there is an issue when my father(who is in his 70's with quadruple bypass and I are on the same dosage of heart meds. I cannot get help beyond taking pills but people in their ""golden years"" can have it taken care of immediately. ",2
"I am taking this for prevention of recurrent atrial flutter. Until my doctor upped the dosage to 37.5 mg a day I still had symptoms, now I am symptom free. I was bothered by dizziness when I took it, but taking the meds just before bed now has me side effect free. It has turned out to be an inexpensive and effective maintenance med for me.",5
Every time I take this medicine it raises my blood pressure. ,1
"My insurance company switched me to this medication.  Upon taking it and within 2 weeks of start my blood pressure elevated drastically and my pulse shot up.  I started having headaches, shortness of breath and occasional angina, depression and generally felt awful! I will never take  ",1
Taking 100mg. Good except pulse low now 31 beats pm. ,4
"Heart skipping beats occasionally. No chest pain, no other physical reactions. Rx was for Toprol, but pharmacy dispensed generic Metoprolol.  Heartbeat has improved. No negative side effects. Doctor ordered an echocardiogram just in case.",4
no side effects ,4
Insomnia,3
Sorry to hear so many are having problems but to me this drug is great. I started having severe panic attacks about 25 years ago when my son was born and I decided to stop drinking and doing drugs cold turkey. After stopping the things that were keeping me sedated the panic attacks came on full force.  My Dr back then prescribed me Xanax and it helped some but after about a year it stopped because my body had become used to it so instead of raising the dosage I again just stopped taking it. I decided to battle these panic attacks on my own with no drugs.  About a year ago I went for a check up (first one in 20 years)and they got a BP reading of 191 / 99 not once but 4 times. I went to my Dr and he gave me Toprol 25MG and  Ativan 1MG. He told me to take 1/2 of a Toprol in the morning and take the Ativan 3 times a day.  I can say I have had no side effects at all and after 3 months he dropped the Ativan to .5MG twice a day and the Toprol to 1/2 a pill every other day. My BP for the last 8 months has been 130/84 at its highest and 118/75 at its lowest with a resting heart rate between 59 and 65. I have not had any panic attacks for the last year and actually feel great.  I do smoke and drink about a gallon or more of Tea daily but even with the caffeine and nicotine in my system those pills keep my BP down. I also admit I am a junk food lover and have been known to eat pizza. burgers and hot dogs 7 days a week but no weight gain so its all good.  I hope you people with side effects find a cure because getting everything under control and back to normal feels great and Toprol + Ativan do the trick for me. I admit my dosage is very small so that may be why I have no side effects. ,4
"Started generic form of Toprol XL, Metoprolol Succ Er, 50 mg a day.  No change in BP readings.  Doctor increased dose to 100 mg a day.  Side affects are horrible, tired all day, sleepless nights. Throat closing up, coughing to breath.  Thinking foggy and dizzy, dropping things, forgetting things.  Feel like I have the flu.  Called Doctor today because of side affects and no change in BP readings.  He told me to stop taking immediately.  Will see him Monday to get new medication.  I see were a lot of people are saying the generic is bad but the name brand is okay.  I really do not want to take a chance on the name brand.  This experience has me questioning this medication.  I have been taking the name brand Norvasc with no side affects.  Maybe increasing the dosage of Norvasc can lower my BP readings.",2
"back in 2005,prescribed this for high b.p.- in a short time( 3 weeks) i was into heart failure,failing heart pumping, fluid in lungs,,mitral valve issue,finally after heart cath put on lasix and off the ToprolXL-took months but gradually improved greatly-almost 9 yrs and was doing well-  about 6 weeks ago, took 2 Aleve( new to me)next day, back into heart failure again- fluid in lungs, legs swelled, pain in chest, not coming out of it-now on lasix again, seeing a cardio at Hopkins- anyone else had this reaction from meds prescribed like beta blockers or over the counter? diagnosed w/ congestive heart failure, told i now need surgery- all this now from Aleve/naprozen. anyone else have this happen? allergic reaction?",1
it's really hard to measure it because i am taking it with so many other drugs,3
"I have slowly developed moderately high blood pressure but the most irritating thing I had was a 'flutter' in my heart beat.  I could feel it but the doc said it wasn't anything serious, just an extra half beat.  He put me on minimum dose of Toprol (25mg) and my flutter is gone, BP is perfect.  Can't detect any side effects.  Been on it for about 3 yrs.  Works great for my purposes.",5
"I developed high bp after developing trigeminal neuralgia 13 yrs. ago.  I am furious at docs now, because I suffer from depression, that is the first side effect of this drug!  That, and i was a gym rat before I got sick. Have tried cardio for the past 5 months and cannot get my heart rate up.... so finally checked more into this drug.  No wonder! Am going to doc tomorrow for new rx on something, but honestly, shouldn't someone know about this drug, given my propensity to depression and fatigue due to pain??",2
I HAVE USED THIS FOR 8 YEARS WITH FEW SIDE AFFECTS BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN CAUSING SOME ED! I AM 65!,4
Originally I was on 12.5mg Carvedilol 2X daily. BP then averaged 115/75.  BP average with Metoprolol XL (50mg 2X daily) has been 122/83. I'll monitor BP for the next couple months and then decide if it works for me.,2
"I have been on Toprol XL for 10 years now. Since the beginning had weight gain, hair loss, aches/joint pain, chest pains, swelling of ankles/feet, low sex drive and ED as well as saying ""that I had to think of having to breathe"" no one would believe me of any of these side effects. Now the DR. claims I have COPD (and no COPD meds work to help my breathing - something's wrong with that, could it be the Toprol)? tingling in toes most of the time, now irregular heartbeat and still have low sex drive, ED, swelling and tired all the time!!! Hummm Just switched to Metoprolol for cost purposes this week, first thing I noticed heavy chest was hoping for better breathing!!!  We'll see if anything changes?",3
"Works well for controlling episodes of rapid heartbeat, but has done nothing for migraines. I'm always tired from it, and cognitive function is impaired. ",1
"I wish my doctors would have never put me on this med, sex life is gone and they do not care. I hate this drug I hate it.",1
This is a Pretty okay drug for High Blood Pressure!I do have to take Sotalol as well for my Tachycardia.Plus I have no problems with side effects or anything.,3
keep me awake ,2
developed severe joint and muscle ache can't trace it to anything else.,2
had trouble breathing.,2
"After an episode of atrial fibrillation my Dr. changed my medication from Tenormin, which I had been taking for 35 years to Toprol.  I have been taking Toprol for 3 years now and have had only one side effect - fullness around my middle. Heart rate is 42-55 but do not feel fatigued.",4
lower stomach pains,4
"I have been on this drug for 15 years. I was on Toprol XL first, and then went on the generic metoprolol 50mg. I am really surprised to hear about the ""weight gain"" complaints, because my weight has stayed the same, the whole time. Another complaint was ""sluggishness"" I am tired for about 2 hours after taking this drug, and then it passes, and I am 100% ok.  I also take Yoga classes 3 times a week, and do some treadmill. I am on this medication because of Mitral valve problems, and I have been very satisfied with the drug.",5
"This med has brought my BP down but I have been to the doc several times for a severe itch, all over my body. I cant sleep for it. Will most likely discontinue use. ",3
Living normally.,4
"Use this drug to control SVT. I'm younger and smaller than most patients, but am on a very high dose (125mg daily). Although it does work well controlling my rhythms, it makes me SO tired that I can barely make it through work and school. Unfortunately I have been on most other meds that can control rhythm problems and this is the only one that works. Side effects of severe tiredness and mental fog are horrible. I've been taking it since I was 16 and am now 23.",4
"This medication should be taken off the market. At least the generic version. From day one on 25 mg I experienced dizziness and foggy head. I stuck with it thinking effects would disappear. As weeks passed I was constantly itchy, fatigued and I would wake up with such awfull joint pain and heavy legs. I would have to take Motrin to survive the day. I walked around like a zombie all day and could not concentrate at work. I was so tired could barely exercise. I was gaining weight rapidly epecially in the middle and my legs and feet swollen always. Then I started noticing the lack of sexual desire and I was totally unable to reach orgasm. At this point I decided I would taper myself off it slowly an monitor my bp. I have been exercising and eating well, taking natural supplements for bp. My doctor would not support my decision, which further increased my lack of confidence in out medical system. After about 2 months off this poison I'm finally feeling like myself again. On about day 3 I was going to the bathroom frequently and releasing a lot of fluid retention. Please ask your doctor for an alternative. This is pure poison and will severely decrease your quality of life. At 48 I was feelin more like 85.",1
Excellent  but medicare like to substitute for metropolol that is bad for me.,5
"Have been on 50mg at night for a little over a year. Also take Lisinipril for high bp. Bp goes down to 95/58 at times. Have the weird vivid dreams, sob (but I also have emphysema so didn't really notice), always sleepy (need a nap after sleeping 10 hours at night). Need to discuss discontinuing drug with doctor. ",1
I have had chronic back pain my entire life.  Starting in 2008 I have had 4 spinal fusion surgeries and one neurostimulator implant plus a heart attack.  It has been three years since my heart attack and for the first 34 months after the heart attack I would end up going to the hospital at least once a month because I felt like I was having a heart attack.  And two months ago my cardiologist started me on 1/2 of a 25 mg tablet per day and all my chest pain and fake heart attacks stopped.  It is like it was before my heart attack.  This is a great medicine.  I tried to take nitrates before but I had very severe headaches so I couldn't take them.  This has no side effects and it works great.,5
I take 100mg each day & it does work very well. If I miss a dose I will start to get a headache. It has helped me very much. No side effects.,5
"I had a minithoracotomy on 5/8/2012 (Cnaton, Ohio at the Aultman Hospital) for an enlarged heart.  Was on 200mg of Metoprolol Succinate per day. After surgery 25mg. I did gain some weight but can now exercise. 2hrs Mon-Thurs and 1hr Sat-Sun. The only side effects I have are oily face (not sure that's so bad) and feeling fatigued (not so much now that I am working out.) Oh and my hands falls asleep while lying down. I LOVE LIFE!  ",5
I have been taking this drug for two plus weeks and my joints and muscles are so painful that I can hardly walk. I am also feeling very tired if I try to do any continuous walking. This medication is not one that I would ever use again.,1

Droped my blood pressure to low.,2
it works whill the others do not,5
"While effective controlling my ventricular tachycardia along with my implanted defibralator the 10 lb weight gain in one year, fatigue, depression, personality changes and extremely cold ands and feet along with my hair falling out is NOT worth it.  Unfortunately my condition is not due to cardiac disease per se, but rather a ""spot"" which developed on the top outside of my heart and is not reachable to ablate.  It is casing electrical malfunction that is potentially fatal, meds to control this other than beta blkrs have worse, some fatal, side effects.  I am very upset..  Hate this drug.  Has ruined my quality of life, I go nowhere. ",4

"I experienced shortness of breath, fatigue, weight gain due to fluid retention and a pulse of 40 per minute. I eventually became bed ridden and had Congestive Heart Failure.  My doctor stopped the med. and after 3 days started to release almost 18 lbs. of fluid and started to feel better.",1

overall good ..but feel colder in the winter ...get numb faster...some unlevel feeling years after taking ...just changed to bystolic a few months ago cause doc thought my body was not responding to toprol xl anymore ...but now doc has decided for me to get back on Toprol again ..he thinks it fits my description of symptoms better...i have low blood pressure issues and heart fluttering ...  ,4
this drug lowers my heart rate and my blood pressure. I am very happy with this drug and so is my Dr.,5

"I was givin the medication by the Doctor, so I use it",3
"This was the second time the doctor put my husband back on Toprol. Both times he had severe confusion, extreme tiredness,almost comatose, weight gain of 10 lbs in feet and legs in one week, fluid on the lungs that had to be drained. The first time required hospitalization with IV meds to get the 30 lbs of fluid off of him quickly.This is a bad drug.",1
"I've also noticed weight gain or should I say ""not able to lose unwanted pounds"". I also take an additional BP med plus irregular heart beat meds.  My BP is in the normal range and I haven't had any accurances of irregular heart function.  If I miss a day, I can tell immediately when I get up the next morning.  What a Great Reminder.When you get close to 70, we need all the reminders we can get!",4
"I take this medication at bedtime, I think to control my blood pressure overnight. I always check my blood pressure the first thing in the morning and the diastolic pressure is usually above 90 psi. I then take Norvasc and usually go for a walk, which brings my pressures down to a normal or near-normal level. I have also experienced atrial fibrillation and this is perhaps the main reason my cardiologist has me on this medication.",3
"I have been on this medication 100mg once a day for over 10 years and it works for me.  Of course, I had side effects when I was first started it, but they went away after about two weeks.  If I had side effects like some of these other users, I would have run to my dr's office and asked for it to be changed.  I have been on several different ones, and this is the only one that has worked for me.  I will NOT use the generic form though.",5

"I was prescribed this medication for Complex Migraines and high blood pressure. Worst med i have ever taken! I couldn't sleep, had nightmares when i did get sleep with dreams of monsters and gremlins. It progressed to a bout of very severe depression with panic attacks, disorientation, night terrors, and severe mental incomprehension. Was prescribed Tenormin after this with the same horrible results. Had to take Paxil to relieve this horrible experience which took 5 months to get back to normal.",2
"Changed doctor and my new doctor says this is not a drug for high blood pressure.  Says it more of a Heart drug then high blood pressure.

"I am experiencing weakness, and tingling in my lower extremities, pain in my legs and in my shoulders. I don't like the feeling this drug makes me have.

"I have been taking Metoprolol for about a year now.  I don't think it has helped with HBP but it seems to help with heart palipitations.  The side effects are not good though.  Fatigue, weight gain (20lbs in year), sexual side effects, dizziness, shortness of breath.  It's hard to exercise because of this! I am so frustrated! Sometimes I wonder if the meds are CAUSING the palpitations.....",2
weight gain of at least 30 lbs. also developed hallucinations such as a spider on wall and a bat at the window . really scary. was taken off this drug symtoms disapeared,4
"Take generic metoprolol and it seems to work for lowering my BP.  Have had continual weight gain of almost 50 lbs, terrible probs with bloating, with stomach and with constipation since starting BP meds about 6 years ago. Had severe Afib attack landed me in ER and BP meds have helped. Docs say no way BP meds cause any of these symptoms but I don't agree.  I've also had issues with dry throat and hoarseness in my voice and for that one they do agree and have changed me to different meds until found one that causes least hoarseness.  Overall it keeps my BP down which is good but at the cost of now having other things to deal with.  ",4
I have only been on this RX for a little over a week for high BP and I am so tired that I cannot stand it. I have a hard time gettign up in the morning and very vivid dreams that awake me during the night.

"My mother had a heart attack;dr put her on toprol, didn't work so he kept increasing to point of a 300lb man - she was @100lbs. We monitored BP before & after med - higher after med. Monitored her BP at least 7 times a day, at rest, sitting (legs not crossed) standing, laying down before and after meals, am & pm. Toprol made her worse. She was taken off it abruptly and within 30 days had nightmare hallucinations of my father being murdered and he was also the murderer when she looked at him at times - other times she remembered him. After 10 horrible months we had to put her in a nursing home which was also a horrible nightmare. This is a dangerous drug and that side effect, hallucinations, while well known is not listed on the materials you receive - only after researching did I find that.  It dramatically reduced her quality of life.",1

"I began reading reviews of all my medications because of steady weight gain despite exercise and a healthy diet.  I've been on this drug about 2 years and have gained almost 15 lbs. Which is a lot if you are 5' 1"".  My BP is now within healthy range.  So, which is more life-threatening, high BP or obesity!",4
Had touch of Afib and XL smoothed it out. BP at or near normal most days,5
I have taken this med for almost 4 years. It keeps my blood pressure down but with side effects that have gotten worse over time. 1. Weight gain. 2. Acid reflux 3. Lower distress. May be time for a change. ,3
My experience with this medication has been more negative then good. I feel worse if I take the medication then if I don't. The long term effects of the medication are far worse then the ill. My latest negitive side effect is blured vision in my left eye. I think the meds are going to kill me before my illness.,2
"I have gained 30+ pounds in a year's time. The hot flashes are horrible. Especially at night. It doesn't take much to upset me.I cry over silly things people say to me. I mean like elephant tears. My toes feel numb at times.  When I sit down, I bounce my legs up and down. The lower number on my blood pressure ranges from the high 80's to lower 90's.  I take 50 mg/per day.  I just want to be okay again. ",2
"I haven't tried it yet,I just got it so I will be taking it in the morning. I was just trying to get more info on this medication because I never took any high blood pressure medicine that makes you dizzy.",1
When I first started taking it I broke out in hives.  Also very tired,3
"50 mm XL daily, and BP is down to 130's/70's, pulse in the low 60's BPM, and no other issues. Maybe some of you negative posters work for other drug companies, so tell the truth. This drug works for me, and will you too if needed and Rx'd by your Doctor.",5
I have been on Troprol XL (now the generic) for about 5 yrs and my weight has continually gone up. Having a 3 by-pass 14 yrs ago I don't dare not follow my DR.'s orders but no one understands that dieting doesn't help with the weight gain. Til I saw this site I thought it was just me.,3
"JoAnn,how long have you been taking toprol xl?The doctors usually say it can take a couple of weeks to work, How many mg are you on? Maybe you need to give doctors office a call and let them know how you are doing on this.",5
"I take this drug 2 times a day, 25 mg. both times.  It makes me very tired and I get cold much more often than I did prior to starting this medication.  I do have difficulty with light headedness, also",4
"Some light headeness, Sleepiness.",3
lowered my bp and controls afib,4
"my b/p is still 180/81 sometimes down as low as 166/79 I don't think it is working.  What can I do naturally to lower it.  Will walking help?  Should I stay quite and rest?   Thank you, JoAnn",3
"Toporal XL is said to be a ""beta blocker"".  I was given it for Isolated Systolic Hypertention.   Seems to be working well. No side effects so far.  Formerly I was on Lanoxicaps .05 mg per day.",4
This medication has been veryy successful iin lowering my blood pressure.,5
"I was on another Beta blocker that wasn't working and was lowering my heart rate in the low 50's. Also the erratic heart beat that I had had turned into my heart skipping a beat when the heart doctor ran a echo gram. Have been on 50mg of Metoprol KL for 4 months now. Had a follow up with another echogram and my heart is now almost normal with no skipped beats but still a slight erratic beat. Heartr is beating stronger with heart rate in the upper 60's and low 70's. I feel much better with no side effects. I am 65 years old, retired and driving a school bus which the Dr. made me stop because of my heart stopping. Now I can go back to driving again thanks to the drug. ",5
"I've been taking Toprol XL for 10 years for heart arrythmia (SVT).  My dose is very low (12.5 mg daily), and I insist on the name brand only -- no generics for this one -- because I have heard that there is a lot of variance between generics for this drug.  (Insurance company refuses to pay for it, but worth it to me.)  I have been very happy with it overall, it works well to minimize the severity of the arrythmias.  I do experience mild chest pain from time to time, though, that I think are from the med.  But the good definitely outweighs the bad.",5
I take 50 mg can i increase the mg my bp is still high ,4
Works great at lowering blood pressure. taking for 2 years,5
it keeps my heart beat at a basic rate,4
Over all I am happy with this medication because it is a once a day pill. The only complaint that I have is my dreams. It causes me to have extremely vivid extremely odd dreams.,5
"Suffered severe altered mental state after taking this med for only 3 days.  No memory of two days prior to family member finding me in my home in altered mental state of severe confusion disorientation.  Did not recognize family members, unaware of my surroundings, etc., etc.  Rushed by ambulance to ER.  After recovering and then speaking with health care professionals I have learned that this ia rare, but very real, side effect of this drug.  Doctors should report this to their patients when prescribing this med.  I had no idea this was a possible side effect.  If I had known, my family and I would have been diligent and this horrifying episode could have been avoided.",1
pounding in ears,4
"I was prescribed this med because I have angina; I had a stent placed in 2.5 months ago.  My bp has always been normal, so I think my cardiologist prescribed it for chest pain.  Only thing is I haven't had chest pain since he put the stent in.  This med is taken at night, so sleepyness/dizzyness isn't a problem.  The problem is WEIGHT GAIN.  I do aerobic exercise (elliptical) 45mins to and hour every day and I eat fruit and veggies and fish as well daily, I am trying to lose weight and I am gaining weight.  It is very distressing.",3
"please use only name brand,the generic is not equal.only take with food or after a meal in the morning. taking this on a empty stomach makes it hurt and develop gerd.",5
Not found a regular reduction in BP. Felt as though slower heart rate caused poor circulation in extremeties.,3
does not seem to work for blood pressure,3
I have had some weight gain but after having a headache everyday for an entire year I am thankful the toprol xl is working I ran out over the holiday and aftefr 4 days the migraine returne harder than before ,5
toprol keeps my weak heart beating at a slower pace,5
I have a terrible time with smelly gas since starting Toprol.  Anybody else had the same problem?,4
"Was taking topol XL 25 mg, the bottom of my feet and ankles felt like they wanted to fall asleep.   It got so the muscles in my leggs were aching alot, especially when I tried to rest.  I didn't think this 25mg pill could do this as it's so small.   So I started breaking them in half and watchin my blood pressure and it's workin my feet and leggs are feeling better and I cound't be happier as I've with my feet and legs hurting for a long timee.  So I started readin on here and seen many others were havin the problem with this med.   So anyway I broke the pill in half and am only takin 12.5 mg and I'm gettin better.  My heart beat is a little higher 135/80 but I feel better and I'm happy with the bottom number.",3
Have taken this med since 2001 and feet and just above the ankles have been tingling and achy leg musles and this med is the only thing I'm taking that I think is causing this.,4
If I don't receive this medication daily my pulse skyrockets. Don't like taking it because I am taking it to control my pulse and not my blood pressure and If my blood pressure is below 100 than I can't take it.,3
"weight gain,shortness of breath, tiredness,chest pain",2
"i have tachycardia and have been on Toprol XL for about 10 years.  i used to have a heart rate ranging from 120 - 140 and now it is between 60 and 90 usually.  the only downfall is my blood pressure is extremely low, as i never had high blood pressure, so it is commonly way too low.  i have had trouble losing weight, but the chest pain is gone and the rapid heart rate is also gone, so to me, it is worth it.",5
"I have been on the generic for about a month now.  My blood pressure and pulse are still high.  I have major headaches that last all day, I have chest pains, back pains, I get light headed when standing up.  I also have IBS and GERD and this medication is making my heart burn unbearable.  I also am bloated and have gained 5 pounds since taking this.  ",1
"I have been on this for 13 months after heart surgery  for tumor. Although it has kept bp at good rates,  I am taking 100mg a day. My weight has steadily gone up (30 lbs.)in a year. I am starting a different med -ace inhibitor instead of beta blocker  to see if there is a change. ",3
I have always had HBP.  My doctor started me on Toprol 75MG.  That was 6 years ago and I am at the 200MG level now and am finally at the BP I want to be at 120/70.  Great drug and have not had any side effects to date.,5
"I was doing 50 mg x 2 / day, but it made me very sleepy.  It was keeping my heart rate way down.  When I rode my bicycle, I was always out of breath. Doc cut it back to 1xday and it's better.  Intense dreams?  Oh, yeah.  It's like an LSD trip and an alnight pass to to the freak show.  I had to learn that if I woke up and thought I should do something, I should think again.  And if I lay back down, the next show will soon start.  But, intense dreams are OK with me.  And the REM sleep is all good.  This ought to be a sleep dis-order med.",4
treatment has worked great except for pulmonary issues. i never had breathing problems until i started medication but its worth the side effect,5
"I USE TOPROL XL IT WORKS GREAT,I TRIED TO USE THE GENERIC FORM OF THIS MED. HAD A-LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS JOINT PAIN TIRED ENDED UP TWICE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH RAPID HEART BEATS.I WENT BACK TO NON GENERIC AND EVERYTHING IS GOOD. ",5
"Cold Blu Feet and Hands, dizziness, sleep all the time depressed",1
This medicine gives me heartburn and headaches.,5
"I have only been taking 25 mg for several weeks. I am in a constant state of mild confusion. I suffer muscle weakness amd lethargy. When I told my doctor that the side effects were taking a pronounced toll, he just said that I had to work through the side effects. If I had known how terrible the side effects were, I would have never started taking it. As it is, I have reduced my intake by 1/2 a pill each night, otherwise I would be unable to perform my duties at work. I feel as if my doctor was not honest in informing me of the potential side-effects nor has he made any suggestions of available alternates.",1
"I have pvc's and while not dangerous, they are scary and The Toprol only helps marginally.      Plus I am tired all the time.           the ",3
could this drug cause drowsiness? I have been taking this drug for years and think it is causing me fatigue thanks.,4
"I have been on toprol xl 25 mg for 7 years now.I tried the generic for a long time because it was cheaper with the insurance,but it made my chest hurt all the time,I felt horible on it.In addition it gave me bad hip ,back, and leg pain. I now pay out of my pocket for the name brand only and it makes a huge difference,it works better,no more tight chest or pain anywhere.There is a difference in the generic and name brand,don't let the doctors or anyone tell you there the same.",5
I had a mild heart attack at end of July. I was on 100mg of the generic metropolol. i could barely stay awake. now i take 50mg and i am still always tired and my chest feels tight. i hate it! i feel worse than b4 i had the heart attack. i also take lisinopril 40mg. i cannot lose weight. im definitely tellin my dr i need something else. ,1
"I have taken Toprol for 2 years, since a triple bypass surgery in 2008.  It manages my blood pressure extremely well and lowers my pulse which was typically around 100 and now stays around 70-80.  It has also kept my PVCs in check.  My doctor says no other medication can protect me like Toprol but it is causing me to lose my beautiful hair (I'm female and 62), which causes me great stress.  I have lost a good 70% already.  I also have experienced considerable cognitive decline and memory loss.  I haven't gained weight but have not been able to lose a single pound although I have totally changed my diet and am restricted to a heart healthy, very low fat and cholesterol way of eating.",5
"My doctor put me on it for my heart rate sometimes, it make me dizzy, and really tired , but other that it has helped me,",4
Ihave no problems with the medication.  I still have some papipations,4
"Long time user; 15 years.  Excellent effectiveness, however the following side effects are causing me to wean very slowly off of it:  Weight gain, sluggishness, extreme fatigue, metal cloudiness, morning cough.",5

"Toprol has worked very well for me, however I did experience lesser effects (higher blood pressure)while using the generic version. I now buy only Toprol and pay the additional cost.",4
"A serious accident left me with brain stem damage and tachycardia and fainting.  My cardioloist prescribed this drug after other measures to control my HR failed.  My fainting spells are gone, and my BP isn't lowered that much.  My heart would wear out 10-20 years early without beta-blockers.  I urge anyone who cannot control their BP with a DASH diet and nice exercise to go ahead and take a beta-blocker.  Taper on slowly, keep in mind that they will make you a bit tired at first, and if you get evil side effects, get a different beta-blocker from your Dr.  Every person is different -- they react differently to various drugs!  I like this drug, and it works well for me....",4
I need to know how much sodium is in Toprol xl 50,5
will this drug cause headaches,4
while taking the ganeric brand METOPROLOL EXTENDED - RELEASE - ORAL It gave me Gout. When I changed back to Toprol it went away. The same thing happend to another friend of mine.,5
"weight gain since taking this medication 5 months is 15lbs. In the pm I get very sleepy, driving is a chore I want to fall asleep while driving. ",2
Very bad for me.  Dropped my heart rate to 39 beats per minute.  6 days after taking this drug I ended up in the ER w/chest pain & headache.  Next day in ER again for migrane.  3 days later still having pressure in my head & neck eventho the ER doctor took me off of Toprol and back on Benicar.  Yesterday my heart rate was up & down.  Sometimes it seemed like I was running a mariton.  Today not a bad but still having pressure in my head & neck.  I sure hope I will be feeling back to normal again.  I have already missed 5 days of work.  ,1
"There are many meds I can take without the side effects causing me to stop taking it. I have been on Toprol XL for over 3 years now, I started out on 25mg and now take 50mg per day. I have zero side effects and the have controlled my BP well. I have no issue with either the name brand or generic.",4
"Was prescribed Metoprolol Hydrochlorothiazide Oral  for migraine headache control and high blood pressure (stress related).  Used for a VERY long time, but discovered that my dosage was causing hair loss.  Cut dosage in half and hair loss has slowed to something close to normal.  Doctor changed me to a 24 hour slow release version Toprol XL and I'm pleased with the results so far.  (I had hoped that I could go off of any bp med after stress situation was addressed, but found that migraines returned if I missed more than three days. ",5
"Good, very goog!",5
"Seems as if I have to urnate a lot after taking this or could it be other drugs, such a Pendil that causes this? ",4
"Works reliably,without side effects, for me.",4
"Terrible night sweats, pounding heart, weight gain and I have only been on this 3 weeks.  Worst of it is, I now have hemorrhoids which bleed and will not go away.   Nasty stuff to take, am going back shortly and tell the doctor to get me off this garbage.",1
"My personal opinion only, everyone has a choice. So to those of you who are having bothering side effects, I suggest you gradually take yourselves off this medication. To those who haven't started taking yet, DON'T. Too many side effects. I have decided to take my own advice and start treating my BP with diet and exercise. My DR. is too quick to prescribe meds when lifestyle change will probably be the ticket. You've heard the saying ""Drugs Kill"", I'm not willing to take the chance. Good Luck to each and everyone of you and happy exercising and healthy diet.",1
Every thing was going along until I failed to reorder in a timely fashion. Then I felt very weak and faint with a queasy stomach. ,5
"I forgot to mention the fact that it was almost impossible to sleep while i was on this poison, and when i did sleep, i had nightmares that would scare an otherwise brave person. This is a very dangerous drug...",1
"I was prescribed this drug for both high blood pressure and migraines...and it made my life a living hell for 6 months by causing very severe depression that very nearly sent me over the edge. I thought death was a certainty for me. I complained bitterly to the doctor about it, but he kept telling me to keep taking it...my depression keep getting worse. I went back to my regular doctor, i he took me off of it and put me back on calcium channel blockers, and had to prescribe Paxil CR to me before my depression would start to improve. Toprol XL and all other Beta Blockers are poison as far as i am concerned...and this crap didn't even lower my blood pressure one bit. They did help the migraine problem, but i had rather have migraines than go through what i did with severe depression. I never had a problem with depression until i took Toprol XL. ",1
Has anyone out there been affected with hair loss from this drug,3
I just found out I have h/p yesterday. I was placed on this medication and I have a few fears about taking it.,2
"started this last month, had slightly elevated blood pressure and have been diagnosed with tacky cardia, with in a month my heartrate dropped to 70 and my last blood pressure was yesterday 89/50 now i thought that was extremely low but my doctor said it was ok.  so going by that it seems to be working.",4
Heart flutter has been lessened,4
"I have gained 8 lbs since starting Toprol last summer(less than 1 year).  I work out at the gym 5 days a week and eat healthier and can't lose a pound. I had cluster headaches for a week at the time.  I haven't had those since 1 mo after starting.  What to do?  I believe I now have gout, and am having lots of joint pain.",5
"I was put on toprol about 4 years ago after experiencing pressure in my chest and trouble breathing while exercising. I have a genetic hemolytic anemia and my cardiologist felt that because I was seriously anemic, my heart was working too hard to provide blood to my muscles as I was working out. This also happended when walking up hills and stairs.  I still have shortness of breath but the pressure is not as bad.  I also get dizzy, but that could also be the lack of blood in my body.  The only side effect I noticed @ 50mg is very weird night dreams.  Hard to describe, but I would be laying in bed and open my eyes and can see ""things"" like bugs, sometimes faces. This happened within about a week of taking this drug and still occurs.  I'm used to it and sometimes it'll spook me and sometimes it's funny, usually I just go back to sleep.  Very weird.  All and all...no severe side effects.",3
I have been using Toprol XL and it's generic version for the last 7 years. I was prescribed this drug for pre-hypertension and have encountered much success with a daily 100mg dose. ,5
the generic of this pill is a loser I plan to start taking the original and will measure my results then.,1
why can you not eat grapefruit while on this medication,5
"I started this drug about 5 years ago for high b/p & irregular heart rythym. I found that generic TOPRAL XL does NOT work same as name brand. Generic releases ingredients much faster, hence STOPS working in your body faster without most aware.Look @ Pharmacy.com for this info. If your MD will write ""medically neccessary"" for named brand only, most Insurance will / must pay & you wil pay LOWER co - pay as it's medically neccessary.

"I have experienced excessive weight gain--45 lbs--since starting Toprol XL.  I am in constant pain from joints--hip and knee.  I didn't connect it with the medication until I read some of the other reviews.  I have been to several doctors plus chiropractor, physical therapist, etc. with no relief.  I will stop the medication and see if that helps--provided the condition is reversible.  Also, it hasn't done much to improve my blood pressure and my pulse, which is already low (50's)sometimes hits 45. My doctor doesn't seem concerned.",1
"I have been on all the generic toprol xl and they are not the same as the name brand.The last generic by watson made my chest hurt about a half hour after taking it each day.So I lhad my doc write a perscrition for the name brand and it works great. No more anxiety and chest pain.The pharmacy and docs tell you there all the same but there not. I will keep paying the higher copay and get the real thing as long I as feel good, its worth not feeling like crap everday.",5
i have not had no problems with this medication i am taking it because i have an irreagular heart beat and it has treated it good,5

"I have been using this medication for about 5 years.  I have complained to my doctor since the onstart of this drug about insomnia, hair loss, being out of breath when walking short distances, weight gain, and joint pain. My arm or hand will go numb if I sleep on my side.  I want to get off of this medication, because I am taking hydrochlorothiazide along with it, and I think I can control my blood pressure with that, exercise and diet.

"I have been on toprol xl 50mg for about a year now. I take it for palpitations due to a tear in my heart valve. After the first couple months I noticed extreme fatigue and numbness in my arms. However it reduces the stress on my heart tremendously, lowering my emotional stress as well, I find myself not angering as easily as before and my chest pain is minimal. Over the past year I have more side effects like being ""over-emotional"" and nightmares. I have a nightmare 1-2x a week. Now I am a brave woman, and these nightmares are getting worse and worse each time. The dreams are so disturbing that I cannot go back to sleep after wards for hours and sometimes not at all out of fear. Not nightmares about scary monsters or murderers, no. Dreams about horrific things happening to loved ones. Now, the medicine does prevent me from having a heart attack which is great, but just be aware of the possibility that the side effects will test your strength mentally and physically.",4
I have used this med for almost 2 yrs.  I have never had any side effects and bp has been well managed.  My doc recently increased to 50mg a day and I have begun to experience tingling in my fingers at night that wakes me from sleep.,5

I stopped because I am tired of taking RXs. I feel they good do not out weigh the side affects,3
the drug is good but it kicks my butt really bad sometimes. to the point of feeling faint and comatose. at that time i have to lay down and just tuff out the symptoms. if not for that it would be great. this doesnt happen everytime but when it does it is miserable.,4
does not seem to bring the BP down all the time - constantly,3

Excessive thinning of my hair and severe tinnitus,4

I now have severe joint and muscle pain in additon to very severly swollen feet, legs, hands and abdomen.  During this time I also developed a colon tumor. Where did that come from? Not hereditary in my family. A very bad medication, should be taken off the market.  I am slowly coming off it, under my doctors direction (at my request). I have used both the name brand and the generic. Generic is much worse.",2
I need to take this medication for frequent tachycardia.  I am now up to 175 mg daily. I can't take more than 50 mg at one time because I get 'zoned' out; so my doctor told me to cut in half and take 4 times a day.  This seems to work so well and I don't feel funny.  Works for me!,5
got on mainly for missing heartbeats. works well for blood pressure but not as well for missing beats...doctor wants to try me on VERAPAMIL ER 240 MG. I will see...maybe will do better inslead of TOPROL. ALSO so far lack of sex drive and lots of aches on TOPROL.,4

The drug has been very effective in preventing SVT episodes. I also have hypertension, and take two additional drugs for that. I took 100 mg Toprol XL once a day but a few years ago noticed I was having some asthma-like symptoms. My doctor decreased the Toprox XL to 50 mg/day, added another blood pressure med, and I no longer have respiratory problems. That's the only side effect I ever had with Toprol XL, but only at the higher dosage. It's a good thing, too, as the docs tell me that I will likely need the Toprol to control the SVT for the rest of my life. ",5
"I take the generic for occasional situational anxiety and it works like magic.  I go from shaking nerves and uncontrollable heartbeat to a calm state in just a few minutes.  This is off label and my Dr. was even skeptical of the near instantaneous nature of the effect. He recommended I take it daily.  But that is definitely not necessary for this off label indication.  Anybody who experiences ""high anxiety"" in a few specific situations once in a while should definitely take this.  Furthermore, after using it a couple of times for a particular situation, I have noticed that a the situation that previously caused uncontrollable nerves often becomes less traumatic to the point of no longer needing the medicine or not even thinking of it.",5

Had all the tests, my heart was not the problem. Doctors at the hospital were not listening to the feeling of lack of oxygen symptoms, as my tests are showing 100% oxygen in my blood stream. I get to go to the clinic this coming wen. New doctor, mabey she will listen. I have also started with great foot pain in my heels and numbness in my right arm. There is always the possibility that this is not due to toprol, however these prob didn't start until my toprol started. Also my vision has required new prescriptions twice this last year. Be careful and don't just attribute your symptoms to overweight or age as this is not normal.         ",2

Blood pressure under control experiencing feet pain!,4
"Six years ago, had a heart attack at 48yo. Was put on Toprol XL 50mg, went through the usual light headedness, dizzyness, etc. had broaderline high bloodpressure 150/160 over 85/98 pressure - heart rate always in the 80's at rest. Dr increased to 100mg still the same, then increased to 200mg each day. Never really brought BP down that much from normal(Dr wanted BP at 117-120/75-78)... For about 5 1/2 years, I've complained of shortness of breath just from walking short distances, trouble sleeping, blurry vision(worse in the morning), swelling of feet/hands, gas/bloating, fatigue, numbness in hands at waking in mornings, moodyness, weight gain(50lbs), hair loss, Sex drive/ED and now, the shortness of breath is so bad, they claim that I've come down with adult onset asthma but can't control that cause I'm still on 200mg of Toprol XL that might be contributing to the breathing problems (or maybe not even have asthma?).... How to get off of it now?  Primary Care doctor wants me off, don't think the cardiologist wants to bother, just like the pulmonary Dr....They would rather get me on an inhaler and be done with it!!!",2
"causes problems breathing ,weakness and trouble sleeping",3
I have never had a problem with this med. I get the generic and cut it in half.  That makes for a cheap remeody for blood pressure. ,5
I have been taking Toprol XL or the generic for about 5 years now. Started taking it for exercise induced arrhythmia.  I walk every day and exercise 4 or more times per week.  I eat very healthy foods and am active yet still tired many times during the day.  Heart rate is great at 60-64 and BP is 100/60 not a bad side effect for those results….,4

My weight has leveled off, but I gained approximately 75 pounds. Every 3 months I went to the my Doctor, my weight went up 15 pounds. This lasted for a little more than a year.

"I have been taking brand name Toprol XL 100 mg for 3 years.. after reading similiar side effect issues with other users, I too notice the hair loss, tingling in my hands and hard time keeping weight down.  I will say that the generic had me experiencing more side effects and I will never go back to generic.  I was being treated for high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms mainly due to stress.  After reading that my hair loss and weight gain is probably due to the medication... I will try harder than ever to make lifestyle changes to slowly get off of it.  Overall..I have been satisfied taking Toprol XL and it has helped with BP and heart rhythms.   ",4
"I was first prescribed 25mg at 23 yrs old. I took Toprol for 11 years, up to 150mg 2x daily because my a-fib continued. I had two catheter ablations to relieve the a-fib. I had an easy time taking the drug. I took flecanide (300mg) with it closer towards my procedure. All in all it ended up to do the trick... It has now been 4.5 years since the catheter ablation and a-fib is back. I am now on 25mg at 40 years of age. I am not hesitant to take this drug at all.",4

"I have been on the generic for Toprol XL for almost 2 weeks. It has helped with my fast heartbeat but not completely.

"I am a 30yr old female who was placed on this drug about 3 1/2yrs ago due to my high blood pressure.My Dr's could not get it under control enough until I was placed on 200mg. I tried several other drugs and this one seems to be the best for me. I found out I had HBP when I was pregnant with my first child 3 1/2yrs ago(my pregnancy was rough-had preclampsia and toximia). My OB said that I could not go to full term or there was a chance I could loose my life and the baby's, so my daughter was born 7wks early via c-section. I was also told that it was not wise for me to have another child due to this problem. I never knew I had HBP until we figured out that I was born with only one kidney(via ultrasound and testing through Dartmouth Hospital) and that kidney was working too hard by itself. All these years I have always had HBP and they told me and my mom while I was growing up is that I had the ""white coat syndrome""-afraid of Dr's, but if I had not been pregnant I would have never knew I was going to have this issue for the rest of my life. I am veey pleased that this medicine is working for me............I need to be around for a long time to see my daughter grow up!",5
grateful for relief from numerous migrains,4
"since my doctor put me on this medication it has helped. It relieved the tightness in my chest and I can breathe better, have been on it now for 8 months and no side effects I know of. Very pleased with it.",5
"I didn't notice any difference between Toprol and the generic, but I had a very difficult time with the replacement medication while Toprol was off the market (generic Lopressor).  I had a significant increase in palpitations and shortness of breath.  So much so, that I ended up having a stress test and cardiac cath.  The response to my complaints was to continue to increase the dosage until I was so lightheaded and fatigued, I was miserable. ",4
"I have experienced weight gain, swelling and dark reddening of my feet and ankles, also dark red blotches on my arms.  I never had these problems before taking the generic from of Toprol xl 100mg a day.  Also constantly tired.  Night sweats and crazy dreams.  Told this to the Doc, but he poo poos me.

The dr. then told me it was the Toprol. It messed with my heart rhythum and now I have an irregular heartbeat thanks to taking Toprol XL. They need to take this med. off the maket before it kills someone! ",1
"This medication will leave you with little energy.  Also, it makes you short of breath while working out.  I would recommend something else to treat high blood pressure.",3

"I have been on the generic of this drug metropolol xl for several years now due to HBP. It has worked well for me but I have noticed a weight gain. No other serious side effects. The past few months as I refilled my prescription I noticed the pills were different each time. Also my BP would seem to be better on one form of the pill than it was the next month on a different form of the pill. At my physical the Dr. said there was a problem with the manufacturer and switched me to atenolol. Only been 4 days since the switch so am not sure of atenolol yet. Toprol worked well for me, wish there was no problem with the manufacturer.",4

it helps with angina pain. sometimes more servere then others.,5
"This drug was given to me, while I was in the hospital with extreme pain across the top/back of my shoulders and very high blood pressure...207/90 (due to that pain). Also given to me were HCTZ and Lipitor. Within a day I was very ill (nausea and vomiting) and blood work showed liver enzymes out of whack! My primary care doctor took me off the drugs and sent me to a heart specialist. Under the care of the heart specialist (for 18 months) no heart problem was found. My liver enzymes continued to be abnormal. Seven years later, my blood pressure was 128/75 at my last physical. I have two other high blood pressure incidents since the first...one due to a compression fracture of the spine, after a fall; and recently during a bout of bronchitis with extreme coughing. Both times, blood work and extensive testing were done. Both times heart problems were definitely ruled out. So, patient beware of drugs such as Toprol, unless your doctor is sure your heart condition warrants its' use!",1
"I have been on Toprol XL for 5+ yrs.  Recently went to the doc for extreme fatigue, weight gain & she took me off of it.  Switched to Corgal (sp) & have only been on it 2 days & can tell a huge difference in my fatigue.  I have more energy & its only day 2.  My blood pressure was way low when I went in as well.  It worked great for me the last 5+ years.  Only 5-10 pounds gained.",5
Actually it was the opposite. The generic for toprol was recalled due to size differences in the pills. Torprol XL is still being dispensed. Got some just yesterday. I'm having my dose cut in half as it is becoming harder to get an aerobic exercise in due to a slower heartrate. The toprol fights against aerobic exercise.,4
no problems,5
went to doc's yesterday and he said toprolxl was going to be taken off market putting me on metroproal anyone else heard anything,3
"After reading all the side effects people are having with this drug,,please try something else, i feel this is a very dangerous drug for some people. I had very bad side effects still dealing with side effects. I hope they take it off the market as soon as possible. ha",2

"seems to work, but my skin is breaking out on my face and back, big sores is this from the medication",3
The only thing that i am concerned about is that the pharmacutical companys are not making this drug fast enough and i myself has had to take a generic form and i prefer the topral xr then having to take it twice daily. This really needs to be addressed.,4
I am on Toprol XL 200 mg and Diovan 80mg and my blod pressure is 98/72 with a HR of 89.  I think I am on too much meds.  Feel light headed and weak,2

"My cardiologist prescribed Toprol XL 50mg(AstraZeneca) at the beginning of March. I was to start with 25mg a day in the am for the first week then increase to 50mg. I stopped the drug at the end of the first week because I was experiencing almost narcoleptic-type episodes - falling asleep without awareness, extremely tired, irritable, wild dreams at night disrupting my sleep. I waited two weeks and tried the 25mg again, taking it in the morning. Again, I nodded off while interviewing a job candidate! I thought maybe it was a seizure! Stopped the drug immediately and symptoms have gone. ",1
"just started on 100 mg a day.  feel wiped out; just want to go to sleep.  but, blood pressure is down.  yea!  ",4
"Ok folks, its time to start reporting to the Medical Board about these Doctors refusing to believe us when we tell them of the sever side effects. Why are doctors such jerks and look at you like you are crazy?? I just came off Diovan same thing Numbness in hands feet, thought i was going to loose my mind. Of course my Dr yelled at me and told me it was not the Diovan. I just started on toprol 50mg 2 days ago.

"Itake 25mg of the generic toprolxl by par and it works great.I used to take it before bed but I would be very tired the next morning,so now I take it after breakfest and it does not make me tired during the day.",5

"I am a 56 yo female. I began taking Toprol XL 50 mg over a year ago with 2 other BP medications. My blood pressure came down from 160/100 to approx. 130-140/80-90. The doctor increased the Toprol to 100 mg.  Recently I started having symptoms that I attributed to cold symptoms. I have been very sleepy- not tired- sleepy. I would pass out on my sofa after work, and then fall asleep on the sofa again at 8 PM until it was time to get up and go to bed. I would even close my eyes while I took my daily walk because I was so sleepy. I also had dyspnea at the slightest exertion. I also had severe sacral pain and muscle pain in my thighs. I don't take any statin medication, so I couldn't understand why I was having so much musculoskeletal pain. I decreased my dosage to 50 mg daiily and experienced immediate relief. My dyspnea is better, I feel more alert, and my sacral pain is gone. Toprol is a medication that must be reduced gradually, so be sure to see your doctor if you're having any side effects.",5
"I have been on this drug for 5 years. Started at 50, now on 100.  I am a diabetic, and it slightly increased my blood sugar, so I am now on metformin 1000.  I do not get nervous speaking in public, or meeting new people as before, as it blocks adreniline from your heart.  Still able to orgasm, ( female), no hair loss, weight gain, like others describe.  When I workout, I cannot get my pulse above 120. But the treadmill run everyday does help me control weight, as I am also recently menopausal.  I am having trouble losing weight 5 11, 194 lbs. I should weight 164.  Feel very good though. Better than without it. Have not tried generic..I would rather pay extra 30 dollars than loose control of BP. ",5
I was taken OFF this med recently because of an FDA issue with manufacturing (that's what I'm told) but the replacement meds are NOT workingt (mistake in earlier post).  TOPRAL XL helped control skipped heartbeats also.  Is there an issue with TOPRAL XL?,5
"I have been taking the Toprol XL, 25mg generic by PAR Pharm. for over a year now, in conjunction with Lisinopril-HCTZ.  I only take half a tab of the Toprol once day (at bedtime), but I am so exhausted in the a.m. I can barely get up & go to work. This a.m. my pulse was 51. I am either going to try taking it during the day or ask my Doc to switch to another med. It is really effective at keeping my BP low, but at the cost of being extremely fatigued. It is especially bad in the a.m., does not matter how many hrs of sleep I get.",2
"I was taking toprol xl 100mg, my Dr. replaced it with 2 50mg, one in the morning and one at bedtime. Its working fine for me.",5
developed thrush,5
Helped my high blood pressure,3
I personally had great results from this drug with very little side effects at all. I do have a slight decrease in sexual desire but for a single person it is not a major factor. I give the drug a high rating.,5
"I am having problems similar to that of previous reviewer. I was told by pharmacist that Toprol XL was no longer available. I had been tking it for years. My doctor precribed the generic and it is not the same. Heart beat is irregular and racing; am dizzy, and short of breath. I have a call in to doctor to ask for something different. This substitute is not working.",3
"The pharmacy told me that the generai was recalled. I was reading on the web about the side effects of the generic, fatigue, anxiety , irregular heartbeats and other things. I've been on it since June and I was wondering why I felt so bad all the time and I was only taking 50mg per day. I was on the brand name and there is a difference. I argued with the doctor and got him to ok the brand name. I was son the brand name before and thigs were ok.  I read that the manufactuer of the generic  was reported for poor quality control and documentation of processes. What the heck was the FDA doing for all this time. The complaints aren't new they have been receiving them for a while is what I'm told. So the generic is off the market and it was recalled. The pharmacys all lie and say it is back ordered, but I don't think it is comming back at all.",4
It works well for me by keeping my heart rate less than 100 BPM. It just hampers me in any exertion I do by me getting short winded.,5
I THINK IT HAS MADE MY DEPPRESION AND ANXITY.,5
very fatigued,3
"how can i tell which generic of toprol xl i am taking ? are there codes on the tablet. i also heard that the phar parmacutical was just as good as the toprol xl, no different. no one told me until i read it at Medco on my own that there was a recall, and i called. they said they were giving me the brand name toprol xl even though the bottle had metroprol sullicate after the recall.",3
"I have been told that this drug is no longer being made. I can't find a pharmacy who has a supply anywhere. I am unable to get my prescription filled. My doctors appt isn't until march 3rd,I am frantic.",4
I have heard nothing of a recall - - I just had mine refilled today.,3
was on metoprolol genneric for toprol xl could not stand the side efects weight gain forgetful now that I can't get it they are letting me get toprol xl health insur. is covering it tell me if you can is the name brand better then the genneric with the side effects??,2
I was wondering the person that said the binders in the generic toprol xl caused side effects and weight gain what generic was it?I take the generic by par pharm. and I thought it was the same manufacture as the name brand by astrizenica.Let me know!,4
told by pharmacy that drug is no longer available,5
"The generic blood pressure causes sleepless nights, anxious thoughts, forgetfulness, no energy, totally exhausted.  My daughter has to help me even walking to the bathroom most times because I feel so exhausted all the time.  When I asked my doctor to give me the brand name he declined.  I called my pharmacy and they told me Metoprolol is being taken off the market in April, but they had not heard of it being recalled.",2
MY PHARMACY INFORMED ME THAT THIS DRUG HAD A RECALL ON IT AND I HAD TO BE PUT ON LOPRESSOR INSTEAD. DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THIS RECALL?,5
It seem to work for a while theb ny bloodpressure took of again. The doctor increased the doseage but it did not effect my rising bloodpressure. So the doctor switched to another drug that did control it ,4
"I have been on the real stuff, not generic and my pressure went from 150/101 to 122/82/ I had some side pain and now some back discomfort but I think it is unrelated. Feels more like a sore back because of the cold weather. It will make you tired so take it at night before bed. I seem to pee more too but not much than before with all the coffee I drink! I think this works for me so I'll stay on it until it doesn't work any more.Don't listen to all the bad stories.I was on another pill and had a mild case of ED. Never got a hard erection. This brought it back but I still have lost a bit of the desire. Before all these pills I had no problem staying hard or being ready.",5
The TOPROL/METOPROLOL recall is mainly for the generic drug which is manufactured by ETHEX pharm. and SANDOZ pharm. The generic manufactured by PAR pharmaceutical is OK. The brand drug TOPROL-XL is manufactured by Astra Zeneca pharm. and I understand that PAR pharm. is also alligned with Astra Zeneca. either one appears a good choice. These generic (junk pills) were investigated and reported by both CONSUMER LABS (White Plains NY) and THE PEOPLES PHARMACY in April of last year. What was the FDA doing??? ,4
"I was started on another blood pressure medication which was causing problems, so my doctor switched me to toprol XL. I have very good results with this medication. It took a week or so for my body to adjust to it, which the Doctor explained to me from the beginning. My druggest switched me to the generic brand which was not a good thing, the generic drug does not work for me. My doctor has to write dispense as written on every prescription or the drug store will give you the generic form. I have been on this medication for almost 3 years now and it has made a big difference in my life.              ",5
Quit taking this med after I fell asleep while driving. I took that particular dose 13 hrs. previous.  Constant fatigue and drowsiness. Almost like I had narcolepsy. Felt better after out of my system. I must mention this was the generic version. Has this happened to anyone else? And did the name brand help you with these side affects?,3
"I have been using this for over 7 years and the prescription version has been effective until now. I tried the generic but it didn't work. Only since my last refill has the prescription version been working like the generic. My blood pressure is up, my heart beat is irregular; it's like I'm not taking anything at all. I came here to learn what might be wrong and find someone says it's being ""quietly recalled"". Why quietly? Why hasn't my Doctor or Pharmacist notified me? I'm going to call my Doctor as soon as he opens but where can I go to find out more information? I did use the pill identifier to verify the markings match the prescription but something is obviously wrong and I have been endangered by it. If you're taking this, ask your Doctor if he/she's heard of a recall. Thankfully there is a site like this where I can get information at 5 AM. ",1
This drug is being quietly recalled.,1
I have tachycardia. My heart doctor prescribed this to me about 5 1/2 years ago. I had positive results with toprol. I can no longer get it from my pharmacist.??It was very convenient to take.( at bedtime)I'm hoping I will be able to use it again. ,5
hypertention,4
"i started out on the generic.. it was awful.weight gain,dry mouth,headaches.finally my dr put me on the name brand. it works very well.lost the weight and the ""flutters"" are gone.have dropped dose in half and doing good.found out the binders in the generic was the cause of side effects.",5
"i first started this med because of anxiety and palpatations, used it for 2 plus years the past four mnths have been experiencing extreme hair loss lost about 50 percent! my endocrinologist suggested that is was the toprol, i am hopeful that now that i will discontinue this loss will stop there are other drugs out there for anxiety, losing my hair has caused nothing but anxiety!",3
"The brand works best for me.  I used the generic for several months only to find that my sx increased, palpatations.  I was going to increase my dose; thinking drug was ineffective at 50mg but saw an article in the prevention magazine about generic drugs.  Toprol xl was one of the drugs discussed in the article.  The author stated that if the generic was not produced by a certain (can't remember the name)pharmacutical co. you may experience increased sx.  I finished the generic then refilled the med with the brand toprol xl.  After a couple doses I noticed that my sx were under control again.  I was so excited when toprol went generic I thought I could save money but I'd rather pay more for the brand than feel awful.  I am a believer in generics but in this case it didn't work for me.

"I HAVE HAD VERY HIGH- HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, IT IS ONE OFTHE MAIN MEDS I TAKE FOR IT. IT HAS WORKED GOOD FOE ME.  I HAVE TO HAVE THE LONG LASTING, CANNOT TAKE THE OTHER IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.",5
"I was diagnosed with high BP a year ago which was a complete surprise since I've always been very thin, healthy and reasonably active& only 38.  I started taking generic metoprolol by Sandoz- and at first felt really good- it lowered my BP, plus completely eliminated headaches, chestpain& tightness.  However, after 2 months I became extremely exhausted, I began having episodes of numbness& tingling in arms and legs at night and suddenly gained 10 pounds all around the middle. By month 10, I was waking up several times a night with my arms and legs heavy and numb.  Finally I requested the Brand Name TOPROL XL. I've been taking it for 2 months and feel MUCH better.  My energy is back, the numbness&tingling has decreased significantly, and hopefully now I will also start to get rid of that weight around the middle!  It is my personal theory that perhaps the generic metoprolol released the dose too quickly, dropping my BP so much at night that my arms&legs ""fell asleep"" due to lack of circulation- sometimes my AM BP was 85/55. Then I'm thinking maybe my body released a bunch of cortisol to raise my BP again- which contributed to my weight gain around the middle.  My doctor disagrees and suggested I see a neurologist.  Is there any other MD out there who thinks I could be on the right track?  I would suggest to anyone prescribed this med to first try the BRAND NAME TOPROL XL for at least 3 months to see how you react to it and what to expect before using a generic.",5
"I've been taking toprolxl 25 mg for a year now.Been on name brand and then the generics by sandoz and ethenex.Those two generics do not work and they made my chest hurt.I found an article in the doctors office about generic toprol xl and it said the only generic that is exactly the same as the name brand is par pharmisutical by astrazenica.So I asked the doctor about this and he said it is the only generic one you should take,Of course he never mentioned this before until I asked.So now be sure to ask at the pharmacy who makes the generic they carry.Ifeel much better now.",4
I have been on the generic for toporolxl.  Sometimes my heart races and my bp is inconsistent with it.  Using it for just 4 weeks.  Experiencing weakness in legs and arms.  Wondering if it is the med or maybe my body still adjusting to it.,2
"I have been on this medication for 7 years. I started at 25 mg,then upped the dose to 50 and am now on 100 mg. Taking it now at bedtime, to help with the fatigue. I have had weight gain, numbness in right hand, and slight depression. The generic Does Not work. Are these side effects from Toprol or due to menopause??",4
I take in conjunction with Diovan HCT and have had no problems so far.,4
I HAVE BEEN TAKING THE TOPROL XL FOR 20 YRS AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THE TOPROL. WORKS EXCELLENT.,5
Been taking med for 3 years.  It has completely stopped palpitations.  Heartbeat lowered to 60's but BP remains a bit high 130's/90's.  Biggest side effect was weight gain but Dr insist it has nothing to do with med.  Mild loss in sex drive and hair loss but not sure if associated with med or aging.,3
TOO STRONG OF  A DOSE  100MG  CAUSE DIZZINESS ALL DAY,5
"while taking this med, I have encounter tremendous amount of fatigue and heaviness.  I am so very sleepy all day long and it seem like I am just sleeping my precious hours away. But I do understand that it takes time to get used to a new medication.  My Cardiologist wants to increase this medication to twice daily....that will take a tremendous toll on my waking hours, but in the next few months I believe that the cost of the fatigue will overall be more of a benefit to my condition than not, and as us patients understand the process of new medication it will just take time for us to get used to the new med....and than our bodies will adjust to the side effects and we will have a better enhancement of life.",3
"It has worked great at 25mg for my PVCs.  However, blood pressure is still high, triglycerides are high, feet & toes tingle, legs & hips hurt waking me up at night, and weight gain around the waist!!  Gee what fun side effects!!  Dr. is taking me off this med tomorrow and increase my Aceon instead.  Am happy about getting rid of the Toprol especially since readers that other users have been having the same side effects.  When you mention these to your physician or nurse they are absolutely clueless!!!  This is very disturbing.  ",5
I started taking this about a monthe ago not real sure about its effectiveness yet but my blood pressure was so high before that it caused an anyerysm and stroke i am 44 years old so i will try anything to keep my b/p down.  I am lucky to be alive.,4
Ever since I've been taking this I have had dizzy spells and ringing in my ears. I want to find something else to control my high blood pressure,2
"I have been on this medication for sometime and it does not seem to lower by BP below 170/64 to 90 and it spikes to over 220.  I have been to the emergy room twice in a few weeks, but it goes right back to elevated levels.  Please help me.",1
I have been on this drug for almost three years. I hate having to take it every day and my blood pressure is not going down it seems more constant and stable but its not helping it any. I also had racing heart so that is another reason I have been put on it and that has not happened since I have been on it but I am tired of taking it. I can't loose any weight since I have started taking it. I have actually gained weight and now I have to take Prilosec or the purple pill daily to maintain my tummy. It just sucks!!!,3
I have been on this drug for over a year.,3
"I've been on 25mg for several years.  It has not helped with the Afib.  The doc recently put me on propafenol to help with the AFIB.  He left me on Toprol XL (generic) to help keep blood pressure down.    My sex drive is dead, but I have not gained weight, had abnormal hair loss, joint pain, etc.  I do have memory problems, though.  I'm thinking I may ask the cardio to put me on something else for BP.",1
"not one day goes by that i dont have side effects dizzy,back pain, terrible been on it for about 6 o 7 months trying to stand it now going to another doctor to change.",2
I had trouble with headaches and coughing. I'm still looking trying to find that right BP medicine that wont ruin my days ahead. This one was not it.,2
"The first 4 months left me tired and listless, then woke up one day and felt great. Have been great ever since, until the metoporol generic came out.  Now the insurance companies claim the cheap one is ""preferred"" and covered.  Unfortunately, have tried it twice and it is definitely NOT the same. Blood pressure was unstable, got headaches, and the drug wore off half way through the day.  Paying the extra thinking generic metoporol is a lie. You get what you pay for, except with health insurance of course.",5
It makes me very tired and weak,3
NAUSEA,1
You can not mix this with Betapace as you receive a double dose.  ,4
"I have had high blood pressure for a number of years and have been on multiple diffeent types of medications.  I recently went tot he doctor and he upped my toprol from 50mg to 100mg and that is when the issues with my feet and ankles started. Not to mention my checst just really hurt. I have been taking this medicaion for a few years and to be honest it has never really worked that great. I have gained a bunch of weight and I am constantly tired. My feet have been a constant problem form the tingly, numbness to severe pain in my ankle joints. It dawned on m that it could be medication related and upon others reiews I think I may be on the right track. I am going to the doctor for the fourth time in ten days to once again discuss this concern. Either wya I need something different!",2

Heart rate drops @ times BP not well controlled,3
"I am 29 yrs old & started having severe pounding in my chest, migraines, shortness of breath, and extreme exhaustion about a month ago. My doctor put me on 25mg of Toprol XL (generic version: Metrolol). A month later my BP is barely down still around 162/114.  Dr now has my dosage at 100 mg a day.  I still have occassional headaches, pounding chest, and fatigue. But now something weird is happening with my hearing, and my eyes are 'crazy.' I also cannot stay awake.  Overall though, it's better than feeling like I'm having a heart attack.",3
"I am 51 and have been on Toprol XL for 5+ years.  If I miss a dose I will suffer with headache & extreme fatigue.  I have had to take Prilosec every day since I started because of indigestion & heartburn.  I have noticed lately my hands go numb at night and have a shortness of breath more often.  My hair is beginning to thin and I have noticed my memory has gotten worse.  I thought these were due to age, but I'm not that old!",4
i'v been on the drug for 2 mths now. i take it for irregular heart beat. I am really happy with it. i'm sleeping better.,4

"I've been on toprol for about 4 years and thought it effective for my high bp but it also made me gain quite a bit of weight. This week I spoke to my cardiologist and told him I wanted off the pills because of the weight gain and he told me it's not the toprol that makes me gain weight but that I was out of shape and shoould exercise more. I told him I would if I weren't so tired all the time. He then told me that one of the side affects of toprol is fatigue and since my stress test came back really good he would take me off the drug but I have to ween off it,one week half a pill one week quarter of pill one half a quarter. So far so good. I'm feeling much better, more energy and thanks to the help of weight watchers I've lost 2.6 lbs this week. If my pressure goes back up the dr. said he'll increase my water pill.",4
A few years ago took drug for high blood pressure.  After had taken for awhile began to have shortness of breath and pounding of heart with physical exertion. Also experienced severe head aches especially in back of head. Was fatigued with no energy.  Heart rate was low.  Finally had to go to ER and heart rate was in 40's and BP ok. ER doctor thought was Toprol and called family physicial.  Had heart test to elimination heart problems.  Was taken off Toprol and symptons began to disappear very soon.  Now taking Avalide and Verapamil which working well.,1
"I had been taking Toprol XL (name brand) for years with no problem.  After Thyroid Cancer Surgery and radioactive iodine treatments something changed.  I was constantly tired, lost a lot of hair, my eyes have been a mess blurred vision and constant tearing, tingling in my legs and hands.  The sympton became worse when the doctor raised the dosage from 25 mg to 50 mg.  I have since stoped and now I'm on a different medicine which I'm not sure is going to be any better.  At first the doctor wouldn't believe these symptons were from the Toprol until I forced the issue.",3
"I have been taking Toprol XL for about 5 years. When they came out with the generic last year I was switched to the generic Metroprol. This medication was prescribed for high blood pressure. It has no effect on the blood pressure, but does slow the heart rate down and make the heart beat with less force. It seems the side effects increased with the change to Metoprolol. I also take an ACE inhibitor and an Alpha  blocker, Terazosin. The Alpha blocker is the only medication that has lowered the pressure much at all, but still too high and the effect only lasts for 3-4 hours. I have Diastolic Heart Failure and Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) with some Atheriosclerosis. These 2 conditions lead to a reduced blood flow rate. All of the traditional antihypertensive medications make the flow rate even lower and are mostly ineffective in reducing the blood pressure. The internal organs sense the reduced flow rate as a reduction in oxygen in the blood stream and do everything they can to raise the flow rate, which usually exceeds the effect of the medication and the blood pressure goes back up. So those of you that have unsatisfactory pressure reduction and side effects from your medications, look at the symptoms of low blood pressure and you will find they match your side effects. You probably have diastolic dysfunction, your heart does not allow enough blood into the chambers to be pumped out. Good luck convincing your doctor to even consider this possibility, it goes against what they were taught in Med School. Also there are no procedures for this or medications. Exercise, weight deduction, limiting salt intake help lower pressure, but do little to increase the flow rate.",2
"Iam a 40 year old female with high blood pressure.Used to take 25mg of generic toprol xl by sandoz and it made my toes feel numb and my legs and hips hurt all the time.Switched to 25mg of generic by ethenex and one month later I feel great,no more aches, pains, or numbness. It really does make a difference which manufacturer you go with.",5
I THOUGHT IT WAS ME.  I HAVE GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT AND COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I EVEN JOINED A GYM AND STILL GAINED. MY HUSBAND NOW CALLS ME FAT.

"I am a 21 year-old female that has been on this medication for almost a year. A little over a year ago, I began randomly fainting. I assumed it was just low blood sugar the first few times and did not seek medical attention. After the fainting became more frequent and began to worry me, I decided to go to the doctor. It took months of tests and several missed college classes, but I was finally diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome and put on this medication. Since I have taken it, I have not fainted, because my blood pressure and heart rate have regulated(their irregularity is what was causing the fainting). I have only experienced minor side effects from the medication, such as crazy dreams and very minor weight gain(which may be associated with getting older and not having a teenage metabolism anymore), but overall the benefits have far out-weighed the side effects for me! I'm not the type of person who takes medication for everything, in fact, I rarely take medication for anything, so being told that I may have to take this pill for the rest of my life was very scary to me. But, if it keeps me standing upright, I guess ""I gotta do what I gotta do"".",5

"still have irregular heartbeat and some angina, but i am better on than off.",3
My husband has been taking this med for almost four years. He has no sex drive or desire at all. He's been using it for irregular heartbeat. The med does it's job  but the sacrifice is huge considering he's only 42. his cardio doc refuses to listen at all.,2
"I was placed on 100mg of Toprol about a year ago. I started noticing stomach pain,heartburn,& gas. The longer I am on it the worse it seems to be getting. I was thinking it was something else causing the problem, but testing was negative. I was not having any problems other than high blood pressure, until I started on this drug. Now I have noticed I am starting to gain back weight that had been lost. I am seeing a new dr. on Monday. You can't go through your daily duties with feeling this way..",2

Made my feet feel like they have ice water in them and they are either numb or tingling. Also the medicine also makes my heart feel like it is tightening up and beat real fast.  I have problems with walking if I take the medicine within few hours of taking Toprol.  It leaves a metal taste in my mouth all the time.  It has never lowered my blood pressure.  In fact it keeps my blood pressure at 165-169. I took this medicine from January to August 2008.  I started out at 50mg then upped to 100mg then upped to 200mg(which I refused to take). I wished that I have never let the doctor talk me into taking this medicine as I was doing a lot better before taking it.  Now I have problems that I didn't have before.  Diet is a better way to go and that is what I am doing. No more drugs for me.,1
"I am taking this for fast, pounding irregular heartbeats, due to a redundent heart valve, diagnosed from an echo-gram. It has worked great. I have been on it now for about 10 months and recently, the past month or so, am expierencing extreme fatigue and low blood pressure. Has anyone ever had these problems? I am glad the medication is working and I have no choice but to keep taking it, but I have got to get some energy back!! I work full time and have two teenage sons and a husband, so that tells you, I have got to get my SPUNK back. I use to be so entergetic and go from sun up to sun down. I know age slows us down and I am 44, but this is much more than that! Is there anything that can counter act the fatigue and low blood pressure?, if so please respond. thanks",5
"While this drug did help with anxiety and bp I've had some bad side effects and insisted on switching meds with my Dr.  I've gained 15 lbs in a 4 months. I've also been feeling depressed, had a low sex drive and the worst part is the HAIR LOSS!  Thankfully the side effects describe it as reversible.  ",3

side affects the problem,4
Been on 12.5 Mg for over 2 years and the AF has been the same with each EKG but lately I have experienced fatigue or lack of energy.My Cardio said to see the head of Cardiology Prof at RW Johnson and he said it was the toprol that I am on to control the Atrial Fib and asked if I wanted a thalium stress test to prove it wasn't blockage. I have 50% for over 2 years. ,4
started toprol 25mg and had to increase to 50mg because bp not down. Cardiologist changed to 100mg and Hyzaar and have had very few side effects. Got dizzy when I started taking it but Dr. told me to take it before bed and it helped. Also bothered by sweating and weight gain. Have a feeling the side effects may have to do with the combination of other drugs with Toprol.,5
since using toprolxL I have not had any episode of a-fib the only negative effects are losing hair (not all) and weight gain of 35 pounds in the middle . I try not to eat any bad foods.It seems imposible to lose weight that I never had before.  ,5

It has controlled my heart from racing and has relieved my anxiety.,5
"This medication works well. However, as the warning reads, don't stop taking it cold turkey. I had an ocassion where I ran out of the RX and couldnt get it refilled immediately.The results were that I couldn't walk one block without stoping to rest. I felt tired, dizzy and some minor pains in my chest doing the most simplest of things like standing or a short walk to the kitchen. Becareful ! ",5
Over the two years that I have been taking this Topral XL 50 I have gained 40 pds.  I have been VERY CAREFUL about the food I eat and still have gained weight.  I am very upset about this.  ,5

"I absolutely love this...I would generally have a 24/7 head ache where my blood vessels spasm which causes them to tighten and block the blood flow to my brain.

"I have been taking Toprol XL 50 for 3 yrs. for pre-hypertension - 140/90.  Now average 120/70.  Switched to metoprolol generic recently, no differences noted.  I love this stuff for the positive side effects:  greatly reduced anxiety and I am not as quick to anger as before.  In my profession I frequently speak before large audiences and occasionally do live or taped television interviews.  With metoprolol my performance anxiety (stage fright) is now gone.  I have not experienced any negative side effects from this medication.",5

I still run high but nothing like before.  My qt intervals are somewhat shorter now, but still must be VERY careful when taking any new meds OC, or Dr.  I guess these crazy dreams I have now are from this, I have also noticed I perspire much more now and stay hot all the time???? I will continue to take this as directed...",4
"I have found that the 25 mg 1x daily has lowered my bp. Any weight gain is due to my lack of exercise which I should be doing. I do feel tired, but I think that is due to the lack of exercise. I am wondering how many who wrote of feeling tired and low energy are overweight and do not do enough exercise-walking 3x week (I know, I just don't always do.). However, I have felt weak and lightheaded, but I wonder if it was caused by my eating foods that had sodium in it (visiting family & friends, eating what they eat; going out and eating in restaurants who salt the food even if you request that they don't). When I control my food preparation and use either no salt or low salt seasoning, my bp is fine.  If I get adequate water that is important.  I am trying to take my medication on time, do not drink any alcoholic beverages and cook with salt or with very low salt seasonings. I do some walking.   I do have some numbness in my hands when I sleep on them-but I will pay attention to if it happens when I am not sleeping or lying on them.  Sometimes I get a rebound headache-but again, I think that happens when I am not drinking enough water. If I am drinking water-not just liquids-I don't seem to have those problems.  But all the comments are very helpful, and I can be on the lookout for things that may occur.  Overall, I am satisfied with the way the medication works.",5
"I started taking Toprol XL when i was 19 for problems with my heart racing since then my heart has slowed down but after taking only 25 mg , im having to move up to 50 mg , so now im a little concerned that my body may stop responding to this med hopefully not, but so far this medicine has been great in controlling my heart rate i recommend people that have the same problem give this medicine a try being a little tired for the med is way better than feeling like youve been running for 2 hours by the way your heart is running with you! Good luck to everyone who has this same condition!!",4

I was started on Inderal, so I can't blame all the lack of energy on just the Toprol XL. I would much rather have my hbp under control with Toprol XL and experience lack of energy than to do without it.",5
"I have taken this medicine for just over 6 years for severe palpitiations and rapid heart rate.  I would say that my symptoms have improved overall by about 90 - 95%.

"Taking Toprol XL 25 mg for PVCs and Ventricular tachycardia, after having an ablation for SVT. It makes me tired, disrupts my sleep, and dizzy. It controls my PVCs, but not the VT. I have gained 5 lbs in a month! I am going to see the Dr. to switch medications this week",3
"Toprol-XL is sooooo bad for a person that it should NOT be used. I have--gained 50-pounds;badly swollen feet and ankles;rash and itching on ankles,feet and legs;extreme fatigue and sleepy;cannot drink alcohol or I am narcoleptic;severe shortness of breath; depression;and--my doctor does not believe me and thinks it is the only med. to use and that works, so she (and my cardio dr.) just says, ""just use it."" I think my local drug pharmacist could better prescribe. Have taken it for maybe 6-years for h.b.p.;heart and tremors--I think it makes the tremors worse. Have not felt like myself (or felt good) since taking it. Don't know what to do. Any good suggestions by dr.;pharmacist;public would be appreciated. You can refer to me as-- HELP B.S.  ",4
"I was first given the 25 mg of generic blood pressure was still elevated, light headed, and lower headaches just above the neck. Doctor then gave me full 25 mg, blood pressure avg 117/75, pulse high end of 60's, however I still have the headaches.  Cold, my feet are always cold! ",3
"I am taking Topral xl (50 mil)once a day. I was persriped this medicine for butterfly feelings that I was having in my chest.My heart doctor told me this could be happening becasue of stress or it could be a hormonal thing. I am very afraid whenever I have this rapid beating going on. I never thought that I would be 46 yrs. old and taking heart medicine. I do not take life for granted, life is a beautiful thing. I pray for good health for all of us.",4
Caused shortness of breath and fatigue to the point that I thought I was very depressed; was given antidepressants and taken off Toprol - then the troubls really began.  This is the second time Toprol has been prescribed and the shortness of breath was a factor each time.  I was surprised when it was prescribed again about 1.5 years ago.  Now on other meds that manage the BP - feeling much better.,4
"also have heart probs,started me on 50 mb then to 100. taking toprol xl for 4 yrs now. tired and weight gain of 30 lbs. great concern is my loss of oxygen or something makes my voice sound like i have aged 40 years and I am already 63. Also taste and smell have almost gone over the last three. Saw that problem posted and never thought of meds doing that just thought it was my age. Any one know about the taste and smell thing. I go to a clinic (no ins) the doctors at this clinic can't be bothered with side effects.",4
Had tightness in upper chest all the time. After exercising would have a hard time breathing if I took Toprol.  Not so bad when stopped taking Toprol.  Had 85% clog in circumflex artery and the Toprol slowed down my pulse and caused the problem.  My doctor did not want me to stop taking it but when I saw a cardiologist he said quit taking it as it was slowing down the blood to my heart because it lowered my pulse and he put a stent in the artery.  Told me my blood pressure was ok.  I had a blood pressure monitor at home and my blood pressure was averaging 120/70.  Be careful what your doctor tells you-see a cardiologist!,1

I do have trouble sleeping, but I am someone who, if I awake in the middle of the night, has a racing mind that will not shut down.  I have noticed if I miss my doses for a couple of days the palpitations begin again.",4
"I have had too many side effects to name. Mainly a weird lightheaded feeling. It goes away when I don't take the pill though. I am going to see my dr this week, and hopefully she will allow me to discontinue. A cardiologist prescribed this med at the ER. Had heart palpitations. He thought I was crazy. Some people are ok on this med. Just like with the thalium stress tests, they say if you are older than 60 you had no adverse reaction. I am 33, and feel like I am 80 since I've been taking this med. Yeah my palpitations are gone, but I feel like I am going to pass out all the time. I would much rather have palpitations! I wish everyone good luck on this med.",2

"NOT a good medication for people with ASTHMA I was put on Toprol XL 5 years ago after having a stent. I was recently hospitalized with very bad shortness of breath, went through a battery of tests and numerous Doctors. After 2 months of this FINALLY a Dr. in Miami told me that some people with Asthma and taking Toprol XL have this reaction. I have been weaned off and am finally feeling better and able to go back to work.",1
because of fast heart rate and HP I am taking this but I still have some fast heart rate.,3
"I also take this med (25 mg) for migraine prevention.  Generic was working for headaches(went from daily migraines to 6-8 a month), but wasn't controlling my atrial fib.

"I've been taking Toprol XL (50mg) for about 2 yrs.  It appears to be working for me as I don't feel the palpitations anymore however I have gained about 20# and feel that it is from the Toprol.  My cardiologist said she had never heard of people gaining weight by taking it but in reading some of the other folks comments, it appears that I am not the only one who has experienced weight gain. With that exception....I am pleased with the drug.",4

"I cannot take a full 50 mg tablet or even half a tablet; it slows my heart rate way down and makes my heartbeat irregular, and I feel very dizzy.  I have been taking 1/4 of a tablet every third day, with supper, and that lowers my blood pressure without the adverse effects.  I am 70 years old and weigh about 95 pounds.  It would be very helpful if this medication could be made available in 12.5 milligram tablets; currently, I have to cut a whole 50 mg tablet in 4 quarters.  People come in different sizes and so should medications.",3
"Dizzy, lack of sex drive, touble sleeping,short of breath, and bad dreams",2
After the initial period o getting used to a slower heartbeat. I am satisfied with the drug and its efficacy.,4

It has slowed my heartbeat down.,3
I think this medication works well. But you must take it everyday. if you happen to skip a dose or two. Start taking it right away if not you may experience  irregular heart beats.,5
I have been on this medication for about 4 months and my blood pressure is ok when I am not under alot of stress but my breathing (asthma) seems to have worsened. I have mentioned this on several occasions to my doctor but all he says is to continue using my inhaler every 4-6 hours and it doesn't seem to be working for me just seems to be getting worse. I am trying to get him to put me on a different medication but he has the same excuse everytime.,3
Works very well.  I have chest pains if I don't take it.  Symptoms very mild.  Tried the generic and had bad symptoms.  I immediately went back to  Toprol.,5

          I fell a little better.,4
"I hate this medication, it has given me nightmares for over a year and I dont even remember what its like to sleep properly anymore. In terms of doing what its supposed to do I guess it does that, I dont have high blood pressure or angina and never have, but being on this  has made my blood pressure border line low like 90/60 which results in dizzyness sometimes. It has also made my eyesight worse, so now I wear reading glasses.",4

A weight gain of about 3 pounds since I've been taking this drug. (about 2 months). Unknown if this is realted to the drug. My b/p has lowered quite a bit.,3
"I just switched from lisinopril to metoprolol ER 50 mgs in an attempt to control what has become very frequent Premature Ventricular Complexes (PVCs).  I have only been on it a week but it is definitely helping with the palpitations.  However, I notice some chest pain, moderate headaches at night and shortness of breath at end of day.  I hope these side effects will go away in time, assuming they are caused by the med.  ",4
"My doctor prescribed this medication for high blood pressure and heart problems.  I have experienced tightness in the chest, fatigue, severe jaw and arm pain.  I stopped taking it about a week about and I feel much better.

"MY DR. RECENTLY PRESCRIBED TOPROL-XL, 25 MG, AS A TREATMENT FOR HIGH ANXIETY, STRESS AND FAST HEART RATE.  SO FAR, IT SEEMS TO BE HELPING WITH MY HIGH ANXIETY AND INSOMNIA, BUT IT HAS CHANGED THE TASTE OF FOOD AND CIGARETTES, WHICH IS GOOD IN A WAY.  I AM ALSO, EXPERIENCING NAUSEA, SWEATING AND DIZZINESS.  I DO PLAN TO KEEP TAKING IT AND HOPE THAT THE SIDE EFFECTS WILL SUBSIDE.",3

may cause rapid pulse rate.mine went to 116.,3
I have noticed since I have been on Toprol XL for the past 4-5 months I have headaches almost on a daily basis and frequent bouts of shortness of breath. I believe this is due to the medication since I wasn't experiencing this prior to taking it. I also notice that event though I am on this medicine 50mg. in the morning and 25mg. in the evening my BP tends to get higher in the evening if I am at work or working.,3
"When this drug is first started there are many odd effects.  Crazy vivid dreams.  Not being able to remember what you have just done.  Waking up in a panic knowing you are late to do somethng, you just cant remember what.  The 2 times per day extended release is a betterchoice than the regular 3 times per day version.",4
Toprol is controlling my bp well. It does make me a bit sleepy.,5
My palpitations completely stopped.  It does make me tired so I take it at night.,3
I have gained 15-20 lbs.,5

My systolic is high and my diastolic is low,3
WEIGHT GAIN IS A PROBLEM FOR ME,4
"long yerm use, very effective ",5
My blood pressure is normal and chest pain is better.,5
"First and only medicine I have been on for over 20 years, same dosage over all this time. No side effects ever noticed. Originally started on brand name Mavik, been using generics since they came on market.",5
Side effect of this drug for me has been a mild dry cough which appears to be increasing over time.,4
"I was on 4mg once a day for 2 years. I experienced palpitations, shortness of breath and migraines. I initiaally was on this drug with Verapamil. At that time the side effects were at there worse. Things got better once the Verapamil was stopped although still not back to normal. Switched doctor and changed meds. Now on Lisinopril for 2 weeks. Highly recommend DASH diet and exercise to reduce meds. ",4
Taking 2mil for over a year. Blood pressure reduced to normal range. No seriuos side effects.,4
i started taken this med 3 months ago is working good so far.,4
"After being on this medication I have had  swelling of the face and lip, this has happened twice. at a 4mg dose",3
"take 3 times daily.  other than urine stink, no issues.",4
"I've been on Tribenzor for over five years. There have been no directly attributable side effects. My BP is steady at 120-130 over ~80. I had swelling of one leg before taking the drug, and I have swelling of one leg now. I tried other BP medication prior to starting on Tribenzor and had a variety of side effects, none of which were acceptable. Any changes in physical ability or mental acuity I've experienced since beginning treatment with Tribenzor could just as easily be addressed as ""simply getting older,"" or the natural effects of aging. For me, this medication has been helpful and clearly of benefit.",5
 I started taking Tribenzor when my blood pressure was 200/120. It helps lower my blood pressure back to normal levels within the first month. It certainly helps lowering blood pressure. But I have experienced a side effect not listed on this drug. I have contracted Raynaudâ??s syndrome.  The reason I know this is because I contracted it with in the first month of taking this medicine. I lost my insurance for two years so I couldnâ??t take it and my Raynauds went away. Last year I got my insurance back and started taking Tribenzor again. My Raynaudâ??s syndrome came back with full force. I cannot take this medicine again.  Raynaudâ??s syndrome causes blood vessels to shrink making your fingertips toes and nose and tongue turn white and feel numb. If you are experiencing this check with your doctor. ,5
"I tied tribenzor for 2 weeks, I was also on a diabetic pill which is not suppose to be taking together. Tribenzor will mask your sugar dropping, this also made me nervous, nausea, joint pain. Doctor has recently switched my bp med. This did how ever keep my bp down. I couldn't handle the side effects",5
"Taking this drug for 3 years now. I have mixed feelings about it. Yes, my B/P is reasonable, in the 130's over 70's/80's, with a pulse in the mid/high 50's. The cost is very high - I'm on 40-5-12.5 mg. - even though I'm on Medicare. Side effects: hard to determine about hair lose as I age, but it is thinning; leg hair is almost all gone, bowel movements 2-3 times per day; leg cramps if I don't take in fluids; up twice a night to urinate - no prostrate issue my doctor says. Concerned about long term usage with this or any drug. Have tried other B/P drugs, had dizziness, low energy levels, and frequent cough on others. ",5
Before taking Tribenzor my BP was 181/99 or higher. My Doctor prescribe this medication and i feel so alive. I call this pill my miracle pill ,5
No side issues on for one year blood pressure in complete control,1
Been using it now for 3 weeks and my blood pressure is back to normal 115/65 today.  It was running 165/80 or less for about a month.  I had used diovan hct for over 10 years so think I just needed a change.  My blood pressure was good until about 3 months before I started the tribenzor and it just started being high every time I took it.  Hope this keeps working.,4
"I used to take Diovan before I started this medicine but my BP was still high (155/78 to 185/90). I started Tribenzor about a month ago and it really works well for me. My daily pressure runs between 117/76 to 130/80 even after running around all day. I haven't had any side effects other than the first two days after starting this medication, I was getting palpitations which I contributed to the fact that my BP was very high.",5
"It lowered BP too low. I wound up being dizzy and lightheaded even when lying down, toes tingled, had trouble wetting, and had confusion and started freaking on the job.  Had to be driven to ER.  It lowered body salts. Was given an IV and left hospital feeling better. I craved fresh fruit for a week and ate 2 big boxes of blackberries and half dozen bananas for the next three days",5
"If you are allergic to drugs containing sulfur, do not take this drug. I had a severe allergic reaction to this drug because of the sulfur....my entire body felt like it was tingling all over.",4
"I used Benicare 40/25 before, never my BP went down, plus I urinated like a crazy, I did not like.  Trebenzor, on the other side, my BP went down quick and stay there basically for 24 hours. No urination anymore. Do I recommend  this medication? Yes, of course. ",5
" Lowered b/p, but after 3 weeks vision became blurry, very frequent urination and extreme thirst, soar throat, dizziness, very low energy. Had to stop last week, but symptoms have yet to go away.",3
kneck pain,2
"This is the second review the first was after a week, I had some leg cramps at that time.  Now,(one month)  I have experience sleepiness, shoulder pain, neck pain, leg cramps, and possibly some I have not associated yet to this drug.  Blood pressure is great, at times maybe even low. Tomorrow I am calling my doctor to see if he thinks I could break this pill in half.",5
"My blood pressure is great at this this time. But I think I am expriencing, dry mouth at night, as a side affect.",4
I have been on this medication for a short time and it has lowed my pressure and I don't feel any side effect.  But the cost is a concern.  ,5
"EXTREME HAIR LOSS, COLD LIKE SYMPTONS EVERY MONTH, SWELLING IN HANDS AND FEET, CONTINOUSLY THIRSTY, HEADACHES",1
"On tribenzor for 8 months, BP went down, expirience dizziness,short of breath,no energy, allways tired, shoulder pain, joints pain,sometimes i fill i will faint.Have to see my doctor again...",4
"I have been taking tribenzor for 3 months and my blood pressure has been much better.  I have leg muscle cramps at different times of the day and swollen ankles.  But overall, it has helped lower my blood pressure.",4
"Only been taking for 120 days, but BP is best ever, actually a little low.  No side-effects that I am aware of yet.",5
"My blood pressure was shy high before I started taking this drug. Now, my blood pressure has been slightly lower than normal for the last two years. Great medication!",5
"I started taking this medication in September of 2011. By October I started experiencing extreme shortness of breathe. By December of 2011 I was experiencing chest pain, swelling in ankles and legs and pain in shoulder and arms. I also started experiening muscle cramps and having no sex drive. Hair loss/thinning came a couple of months later. In 2013 I suffered a mild heart attack while on this medication. No longer taking Tribenzor and I am feeling a lot better since doctor took me off this medication. ",1
" BP 120/70 now.   My pulse became high within two days of taking Tribenzor. I was previously taking Bystolic, and others. I  continued Bystolic low dose every other day with Tribenzor for two weeks to lower my pulse.  My pulse is getting lower as I continue to take tribenzor alone. ",5
I have been on a lot of medicine for b/p but this the worst one yet dihere lost of hair swelling there isn't anything I can say  good for  this drug,3
"My third review: I have been on tribenzor for 2 1/2 years now, the only lasting side effects I have had are leg cramps at night, caused by dehydration, just have to drink more water, can't be out in the sun for too long, results in easy burn and headaches,occasional shortness of breath, occasional constipation, once again have to drink more water. I have ""not"" had any hair loss. In 2 years I have lost and kept off 70 lbs., altered my diet, you should always take the pill with food. But the key here is always water. Keep hydrated, especially in summer, try to match input with output. Gatorade is a good supplement. In short the med works fine for me. You just have to help it by helping yourself, alter habits, diet and exercise. Good luck to all.",5
I have been on this drug for almost 2 yrs. now and my blood pressure is doing well. I started off with 210/115 and it came down to 120/75 within a week. I experience a little dizzyness and it does bother my stomach in the morning after I take it and it does last for an hour or more. ,5
"I can't really rate the effectiveness, I took only ONE dose of this.  It was the drug from ""H.""  I was dizzy, had a headache, my eye balls ached, I had diarrhea and nausea and joint pain.  Within a few days I had bronchitis and my shoulder hurt.  The bronchitis and shoulder pain, which I thought was bursitis, took a couple of days to manifest.  Everything else appeared within several hours and disappeared 24 to 30 hours after the dose. A horrible, horrible medication. ",3
  I have been on this medication for two years now.When I first started taking BP was 194/101.Now my Bp runs 120/86. I had tried several medications before Tribenzor but none was successful. After reading side affects I was a afraid but I needed help.I have had No side affects from this medication.I am very happy to take one pill a day and have starting walking and loosing weight,5
"It works well at controlling my blood pressure, but I sometimes have numbness and tingling up and down both arms and across my chest.  The numbness is accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness.  I also sometimes have trouble sleeping in spite of being on prescription sleeping pills (doxepin), which worked well before I started taking tribenzor.",5
After trying several medications this worked well in bringing down my BP.  The problem is that after about a week I was so depressed I couldn't stand it. Stopped taking it and depression went away.,4
"on BP med for a year after replacement valve surgery, worked well for me bp 125/85, no swelling,no breathing problems,no pain, had significant hair loss. I was pleased all three in one pill.  ",4

"After trying several BP meds, my Doc put me on Tribenzor.  My BP dropped from 160-170/120-135 to around 120/80.  Last time I saw him it was 106/60.  No side effects. Been on it for approx. 2 years.",5

Beware this drug!!",3
"I had 160/120 bp prior to getting the doses.After a month on the med, I am 110/70, however my resting heart rate used to be 70 know its 100-120. I am great shape and exercise at 5 days a week 2 twice a day. Power-lifter.  ",5

I have slight swelling of ankles and feet, stomach cramps, and a great deal of hair loss. The hair loss is upsetting me greatly.  Does anyone know if this hair loss stops? My blood pressure has gone from 190/80 to 118/68.  I guess my choice is to be bald or be infirmed!!",5
"After trying this medication for two months the results were no different for lowering my blood pressure than taking Lisinopril.  Actually the Lisinopril worked better in that there were no ill side effects as with the Tribenzor such as edema in the legs, ankles, feet, face, lips, and eyes.  Dizziness and headaches were also associated with the use of this drug.",2
works better than anything else I tried,5
"I am in my 2nd year of using Tribenzor, and a few months ago my hair started thinning out. I am not sure that is the cause, but I have never had this problem before. This medication has worked wonderful for my blood pressure.",5

Just after 7 days it is down to 119/81 which is where my BP used to be.  I'm very happy to feel like my old-self again.  The only side-effect I've noticed is sun sensitivity. (I should be wearing sunscreen anyway.)",4
"Four months ago I started this drug at 20-5-12.5, I felt lightheaded and dizzy, my BP went from 160/87 down to 112/69. Doc said to cut the pill in half so I did. BP had stabilized since then. Side effects: I am losing a lot of hair, I am experiencing shoulder joint pain that, to open the car door to get out made me cry, (the pain is terrible but is not always), knee pain, and just recently my rt leg was swollen from the ankle to the knee after I walked 5 miles that day. I was to see my doctor yesterday but the swelling is gone after 2 days. If stiffness and joint pain persists I will have to see my doctor and possibly change to a different medication.",4
It's easy to take and seems as effective as any other BP meds I have taken.  It is too high to pay for without the one year introductory card provided by the manufacturer ( $25 for each month's supply). I won't be able to afford it after the first year.  Other meds have worked just as well - I took this one because I changed doctors and he wanted to try the samples on me thinking it might work well.  It works fine but no better than the others,4
"So far, this medication has really help lower my high blood pressure.",4
"On it 6 months now and will soon go to doctor the talk about it and do blood work. Lowered pressure from 160/90 to 119/77. I don't like the effects of the diuretic. I wake up with cracked lips and tire easily when working out of doors in heat, no sweat. I live in FL. I plan to talk with my doctor about taking the drugs separately without the diuretic.",5
I have had extremely high blood pressure over 170/110 and lisinopril was not working. I switched to this one and the second day it was down to 140/90 and the third day it was 124/78....Awesome!  I feel better and less swollen. Today is the 4th day and Im still fine...hopefully I will not notice any side effects as the days go by but so far I feel like a new person!!! :),5
"I took this medication once daily for 6 days. It did lower my blood pressure approximately 10 points both systolic and diastolic. However I was awakened at night with severe muscle cramps in legs and feet and developed muscles twitching in my arms and hands during the daytime which lasted the entire time that I took this medication. My doctor had me discontinue this and return to my previous meds.  The muscle cramps in my lower extremities immediatly stopped but I still have the twitching in my arms, some 3 weeks later, which I never had before with any other medication. PROS: does lower blood pressure. CONS: attacks the muscles. Definitely not worth the risk, at least for me.",2
"Have been on this med for about 2 months.  It has definitely helped lower my BP, but I have experiencedjoint pains and now an itchy rash.  Will need to visit MD again.",4
"immediate reduction in blood presure, but elevated heart rate... I work outside in So. FL.  Heart rate may be related to getting my blod to the skin surface for cooling.  I don't know.  Just had blood work, will see my DR. in a week or so and discuss it.  BTW I'm 58 6' tall very large frame & 230 lbs.  Could stand to loose 25-35 LBS and am working on it (down from 257)",5
I used to to take Amlodipine and suffered aches and pains.  I told the dolctor and with a separate pill for water retention(Hydrochlorot)i began to feel great.  I was fine then the doctor recommended I combine them by taking Tribenzor.  Now i feel the aches and pains again. My sex drive has dimiished even more. ,3
Do NOT take this medicine without food.  First three times I took this medicine (between meals) my BP went to >200/110.  Started taking it with meal - no spike in BP.,4
sleepy all the time no energy,2
"I have been on this B/P med for 4 months. Excellent med keeps my B/P at a constant low ranging from 90/70 to 106/62. Where previous it was HIGH ranging from 170/100 to 190/106. I too experience some lightheadness, some tiredness and dizziness. However, I recently found out through a fasting blood test that this med may be affecting my kindey functions. After reviewing the possible/rare side effects of this med I discovered that    this med can cause kidney diease and/or kidney failure. I will need to review other B/P med options with my MD any get off this med as it is causing my Creatine levels to be out of the normal range. Normal range is .59-1.07. I am currently at 1.50. Which means if these numbers continue to increase  to 2.0 only 50% of my kindeys will be working. Not good and very scarey. Not all meds are good for you, even though they do the job! Be aware and always stay on top of all your meds and possible/rare side effects that can cause damage down the road and or possible death.",5
"Have been nervous or jittery, wondering if this is from the drug",5
"Excellent for me.  Been trying everything. BP dropped from 170-180/100 to 120 /80.   Hacking cough, but will continue b/c results so positive.  Slight lightheadedness, but able to work out 5 x week. Also taking 50mg atenelol which is excellent combo.",5
This medicine gave me a hacking cough to the point that I thought I had a cold. I used the med for approx 45 days with no great results. I got an ache in my shoulder that was numbing. Med is a big zero.,2
"over-all just made me feel better  more energy,",5
"I was diagnose hypertensive at age 57  4 years ago. My doctor put me on several medications to control my high blood pressure, (5) to be more precis about it. That is about 1+ per year and finally ""Tribenzor"" ! It has so far been the most effective for me. Be patient, don't get frustrated. I was told in the beginning it might be several different drugs until they level your pressure and it did in fact take a while,WOW Finally Tribenzor.",5
Been on this medication for 7 days.  BP 139/73 .... better results than most meds.  Two side effects...muscle cramps and chest pains.  Took two excedrin on fifth day and they went away.  This is the sixth day and so far no side effects.  I love the way I feel..energy..good mood..  Hope it continues.,4
Do experience shortness of breath. Have been on it for 3 weeks and biggest complaint is very low sexual desire.,3
"Updating a previous review, only lasting side effect with me is night cramps in leg (due to low water intake)but just have to keep hydrated. I am going into my 8th month and averaging 117/77, right after a walk average 132/80 with a fast recovery. ",5
"After 2 weeks of taking this drug, I've broken out in a painful, itchy rash. It has helped to lower my high blood pressure, but now I have to stop it, take Benadryl, then restart this medicine to make sure it is causing the rash.",5
"I've been taking this med for 2 weeks now, which is a little too soon for a lot of side effects to start. The main ones so far are hair loss, neck pain, blurred vision, and shortness of breath. My readings are running 130/78. Will review again after a month. My readings were better with the Benicar HCT, with no hair loss.",4
swallow feet tiredness,5
weekness and fainting,2
"I have been taking this medicine for approximately 3 months and am extremely happy with the results.  The first two weeks I took it, I lost 10 lbs.  I have not felt this good in years.  My BP was 145/92, now it is a steady 115/75. Sometimes I feel a little light-headed, but overall no major complaints. ",5
"Took this medication for three days and had to stop because of excrutiating muscle aches.  I felt like I was catching the flu.  I was also dizzy and very, very fatigued.  BP dropped to 85/60 which is too low.  I will have to try another medication",2
"BP DOWN TO 116/70. SOME DIZZINESS,SOME TENDERNESS IN CHEST . ONLY BEEN 3WEEKS BUT A LITTLE TOO GOOD. MALE 58, WAS 150/95. TRYING THIS SINCE AVALIDE RECALL",5
EWH636...THE BLOOS PRESSURE IS DOWN TO 119/80...NO SIDE EFFECTS!!! MY DOC WAS AMAZED!!!,5
"Was at 150/95 prior to taking Tribenzor, 20/5/12.5 mg, its the most effective BP med i have ever taken...been on it 3 weeks my bp is now perfect 120/80 with no side effects...watch out for metoprolol i had a hell of a time stopping it...chect pains and anxiety...was an aweful experience",5
"it has lowered my BP so far, but I'ved experienced some hair loss.",4
"This pill is easy enough to swallow and it does control bp, but the swelling of feet and hands and other side effects are not acceptable. I will have to try another med. Not a good choice for me.",3
i am 41 years old...only been taking this ned for 2 days. so far my top number has dropped from 180 to 145....my bottom number is steady at 100 or 101. i walk during the week at 3.5 miles to 4.5 miles each walk. kettle bells as well!!!! i will give another review in a few days!! E.W.,3
severe cramps,3
"Going into my 3rd month. I can walk 1 1/2 mile and have a reading of 137/78 when before I could not walk half a block without it being 178/100. Side effects that have subsided were anxiety and high bp spikes. Current side effects dizziness,low bp, constipation(mostly due to dehydration)minor chest pain and shortness of breath(mostly while sitting for periods(goes away when i get up and walk around)minor short lived headaches, and dry mouth cough. My Dr. feels these are alright since my last visit he gave me a scrip for 11 more months and said see you in a year. But over all has been doing the job. I have adjusted my diet, and take daily 30 minute walks. I have gone from 270 lbs. to 238 lbs. in the 2 months and still losing, also stopped drinking and smoking which helps alot. So if you have just started this, hang in there, it gets better. ",5
very lightheaded since i started taking it,4
"i am trying to find anyside effects,and or conflicts with other medicine.",3
"Have been on it for about 5 weeks now. BP has remained at about 150/84 varys up to 178/87. I have constant chest pain, periodic muscule spasms in chest area, redness in my lower legs that was temperary and has stayed now for over three weeks. My Doctor can see me later next week to address my concerns. I am scared about the chest pain. I would not try this again with out a Doctor's closer monitoring. I will quit it as soon as I can get advice how to! Have had Hypertension for years and have not been able to get under control. Need Help.",1
"I have been using Tribenzor for 3 wks with great results. My starting BP was 220/158 and within 2 wks a more normal average of 124/84 most of the time it's 118/78. Don't know if this has anything to do with the medicaiton but when I take a half a pill I get lower readings, my doctor can't figure that one out either so normally I just take half",5
I have been taking this pill for 5 days and my BP is still up 141/112. ,2
"THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS MEDICATION IS THAT I,M STARTING TO SEE A GREAT LOSS OF MY HAIR.",5
put on this medication for high blood pressure..did not work at all...pressure remained the same after one week! and no none told me about the recall..time to get a new physician...,1
"I'm so glad i had my 78 yo dad stop taking Valsartan, it was making his legs swell & trouble standing.  Now, 12/6/2018, there's a recall.  Just google:  Valsartan Recall. See my 2 links below.  https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/uc m613916.htm  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b Dz8KIQBhI",1
DID NOT CONTROL MY BLOOD PRESSURE AT ALL---MADE IT ERRATIC.,1
78 yr old female with stubborn BP. Drug very effective reducing  BP but experiencing back pain daily. I will get off of it when good replacement can b found.,5
"After taking valssrtan I felt like I was expanding. Gained 10lbs in 2 weeks, and had extreme headaches and swollen fingers, I stopped cold turkey and contacted my dr.i also would feel short of breath and my arms and hips felt weak.",1
"Dangerous drug, do not use.  After 6 months ended up in hospital with permanent kidney damage (stage 3), almost killed me. Two weeks prior, my family doctor was concerned that I was showing signs of Parkinson Disease (symptoms disappeared soon after getting off Valsartan). My healthy, active father-in-law (89) was on Valsartan from August to January.  He was hopitalized in January with kidney failure, he is now dialysis, and the prognosis for survival is not good. This drug is dangerous, do not take it, it will lead to your death.",1
Keeps my BP down in the 70/120 range. No bad side effects. Taking the 160 mg for about a year and very satisfied with it.,5
good results,5
"I was put on Valsartan at 80 mg/day at first, wasn't effective so DR. increased to 160 then 320. Even with the increase cannot regulate BP, dizzy when standing and have gained a severe amount of water weight and puffy face. Lately have been feeling weak and like my body is vibrating. ",2
"94yo father on this for over a year. Extreme dizziness but was not offered a solution by Dr. Eventually ended up in ER with very high potassium and kidney damage. If this had been addressed earlier, ???",3
After taking this medication I started feeling terrible without correlating it to this. I started having numbness/tingling in my arms and legs and overall joint/muscle pain/aches. My vision gets blurry and I've noticed I've had a hard time speaking clearly (almost like I'm drunk). I'm tired all the time and I wake up with huge bags under my eyes. I've also been retaining water like crazy....my feet were really swollen the other day and they hurt. My doctor was trying to help me save money but it's not worth feeling like crap every day. After reading other people's reviews I no longer think I'm crazy.,2
"took this drug for about 1 month.  Yes, it lowered my BP, but gave me pains in my calves like I pulled a muscle.  Got so bad I could barely walk.  Stopped taking this drug and problems with calves went away.",4
"It works, was on 80mg. However, I experienced tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing, extremely low heart rate (mid 40's), and could barely stay awake while driving. I really do prefer the pharmacodynamics of this drug vs. ACE-I or CCB. But I just can't deal with the side effects.  Stopped taking, could finally breath. I wonder if another drug in the same class would have the same problems (Atacand, Cozaar)?  Anyway, I still think ARBs are great, but this one made me feel really bad.",3
"After trying a number of drugs, I found Diovan-the perfect choice-no side effects (numb feet/head aches). Took it for 5+ years. Just last month HMSA refused to cover and my cost per month would be $600! Switched to Valsartan and have headaches and pain in arms. There is no way the generic is ""the same"" as Diovan-so very frustrated. ",3
I was on Benicar and was happy with it.  My co pay was $35 a month until the generic came out and dropped it to $10.  Unfortunately I had to change medications when my insurance changed and my copay on the generic skyrocketed to $60 a month.  The Valsartan works but not as well.,3
"After trying numerous BP meds I have found Valsartin HCTZ 320/12.5 to work for me without causing ankle swelling.  I have been using it for at least 10 years, and I am well-satisfied.",5
Have been taking blood pressure medication for many years. Valsartan is by far the most effective medication I have ever taken to date. I have no side effects other than it works and works better than any other I've been on. Consistently all day every day 120's over 60's has me very happy.,5
"Was on Valsartan for 6 months, for high blood pressure. This has to be one of the most dangerous drugs out there.  I experienced achs and pains everywhere, especially in my back and hips.  I have been a weight lifer and exercise nut my whole life, but this drug made my legs so weak that I could not get up out of a chair without help. When I walked I shuffled my feet (unable to lift my legs as I walked).  My legs, arms and legs swelled, I gained 20 lbs (water weight).  My speech became so slurred that my wife thought I had a stroke.  In September I visited my family doctor, my condition was so bad he set me up to be tested for Parkinsons Disease (don't have it). In October I ended up in the hospital, almost dead.  I was being monitored 24/7 because they thought my heart was going to stop. The doctor asked my why I was taking Valsartan, he said that it was causing my body a lot of problems.  He asked if I had been monitored for kidney functions while taking the drug.  I had not. The Doctor said that I should have been monitored with a blood test at least once a month. My kidneys were only functioning at 40% because of Valsartan. At the hospital I was taken off Valsartan and given Toprol.  All my bad symptems from Valsartan have disappeared and my Kidney functions have improved. I have encountered three other people on Valsartan and they are all having bad side effects.  If you are on it, get off of it now before it ruins your life. ",3
"I'm 54 and my first time taking B/P med valsartan 40 mg, my B/P fluctuate, having serious head aches joint pains. my Dr. change it to Ramipril where my headaches and joint pains are diminishing slowly.I would not recommend it  ",1
Been on Diovan for years with no problems. Then Fallon Health tells me have to go with Valsarten (Generic) or they won't pay. B/P can be erratic at times on Valsarten. Wish I could go back to Diovan but can't. ,3
I was on Diovan for 14 years and did very well. Had to change to Valsartan because United Healthcare won't cover Diovan. I am experiencing daily headaches. I do not feel well on the generic. ,3
"I experienced a heaviness that felt like I had a boulder on my head and was walking around with it.  Also some dizziness, and MAJOR aches and pains in arms and legs, and bad headaches.  ONE DAY after getting off of Valsartin, I was back to normal, except the leg and arm shooting pains continue, but with less and less frequency.  I have been on Diovan for years without issue. I believe this is a BAD DRUG and should be taken off the market.  It's hard to exercise with all the pain in my limbs during and afterwards.  I have been off of Valsartin for about 3 months and still having problems.",4
Been on diovan at least 15 yrs with no problems.  Started valsartan 3 MO ago. BP has been high and headaches everyday. Excused high BP for anything and everything because diovan always worked with another BP pill for me. All this started shortly after taking generic pills. Thank you for this forum. Going to Dr this a.m. to switch back. How dangerous this could be if valsartan is not the same as diovan. So ridiculous how expensive diovan was before generic came out. Wonder if price went down since generic is available now. ,1
"I have taken Diovan for perhaps 10 years without any side effects. Several months ago, I changed to Valsartan 320-mg because UnitedHealthCare no longer paid for Diovan -- the difference between Diovan and Valsartan is slightly more than $200 per month. Since taken Valsartan, I have tremendous aching in legs and shoulders.",3
"I am having lots of trouble with being dizzy on 180mg, lowered my dose to 80mg and I am still a little dizzy and blood pressure is too low.  ",5
"Humana refused to fill my Diovan 160 mg prescription; said I had to take Valsartan.  Have been on Diovan for 10 years without a problem and my b/p under control.  Now on Valsartan 160 mg have headache, slightly blurry vision, cough, and b/p 157/95.  Maybe this Valsartan is a placebo of some sort because it doesn't seem to bring my b/p down.  Pharma says I have to take the Valsartan a month before allowing the Diovan back.",1
"My doctor switched me from Lisinopril to Valsartan because of continuing orthostatic events (faintness on standing but no fainting). Took Valsartan for 14 months before taking myself off the drug.  Orthostatic events continued on valsartan and worsened. I considered wearing a helmet!  Two or three months after beginning Valsartan I began experiencing ""many"" ectopic beats, PAC's and PVC's. I'd never before experienced PVC's but did not associate with Valsartan - thought I'd strained something exercising. A Polar exercise heart monitor at one point indicated 18.5% ectopic beats immediately after a night's sleep.   Within 3 days of stopping Valsartan, the ectopic beats essentially disappeared. At two months after stopping Valsartan, I can't detect PAC's or PVC's.   Over the last 18 months I've been exercising and lost about 50 lbs - my blood pressure has remained low, typically 100/65. The orthostatic events are getting rare, a few days between events now. On Valsartan(and Lisinopril), if I sat in a chair more than 15 minutes, I planned on being faint after standing.  After two months free of Valsartan, I'm beginning to think the drug was about to kill me. I am, perhaps incorrectly, viewing the arrhythmias as a ticket to sudden heart failure.  I don't recommend that anyone stop the drug without consulting their doctor. My doctor didn't seem concerned about what I was experiencing but I perceived severe quality of life issues. I was NOT suicidal. I monitored BP closely and figured I could start taking the drug again if BP rose excessively; it did not.",1
"I've been on Diovan for 15+ years; the last 8yrs, I've been on 320-12.5mg pill. When Valsartan became available, I can say I saw a huge difference, to the negative, in my numbers. One Diovan 320-12.5mg, my blood pressure was 120/78. On Valsartan 320-12.5mg, my blood pressure is 140/90, consistently. I've talked to my doctor and will begin Edarbyclor 40-25mg. I think the Valsartan is a placebo.  ",1
"Been on this almost one year, blood pressure is sometimes fine, sometimes high. A month ago I got very dizzy and my pressure got low. Ear pressure, head pressure, severe fatigue, brain fog, more hair loss than usual and the list goes on. Went to the doctor, she added another blood pressure med and set me up for a Vestibular test. I almost convinced myself this was Mal de Debarquement from my cruise in June because many of the symptoms match. But after reading the side effects of Valsartan more closely, I'm thinking it is the cause. I'll be stopping it and letting my doctor know. I really hope I start to improve as the more severe symptoms have kept me from driving. I will post another review if my symptoms do not go away after stopping this but I really think this drug is the cause of all these issues. ",3
"I too was on Diovan, and was swtiched to Valsartan. Honestly my BP stays the same.  I've been on Valsartan for over a year, and I only take roughly 85mg.  I am usually within 117/79 even with or without 3 cups a coffee a day.  It does have side affects but so did Diovan.  Somethings you just give up and eat more Ice Cream Instead :)",4
"Like most other reviews I have read, Diovan was working fine until the switch to Valsartan.  My b/p has never been more out of control, 161/100 etc.  I believe Valsartan is just a placebo! I was taking Diovan 160, not Valsartan 320 and have even taken extra when I thought it would help.  B/P doesn't budge!  There should be a class action lawsuit against this drug!",1
"Been taking the generic now since it came out and it isn't lowering my BP at all.  Prior to this had good results with the brand name for at least 10 years 145/75, now I'm lucky if I can get to 154/95.  now trying with doxazosin and diltiazem.",2
"Converted fron Diovan to the generic Valsartan.  It's not lowering my BP at all.  I am taking 160 twice daily.  But it just does not effect my BP.  Sitting in Dr. Office right now.  Waiting for her to see what else we can do, Diovan is much to costly for me, need to make Valsartan work.",1
"This medication is dangerous. The first day, my BP spiked higher and heart rate went into the basement. After that I experienced 24 hour dizziness, severe fatigue, heart pounding, head buzzing, headache and left arm pain. One night recently I fainted and fell on the hard floor giving me a concussion. I have been off this medicine for over a week now but it still feels like it's in my system. I still have some dizziness and occasional heart pounding. This medicine almost cost me my life.",1
"I have taken Diovan for about five years, worked well, kept my BP within the normal range. Insurance switched to Valsartan less than a month ago and my BP is 160s/90s and 100s. I was only taking 80 mg of Diovan once a day. With Valsartan I doubled that when my BP was getting out of hand. My doctor now wants me to go to 320 mg of the Valsartan. I started that yesterday and have not seen a decrease in my BP yet. Just woke up with my heart POUNDING. Dangerous drug especially for someone who does not monitor their BP at home regularly. foot and hand discomfort is new since starting this. Tingling in my left arm and hand like there is no circulation. Headaches every day. Itchy all over but especially hands and feet. Definitely needs to be looked at again by the Feds. This will cost people their lives.",1
"I have taken Diovan for 10 years. My insurance changed it to Valsartan. I have been coughing for two months, lost my voice for a week, my asthma got worse, I am dizzy all the time. this drug is dangerous!!!!",3
After 30 days on meds saw a continued increase in BP (top number) till almost 195) Returned to Diovan brand name and with 3 days numbers were back to 128/72,2
I was switched from Diovan to Valsartan. Since the switch I have noticed two episodes of dizziness after getting up from a sitting position. This has occurred at least five hours after taking. I am concerned that the time release of the medication is defective in some way. The generic manufacturer has had problems in their India manufacturing plant. This unexpected dizziness causing me to stumble is just not ok with me. I never encountered this with Diovan and after a discussion with the pharmacist am switching back. The pharmacist denys knowing of any problems but will report it to the FDA. ,3
"Had been taking Diovan 80mg 2x a day, sometimes 1x a day, control my blood pressure very well for years with no side effects. Pharmacy changed to generic when it became available because of cost. Took it for a couple of weeks was getting sicker by the day. Blood pressure was higher, lower it a little for a few hours, heart rate stayed low regards of what I did, stayed tired dizzy, weak, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg & arms ached, cough, blurred vision, intermittent vertigo. Decided to switch back to brand name of Diovan, started to feel better in a couple of days. Went to see my doctor, finally. I had tried a number of blood pressure meds before nothing worked for me without a lot of side effects until I tried Diovan.  ",1
doesnt make me feel tired.Brings my blood pressure down better than any other medicine I have taken.It is too expensive now since my insurance doesnt want to pay.,3
Diovan 320mg tab 1 daily I had lightheadedness for the first 5 days but then it went away. It was Great but costly. I had to change because of the high cost $470.00 with insurance. Replcement Med cost $18.00 and I feel Great!.,4

I take 80 mg twice per day and this drug has in combination with others has greatly reduced my BP.,5
"WEAKNESS IN LEGS, TINGLING, COLD FEET, SWELLING OF FEET AND CALVES.",5
migraine headache,2
Does not have alot of side affects. Very little.,4
A generak weakness-feelings of weakness from the hips down-shortness of breath and all activities lead to an overwhelming feeling of weakness and discomfort.,2
"50 mg for 9 weeks. Within 2 days extreme fatigue, could not run up stairs anymore or exeercise,intermitent headaches. Effective to lower blood pressure but later fits of cough, difficulty breathing, left chest and shoulder pains, racing heartbeat, constant headache, face swelling, total loss of smell and ability to taste food, fullness in the ears causing slightly reduced hearing and occasional loud tinnitus, slightly blurry vision, shaking hands, night sweating, constant anxiety. All problems increasing in intensity. Stopped the medication. Everything back to normal within 3 days. Was then put on Norvasc. See review on 4/3/09.",1
"Have been on Diovan HCT for over 5 years with no side effects. Had previously used Lisinopril with a resulting nagging cough that kept my wife and myself up all night. I see there were a few complaints about too low BP on this drug, but with high dosages. You should tell your Dr about this and try a lower dose. I am a 49 year old male 6'2"" 275 lb and only take an 80/12.5 dose.",5
Must be taken every morning. Suggest a dated container to keep record for each day.,4
Great treatment option for the vast majority of people.  Less side effects than an ace. Very affordable and more research behind this drug then most others on the market.  I would recommend this to anyone with hypertension,5
Have used ths medication for 2 years 1 80mg pill each morning and my BP is consistantly at 110/75 -- vs 150/95 without BP treatment -- previous use of Ace Blocker was less stable redings,5
This medication lowered my BP to 106/64 within 1 week of starting it at 160 mg. I was weak and unable to perform my normal walking and Jazzercise activities and I am now trying Benicar 10 mg. I had previously switched from Benazapril 10 mg which actually worked better for me but caused a severe cough.  I'm hoping Benicar is the answer.  I was not happy with the majority of comments on Benicar but there were a few very happy users so I'm hopeful.,3
I have H.B. preshure but not as high until I started using this new med Valsartan. yes I had a spike of 160/94 - 47 after missing a dose (one a day of 160 mg).,2
seems to keep blood pressure down if I wacth what I eat,3
"Diovan has been prescribed for me in increasing doses. My b/p has not decreased and I have been experiencing increased joint pain in my knees and elbows.I take it before I go to bed. I am a 5'7"" 74 year old  no weight problems (124lbs.) very active. ",1
This drug has been recalled.,1
"Mucus in throat, wet cough, did not have this problem with Diovan Hct. Will contact my Dr. because she did not approve the generic but the insurance company requested I try it. Don't like this feeling in my throat. ",1
The diuretic adds a few more trips to the bathroom per day.  That inconvenience is more than offset by the consistently good blood pressure control (115-110 over 80-70) each measurement) I'm getting.  Absolutely no side effects.,5
"NO side effects at all, had bad heart palpitations on Lisinopril so they switched me to Valsartan. No issues since.",5
"This wasn't the first drug they tried me out on, but it was the first one that worked well and didn't give me any side effects. I have an extensive family history of hypertension, and so far this drug has been wonderful for controlling mine.",5
"Had very high b/p and needed to take meds. Worked closely with dr. until we figured out what was effective. That's the secret! Been on 80-12.5 plus metoproplol/tart50mg. and have gotten it under control. Take control of your health people! Do some homework! If you need to, get a new dr.!",5
High pitch ringing in my ears also light headed and constant pressure feeling in my ears.,2
"I usually take my BP medication right before I go to bed, but this generic version of Diovan causes my mouth to go so dry that my tongue feels swollen and my mouth so cotton dry I can't sleep.  I have irregular heart beats and palpation's, I can't take it anymore, it is awful. ",2
"I use the valsatan-HTZ80/12.5. watch the manufacturer. cigina switched, was feeling honorably for two months. realized what is was. I had to find somewhere hoe had the right manufacturer.    ",4
"Switched from 160 mg of Diovan to generic Valsartan, same dosage.  Within a couple of weeks, bp spikes increased and was sick with nausea for over a week. My doctor switched me back to the brand name and the nausea stopped and bp leveled out.  Valsartan does not work for me.  I'm paying an extra $500 a year for the brand name but I'm lucky that I have that option.",1
"Heart palpations, extreme weakness ",1
"Insurance switched me from Diovan to Valsartan, I experienced heart palpatations, headaches, hearing my heartbeat in my ears, and dizziness.",1
"Unfortunately, I did not discover the switch from Diovan to this generic for quite some time; during which I have suffered from erratic and very high bp, not to mention other symptoms such as nausea, stiff joints, muscle pains, fatigue, etc. This generic drug has caused me enormous grief, physically and emotionally! I am trying to get back on Diovan asap!  ",2
My blood pressure has gone way up.  I didn't realize my pharmacy switched this until I went to doc with coughing and chest issues.  I have also noticed dizziness and nausea.  Switching back.  You can get a card for $4 through Diovan.  Do not take these meds,1
"I have been having coughs about 3 to 4 times a day sometimes about 3 4 hours apart, cough two/three times then ok.  Is coughing associated with Valsartan??",5
"I have decreased urination,itching a lot, drymouth. I asked the dr to change the medication, but she says you are doing fine on it.  I drink a lot of fluids counting milk, water and tea (one cup).  At times, ihave palpitations and have taken 250mg. Of magnesium.  Blood work showed low onmagnesium.  Going to have it checked agai .  One GP Dr told me not to drink a lot of water when my   Ankles were swollen",4
Don't know why my legs twitch.,3
"I had to change from DiovanHCT TO GENERIC valsartan HTC as my insurance refused to pay for Diovan. GENERIC caused BP 15 points higher, water retention, migraines increased from once a month to almost everyday. Report to FDA!",1
It has kept my blood pressure down to normal range.  No problems with it at all.  Am satisfied with the product.,5
"Since the drug co. switched from Diovan to Valsartan, my BP has been about 10 points higher in general.  One thing I've noticed is that my fingernails are splitting and peeling.  Has anyone else had this problem?",2
"Experienced severe irregular heartbeat, chest pain and stomach discomfort.Was taking Diovan with no problems. My drug insurance company switched my prescription from Diovan to the generic Valsartan. Stopped taking Valsartan and all symptons ceased within 3 days. Returned to taking Diovan with no problems. ",3
I took Diovan for years with no problem. My insurance changed me to generic. Have had daily nausea and at first couldn't figure out the cause.I stopped on my own after 3 months of taking it because I almost passed out from the dizziness and nausea.I'll look for another med that works. This has been hell. ,4
"First day of taking I got a very bad stomach ache, second day was even worst could not get out of bed. I hated it. But my Insurance won't pay for the brand anymore. This is a shame since it doesn't even control my pressure.      ",2
"within days of taking this drug, I developed severe case of hives, popping out ever where, very tired, and upsett stomach",2
"Within the first month of taking this generic medication I have swollen itchy hands, sore throat and developed a cough.  I would not recommend anyone switching to this generic med.  I am planning to return to Diovan HCT.  I do not believe this is the same med as Diovan and think a review of this drug should be done.",2
My doctor switched me to this Generic of Diovan and within 2 days I had numbness and tingling fingers and swollen fingers and ankles.  It doesn't work either for high blood pressure.  Mine was higher than on other meds. ,1
I get very random bouts of an irregular heartbeat,3

"My insurance insisted on generic of diovan, I have been taking it for about 2 months. I began having pain in my mouth, sores on my lips, inside of cheeks swollen, and even hurting on my tongue. Finally tried to think of what I had done different and remembered beginning generic diovan about time my problems started. Stopped taking it and have had relief within a day. I have suffered so much with this, when I talked to pharmacist she said it's the same ingredients as Diovan, can't be, it's twice the size. What else is in this medicine? Wish I had read these reviews 2 months agao, I've been treated for sinus infection, sore throats, TMJ, and been to dentist twice. No one has been able to figure out what's wrong. ",4
"My doctor did not prescribe this drug. The pharmacy changed over from Diovan HTC.  This drug did not help at all. It's like something you'd shove down a cow's throat, it's twice as big. Also three of the major insurance companies don't even have it listed in their formularies.",1
i have been taking the generic of diovan for at least 2 mos now and i feel that it is not as effective because with the diovan i would go to the bathroom more and with this one i dont. Why is the pill much bigger then the diovan if it is exactly the same why difference in size. ,2
Pill is twice the size of comparable dosage of diovan. Whats with all the filler? This is what is causing side effects,2

After all those years I started getting a bed swelling and gradually wounds of my lips.Eight doctors including a lip biopsy coud not find the reason for it.On my own, I stopped the Valsartan and the condition cleared after long months of suffering. I started to take it again and now two years later I received the bad symptoms again. I will stop it now, and see that my doctor  will give me another BP medicine.",4

"Blood pressure was consistently 200 over 160. Doc prescribed Exforge -- which lowered BP by 20. Switched to generic Amlodipine/Valsartan HCTZ (with diuretic). BP has consistently been 120 over 80 or lower for the past four years. This med was a life saver. My father died of a heart attack in his early 60's, my brother died of a heart attack in his early 60s. Genetics aside, this med has worked exceptionally well for me.",5

Weight gain, hair loss.  numbness and tingling of the hands, face and lower extremities. Terrible sinus issues. I was taking it for migraines.  Chronic insomnia and then central sleep apnea - cause unknown. I believe that it is caused by this medication. The longer I took it the more symptoms appeared.  2008 to 2014",1
"I am not taking enough yet, but it helps with my depression and small heart palpitations",5
"This medication did help cut down my migraines, but it caused a horrible mood type disorder.  I was pissed off and angry all of the time, everything set me off (and I'm normally an easy going person.)  I took the meds for a month and finally thought the mood issue may be related to this medication so I stopped it and the very next morning my normal easy going mood was back.",2
my heart rate runs from 35 to well over 100 bpm  I only take Verapamil when I have high heart rate. It is one of the few medications that I do not have an allergic reaction to.,5
"I have had severe cluster headaches since about the time I turned 21. First and second major bouts were dealt with swiftly with the administration of moderate doses of Prednisone. My second most recent bout (2015), didn't respond to major doses of Prednisone and my neurologist decided to give Verapamil a try. It has kept my headaches at bay, taking 80mg 3x/day, but recently I have begun another sever bout. Upping the dose to 120 3x/day at first decreased the severity of pain from the headaches from an average of 8/10 to a 4/10. Over the last few days, I have been cluster free, just from upping the dose for a week. I think this drug is amazing. Also, shots of Sumatriptan are the only other way I've found relief, but I'd rather take a preventative drug than a responsive one.",4

I have been on 240MG of this medication since 1996 when I was diagnosed with 2 Cerebral Aneurysms. It was prescribed for High Blood Pressure and to prevent a Stroke. My blood Pressure has been fine and no strokes in all these (BLESSED) years. I again was diagnosed with 1 Cerebral Aneurysm in 2007.I continue to take this medication and I am great!,5
"I was having 3 migraines a week.  After taking verapamil, i am down to 1 migraine in two weeks!!!  I have had slight dizziness but i am am to function!!",5
"Have been on 480mg of varapamil daily for over 2 years now. My headache is continual, and has been with me for 3 1/3 years now. Verapamil has helped to lessen the pain for me by about 2 to 3 degrees on the pain scale. I have had minimul side affects, the constapation is something i was able to control with my diet. (fruits / vegs).   Everytime I get my blood preasure taken it's in the 'perfect' range.  For me, verapamil is part of a daily dose of meds. The days, i miss taking my varapamil are HORRIBLE.",3
"Over the many years that I've been on this medication I've been switched from the lower dose, years later to two times a day back to one time a day on 240 mg and now for the past year or so to 300 mg at bed time.  It has always made my hair shed but not noticeable loss,(only to me), and the 300 mg has my body aching like fibromyalgia in the legs, thighs and other parts of the body. My blood pressure has not been normal on the 300 mg. Just side effects of pain.  ",2
"I was placed on 120 mg Verapamil once a day in April of 2007. For going on 8 years on the same dosage my BP remained at safe levels. I had minimal side effects and can only report excessive sweating out and in doors an issue not present before taking this Medication. I have experienced mild constipation which I remedy with yogurt Activia with live cultures, and I eat plenty of fruit.I also have an increase in blurred vision. the last issue is sudden chills. All of these side effects are worth dealing with as long as my BP is controlled.The 20 th of Feb. my dosage needed to be increased to 120 mg x2 a day as my BP was no longer controlled by the 120mg x 1 a day.I expect to not have additional issues arise on 240 mg per day, if it happens my Physician appreciates patient input always, and will adjust or change if it becomes necessary.",5
"Was taking 240 mg of this.  It worked well in lowering my HBP to 110/79 most of the time.  This was good however, I hated taking this pill.  I was extremely constipated, had headaches, lost of hair in large amounts, instantly felt like I was burning up,  constantly wanted to urinate even it just a few drops and I was VERY RED in the face all the time on this drug and at times I sweat like a hog and felt flushed and faint.  I even had my cardio doctor work with me and had him break my pill down in to 80 mgs three times a day.  Couldn't get this right but this was to counteract the VERY RED face, I mean I thought I would pop I was so red and people would stare at me.  Finally got off of this drug and am happy to say I am not having any of these effects any longer.  However, I did have diabetes II and was able to get over it while I was on this drug.  However, I didn't have it long or very bad I thought because I changed my eating habits and stopped sugars and starches and had my A1C back in normal range and has been ever since.  So now I don't know if it was a side effect of a drug I hated that had lots of side effects on me or my better eating habits.  I have to say at times this Verapamil was so good at lowering my high blood pressure that at times it dropped me very fast to 110/60.  ",5
"The drug along with nortriptyline  that I have been taking for years is a added boost, I have migraines less often but my friends and family have noticed I lose my temper easily and lash out at them so I may stop taking it for a bit to see if that behavior stops. ",3
"I don't know if this is a side effect but sometimes when I take a deep breath feel funny like not enough air then goes away have felt this way since on medicine dr says he does not think its causing it and cant give me a reason I feel this way,thinking about seeing another dr. need answers",4
I now have lupus of the skin.,3
My headaches have worsened and become more frequent in the 3 weeks since I began taking Verapamil 120mg/day. I have never had problems with anxiety or with sleeping however I am suffering with anxiety and insomnia terribly. I feel like I live in a constant state of caffiene jitters with this drug(and I rarely have caffeine)... I can't wait for this to leave my system!!!,1

"I have been dealing with anxiety the past year with neck pain mgmt. proceedures.  Went to ER one night with anxiety attack which lead to Tachycardia.  Had the whole cardiac workup, heart is fine.  Was put on Metoprolol which worked but wanted to try other meds. for BP and heart rate due to wanting to get allergy shots (which you can not due on BetaBlockers), tried two channel blockers over the course of two weeks, one of which was Verapamil Er 120 at bedtime.  This med brought my blood pressure up and heart rate up, palpitations worse with the first night I took it.  My blood pressure on Losartan and Metoprolol kept it under 130/80, so I am seeing Cardiologist tommorrow to get back on Metoprolol and just deal with my allergies another way.  Hopefully doing this and started a low dose antidepressant will get me felling better again.",1
The Statin drug interred with the Verapamil and I had a heart attack.,5
It took a while to get this medication along with a second one to get my cluster headaches under control.  I use this (180 mg) along with Deprakote (1500 mg.)  I went from 120 mg to 180 mg and within a few days my cluster of headaches which I had been have for many months disappeared.,4
NO problems. Works extremely well. Very happy with it!,5

"I been taking (calan) verapamil since 1988 for high blood pressure.  I am now taking 240 mg verapamil and 25 mg of losartan potassium to control bp.  My pulse in the morning drops to high 50's. br is usually around 125/70.  I watch my salt content and avoid caffeine.  I was taking diovan but asked the doctor to switch me to losartan because of cost.  I also take  hydrochlorothiazid, tamsulosin,warfarin, avodart, and simvastatin. About 7 years ago I switched doctors and he took me off of verapamil.  5 days later I had A-fib. Chemical shock did not work. The cardiologist put me back on verapamil.  In 3 days my A_fib was gone.  He then increased my dosage to 240 mg twice a day. Moved to Florida.  New doctor.  Talked doctor into my stop taking warfarin since I had no record of a-fib for 5 years. Changed bp medicaation to one 240 mg of verapamil a day and diovan.  A year later I had a-fig for one day.  I am now back on warfarin.  Talked the doctor in changing diovan to losartan.  Saves me approx $1000 a year.  I do go to the bathroom a lot. I have had radiation treatment for prostate cancerand do have an enlarged prostste.  I am slightly concerned about the interaction between verapamil and simvastatin.  I am 81 and still play golf 3-4 time a week.  I will stay with verapamil.   ",4

Out of the 45 migraines I have had in 3 months my migraine medicine has only work twice. I have been on zomig, relpax, imitrix. I have been using lortabs to control the pain and be able to function somewhat for work and taking care of my kids. I am on 180 mg daily but am having side effects, itching skins, swelling, constipation,  red neck, loss of appetite. Have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks going to ask to be taken off of this med. I have heard Topamaz works better for complex migraines so maybe we can try that. The ER doctor gave me valium to take daily which worked amazing and I didn't have a migraine for 4 days but my doctor (Family Doctor) won't prescribe it to me....not sure why it helped my head.

Recently I have had dizziness and fainting( I also have Meniere's disease and could not tell the difference in that or the PVC's)  so my Primary Phy sent me to a specialist in the electrical functions of the heart.  He is trying me on this regime even tho I do not have high blood pressure.  He is fairly confident that this may work.  My condition is benign, but annoying and interfering with my life.

Another benefit- it has lowered my BP, which began to rise 3 months ago. Only been on this drug 8wks total. THANKS to these reviews, I will now talk to Dr about changing.

"Before I was officially diagnosed with Chronic Tension Migraines, my mother put me on Verapamil. It worked WONDERS for me, but the only problem was, since I was so young, it lowered my heart rate to the 60's, and I couldn't really exercise. But as far as preventing migraines, it was a success! I had to stop treatment because I needed to go up on the dose, but my body wouldn't have allowed it.",5
No problems,5
I have been on this drug for 20 years. started on 120mg 2times a day now on 240mg 3 per day it works great and have no side effects.,4
"I was diagnosed with pre-hypertension in 2008. My Dr. put me on 120mg Verapamil, and I was doing ok for 2 years. Then she decided she wanted it even lower than 120/78, and I was given 180mg, and my world turned upside down. I had to have my nose cauterized from all the nose bleeds. I think I hit every side effect, except for the constipation. There was the daily dizzines,feeling like my lungs were drowning, and the twinges in my chest, along with taste and smell issues. To top it all off, my B/P was now uncontrolled, and all over the place. There were many times I felt like going to the ER. Be very carefull with this medicine, and let your Dr. know immediately about any side effects. This B/P medicine is suppose to help...not do more damage. ",1
"it works, level's out my blood pressure from being too high or too low",5
"I was given this medicine three years ago, but at a lower dose. As soon as my Dr. changed the dose to 180mg, I started to have severe dizziness, even while sitting. Face would flush throughout the day, with sharp head pain, very low energy, and throwing up/nausea.Urine was always dark. I am now off all of it, and I feel so much better. Bp is normal. So much more energy, and I lost eigt pounds.",2
While taking this drug I ended up in the emergency room with elevated blood pressure when my doctor increased my dose to 360 from 180.  I also has a terrible allergic reaction when my face swelled up and began to itch.  This lasted two weeks until my doctor lowered the dose back to 180.  My hair began to fall out and I lost about one third of my hair.  This is a terrible drug and should be taken off the market. ,1
I am thrilled with the med. It helped to lower BP and I am now like 127/70. But the constipation is AWFUL. Have had to see another doctor because of the intense constipation. Side Effect is terrible and at this point painful.,5
My Dr has taken me off verapamil Er cap 120 mg daily. I also take Diovan 320 mg. She thinks the verapamil was the cause of Ischemic Colitis and a hospital stay. My B/P is uncontrolled. Does anyone know of this side effect caused by this drug?,4
"I have only taken this medication for 12 days now.  I am taking it for tachycardia.  Which my heartrate was 100-140 for a few months.  After taking this it stays about 100-110.

It took about 2 weeks for the drug to really begin to work, but I have not had any major headaches causing vertigo since about the 2 week mark. I can drive again! I do find that I get a bit of shortness of breath around the time that I need to take my dosage, so it is important to take this drug when needed and not skip any doses. I also have issues with my BP, and I find that this drug seems to be maintaining it at a good level. So far, so good.",4
"I had 2 types of headaches. A very intense morning full forehead ache which the Verapamil is preventing.  The other is a during the day right side of head headache ache much less intense, it doesn't help at all with those.",4

"rash, itching and tiredness",5
Tried a 240 mg tablet but it did not do much good.  Tried 450 mg (max dose) and it helped some but side effect of constipation became severe.  If you need to take much of this medicine buy stock in prune juice factory as you will become its best customer.,3

I had filled a prescription of Verapamil yesterday, and the side effects noted on the fact sheet indicated that this drug could cause congestive heart failure.  I would like to know is this true, because I get shortness of breath sometimes that I have to breathe very quickly because it feels as thou my heart stopped beating.  I would like to know should I discontinue use of this drug for these reasons, and for the excessive amount of weight I have gained since starting treatment.",4

Had terrible coughing.Went back to Verapimil which now doesn't control BP at all and constipation is much worse. Dr. will start me on a new drug next week. Anything would be better than this one. Evidently not for long term use. Was using 240mg.",2

"I have tried other bp meds and had major chest pains and itching, dry coughs, but with verapamil 80 I do not experience these type of side effects. However, I do experience constipation, and slight swelling, and when I miss a dose I experience shortness of breath and am very tired. I also experienced itching when taking more than 80 mg and I am not sure but I feel like it may also be damaging my kidneys as well my urine is usually darker and has a bad odor at times. I also believe it may be causing my hair to fall out more than usual. But I like it better than Lisinopril which caused me severe chest pains and heart attack like conditions. Although Verapamil has lowered my bp reading from 170/120 to about 149/100 the doctors are not satisfied with these results. They want it to be in the range of 120/80. Recently my new doctor has prescribed me new meds but I am not sure to switch considering new side effects. I will keep all posted. We are all in this together. ",3

In fact I now get them daily,(could be this drug or other medical cond. but with the other bad side effects it's probably the cause of worsening & more frequent headaches/cluster/migraines. sometimes 2 in a day (take Rx that helps but not entirely).  It has caused many adverse side effects including; Extreme, severe constipation (even with stool softeners have had only 3 difficult, & hard bowel movements in this time, Pains in stomach like a hot rock right after taking it, lasting several hours. anxiety attacks, shakiness, arm pain, worsening of leg & feet swelling, fast & sometimes hard heart beats, more short of breath, may be causing higher than usual blood sugar levels, night time trips to bathroom to urinate (not normal), urine is often darker than normal. I certainly don't want to take a drug that often causes weight gain either. Don't take this drug. I wasn't informed about all of the probable side effects. Had to come to this site to find info & reviews. The constipation is serious & health threatening. Yes, I drink a lot of water, but wasn't warned about this or most other side effects.  So along with the other side effects I'm stopping this drug now. ",1

The capsule is really big and hard to swallow at times.  I don't think it has made any difference in my migraines, but since then, I have developed high blood pressure, so they've kept me on this and prescribed Lisinopril 10 mg.  They both take care of my bp, but I would like to quit taking the Verapamil if possible. I've had no noticeable side effects from either of these drugs.",1
this drug is great for migrains.,5
I was px verapamil 240mg daily for prevention of migranes & cluster headaches. After 16 days on this med the side effects i experienced outweighed any relief. The side effects are: bright red face with intense heat/feet swollen feet/swollen legs & fingers from fluid retension/ insane constipation/bowel issues/ joint pain in hands & feet/ 2 explosive migranes /racing heart beat/pulse...kept thinking that these would go away after body adjusted to med but can't live like this...,1
"I am taking for resistant high blood pressure. Also take pindolol 10mg 3x daily, 75 mg Hydralizine 3x daily. Have taken propranolol also. Verapimil is very effective and very fast at lowering BP, but there are very irritating side effects. Very bad constipation and when it wears can give rebound diarrhea, especially when taking prunes. Have had to change exercise regimen to find a bathroom, hidden bushes or exercise at night. Lowers heart rate much more than propranolol, but also much faster  propranolol, BP down in 30 minutes.

Life has been so much better since I was prescribed this drug.  I now rarely get migraines and never to the extent they once were.  When I get them I can now get rid of them by taking Imitrex or Trexmet which never worked in the past.",5
"Have been on this medication for over a year with minimal results. Some days my BP is lower but most days it is not. Side effects I have had are, being light headed, dizzy, tired, and sleepy.

I also had poor instruction when I started taking it, and was taking the entire 360 mg dose once a day.

Had no expectations starting this but within two weeks I could sleep through the night, I felt less anxious and my blood pressure is finally perfect 9 out 10 readings.  I have no idea why one calcium channel blocker worked better than the other or if it's going to last but I hope so.  Unfortunately when I switched my Raynaud's came back a little (which is why they were determined to keep me on Nifedipine) but it has been very minor (also it's summer when it usually goes away) and it's a good trade off to the way I was feeling.  I do occasionally feel a bit light headed, tired and spaced but overall so much better and my tiredness is more a normal tired than that anxious-tired from before.  I don't think any bp medication is without side effects, but it's definitely worth checking out other options.",3

"I use this in combo with lisinopril.  Keeps my blood pressure in the 120/75 range most of the time.  I used to have headaches, and they went away completely.  I too can drink a beer again without a headache",4
"I took 80mg once a day and it stopped my migraines from recurring.  Unfortunately, it also dropped by blood pressure and pulse rate so far that I felt miserable and could barely function.  So I had to stop taking it.",4
"I've been on Verapamil 80 mg. (twice a day) for one week, as well as Triamterne HCTZ. I have not noticed any changes in my blood pressure - 180/110 this morning. How long does it take before this drug kicks in? Also, I feel like I'm about to faint at any given time of the day. I'm planning to go to the cardiologist, but I don't want a medicine that'll make me gain weight which is counterproductive to my overall goal - to get my bp down, weight down and exercise more.",2
This medicine has made me light headed.  I'm always tired.  I have even fainted once.  ,4
This drug has reduced my blood pressure to where it is almost normal in a short period of time HOWEVER I pee 3-4 times per night and that is getting a little old.I may ask for something different that does not have this side effect if that exists.,3
heart fluttering,5
I have taken Verapamil SR 120mg once a day for 10 yrs. to slow my heartbeat down and help my heart to relax and pump more efficient. I notice that when I don't take it my chest will hurt. So taking it everyday is very important.  ,5
I have been taking 120 mg twice daily for about 3 months now and my migraines are less intense and I have only had maybe 4 headaches total so far. I use to get about 2 - 3 headaches a week. I love this medication!!! ,5
"After having a cluster headache episode for 3 and 1/2 months my doctor put me on verapmil. And less than 2 weeks later not only were my headaches gone, but I was able to have a real beer and or a glass of wine.",5
this drug is great my heart rate has reduced alot nd I feel so much better.,5
I found you can not take vitamin D in any form with this. It has caused a hesitant conditon in my pulse rate. The pulse beats alright for some beats then stops a second and starts again. My doctor said she had heard of vitamin D interfering but I was the first she had seen with this condition. ,3
Great,5
"The Doc prescribed Verapamil after 2 weeks of severe cluster headaches, following a 10 day dosage of Prednisone.  The first dosage of Verapamil 120mg did not kick the headaches, so he doubled the dose to 240mg.  The headaches eased to a tolerable state at that dosage until they went away fully after about a month.  The doc then kept me on Verapamil indefinitely for the headaches and high blood pressure. Be prepared to wake up 3 or 4 times a night to urinate while on this medication. I've also experienced the dizziness and tiredness at times, but not every day like with the urinating.  So far I am impressed with Verapamil.",4
"Have been taking for 3 weeks now.  Since taking 40mg a day for background headaches and migraine prevention, I have noticed a remarkable improvement in how many daily headaches - maybe 1 a week vs. 1-2 a day.  My gums are very sensitive, no bleeding, but feel tingly often.  Other than that, this has made my life so much better.  ",4
I do have the constipation but I am using benefiber and that helps.  I also urinate a lot more than before but I guess that is a good thing.  I like this drug very much.,5
have taken 120mg for 4 months it lowered my bp so low i couldnt funtion also lowered my pulse to the low 40's also ended up with fluid build up on my lungs from this medicine and now on felodipine 5 mg take at night seems to be working bp is normal now so is pulse rate. but still have some fluid  on lungs hope to clear that up soon be careful on this med you can easy over dose with it so always inform doctor of low bp and pulse rate,1
there is the night urinating. i found if you eat an unusual salty meal you will eliminate water all night. no complaints. have managed my high blood pressure with this drug.,5
"Good Lord, what a RELIEF! I have had cluster headaches for 18 years, and only now have been able to break the cycle with verapamil and a ""kick off"" dose of prednisone. No more triptans..ya hoo! I do not take verapamil all the time, just when a cluster session comes, which for me is every 9-16 months for 4 weeks at a time.",5
"I've been taking verapamil for a week now and so far have only minor ""background"" headaches, after almost three weeks of migraines/cluster headaches.  Have tried several treatments for prevention - couldn't tolerate Topamax, and propranalol didn't do anything but make me dizzy.  Rescue meds like Imitrex and Zomig have helped a little, but my best rescue combo is Relpax and Excedrin with ice packs front and back. ",4
My 12 year old daughter has been on this for only 1 week. For a severe migraine/rebound headache that has lasted 6 weeks. So far some improvement but some dizziness and she is lightheaded.,2
"I am worried about this medication because I also take propanlolol and I think this interferes with it, but my doctor says not toworry. I take 40mg a day of propanlolol.",2
I have noticed a big difference w/my headaches and racing heart. But causes constipation problems,4
I have taken this drug for approximatly 16 years for paroxismal atrial tachicardia. It is the only drug which stopped my heart rates up to 220 beats per minute. Although I wonder what the long term effects of this drug is after so many years of use.,5
"It has wiped me out and i get all kinds of body aches, it has been 3 weeks and my life is not normal, I am all but drooling on just 120 mg 1 per day ",4
My Dr. prescribed verapamil and Imitrex for my cluster headaches.  My headaches were so bad I used to sleep on the bathroom floor because it was quiet and dark.  After treatment I have not had another episode for almost 3 years.,5
Verapamil has kept tachycardia under control for about 20 years.,5
I have gone from one three-day migraine per month to infrequent episodes. This has been great for me.,5
My blood pressure was very high and my dr had to keep increasing the dose of Verapamil to lower it. Im on 360 mg now and its still not where it should be. ,2
"It took a little while for my body to adjust to it, but I have been on it for 4 years and my bp is great, also no noticeable side effects.",5
I HAVE ONLY BEEN ON VERAPAMIL FOR 2 MONTHS.MY LEGS HAVE BEEN SWELLING.I WAS WONDERING IF VERAPAMIL HAS CAUSE THIS?,2

"Started this drug over 10+ years ago. Started out with 10mg. Now have moved up to 30mg.and have a terrible uncontrollable cough, this is the only side effect that I have ever had from this medicine over all these years. But I think it must be time for an ACE inhibitor type BP med. can not live with this cough.",4
"This medication helped my condition, but after taking this drug for 15 years with no problem, I had an allergic reaction. My upper lip swelled and I broke out in hives. Because my lip was swelling, my doctor told me to go to the ER. An IV drip of steroids and antihistamines was administered, and I had to take steroid pills for 10 days. ",5
"Found out my blood pressure was high in Easter of 2013.. I tried eating right(vegetarian diet) and exercise, it worked. I got too comfortable and started eating egg, cheese and fish again. In the last two weeks I've had lots coconuts, the water and jelly hard and soft meat (Caribbean people knows what I'm talking about :)) maybe too much good cholesterol and I ate out and something in the food raised my bp . For two weeks I felt like I would pass out. I went to the Doctor, my bp readings 175/95, 130/100 he recommend Zestril. Been taking it for two days.. mercy - sinking feeling, light feeling, tickling of throat, headache, vertigo feeling when rising. Today I tried calling doctor, was unsuccessful, my readings are 110/77, 90/84. I want to know if I should stop taking it.",3
Started with low dose of Zestril in 1988 (age 48) for HBP; 25 mg I think. As I aged the dosage increased was until 1998 when I was moved to another drug.  I did not have any of the listed side effects. Currently using 100 mg Metoprolol with too many side effects.  Looking for a substitute.,4
I have never had effects of high blood pressure.  I do have trouble getting 5 mg tablets from my pharmacy My dosage is 15 mg per day.,5
"at first it worked good, but recently it is not working as it should. i am getting headaches, shortness of breath and pians in both of my shoulders.",3
I may be taking a higher mg than need be for I have felt a sinking feeling a few times. Can anyone let me know if I can half the pill and receive 1/2 the dosage to prevent this.  ,3
Just some vertigo when waking in morning. No other side effects,4

It's is very good medication for me. ,5
no side effects at all,5
"Have had the dry, hacking, annoying cough since I started it!  Am now sleep deprived, irritable and tired of coughing 24/7!  Will be ever so grateful to have my MD switch my med to something better!",2
"Been on Lisinopril 2.5 mg for over a year and Corgard 20 mg twice daily and does the job,but lately after taking the Lisinpril I get a terrible headache and wondering if this is the cause even with being on so long.Anyone have or experinced this problem?Thanks.",4
"I took this medicine because I had protein in my urine. I am a type 1 diabetic. It caused pancytopenia in me, meaning that all my blood cell levels were low and they thought I needed a bone marrow transplant. After nearly a year off the meds my blood levels returned to normal. I am not telling anyone not to take this medicine, but if you do please make your doctor run a CBC test a couple times a year to make sure your blood levels are normal. I was told that my reaction to this medicine was 1:1,000,000, but I don't want anyone else to be the one in a million too!",2
i am 26 and i have been having high blood pressure for a few months dr put me on this almost a week ago i have had no side effects,3

Any advice on what time of day I should take this medication? I do like my beer at night and work during the day. Just got the script forgot to ask the doctor.,1
"nausea, dizziness",2
I am a 50 year old male and recently was told I had high blood pressure 190/100. They put me on hydrochlorot and that didn't work so they added zestril. I take 20 mg. The drug has worked wonders in lowering my blood pressure 124/79 or there abouts. The only draw back is the dry hacking caugh. It is worse when I go to bed. In fact I have to get up and sleep on the cough because it keeps the wife awake. I called the doctor today to see it she could put me on a non ACE Inhibitor blood pressure drug as that is the reason for the caugh.,5
Would like to know if I can stop taking this med at some point in time once my BP is stable?,5
Keep an eye on your Potassium level.,5
"dry hacky cough, low sex drive",4
I'm a 44 Year Old Man. My BP had been 156/95 for about six months or more. After 1 week my BP is 118/75. No cough or other side effects except some irritabilty. I'm taking 10 mg with a diuretic. ,5
I have had hypertension for 14 years. I teach elementary school(many stressors)and this drug has been a Godsend.  The only down side is the dry hacking cough.  Sometimes it occurs at night.  Remember to take this medication at the same time everyday. I take it at 6:00AM works wonders for the rest of the day.,5
"My cardiologist put me on this, took it for about a week and now I feel great!",5
"I am taking Zestril 5mg. to protect my kidneys from diabetes. I am dizzy most of the time, nauseous most of the time, and a dry hacking cough that causes me to start choking. I keep hard candy near me all the time and water. I hope I won't have to take this medicine much longer...",4
"dry hacking cough,no info given advising of this side effect",3
"My doctor put me on this medication one week ago. I have been having attacks of sweating, but my skin is cold and clamy, and I feel nauseas, but only have the fry heaves",5

high blood pressure,5
"Have been on this med for 12 yrs. with no problems.  Switched to Lisinopril because it was cheaper by far. (My Zestril had gone up, and Insurance cut back).  I will be going back to Zestril immediately.  I feel lousy on Lisinopril.  Have been on it 2 weeks, am light headed, spacey, not focused, have unusual knee pain, feel sleepy.  I actually got a speeding ticket!  Haven't had one for 40 yrs.!  Just wasn't focused on my driving....that's dangerous.  I'm going back to Zestril...pronto! So far, my blood pressure is not as low on Lisinopril as it was on Zestril. Zestril does a better job for me.",5
"I have been on bp meds for 12 years, this medication works for me, no side effects either!",5
Caused a bad dry cough,2
my sodium is flucuating,4
"Just a warning on a side effect. This drug can cause swelling, usually lips but can be severe enough to stop the breathing.  The swelling caused 2 ER visits for my spouse before a nurse recognized the reaction was to the drug.  This happened after 10+ years on the drug and the episodes were almost a year apart so not easy to diagnose as a reaction to the drug.  There is lots of literature on this if you search.",4
I have had no side effects with this medication. It is very effective if you take it correctly. ,5
Blood pressure fell considerably within 12 hours,1
I have a very slow heart beat and so this was the only drug that worked on my HBP without slowing my heart down to where I couldn't even walk.  So I have recently recommended it to a friend that was having trouble with her medication.  But I am glad that I read these reviews so I can warn her if she starts having any of the side effects I read about here.  ,5
"My headache I get from this stuff is constant and pretty severe. It is difficult for me to concentrate on anything. The dry cough is also annoying. It has lowered my blodd pressure, but not significantly only about 10 points. I don't care how well it works, it is debilitating and keeping me from living my life. ZESTRIL SUCKS.",4
I don't like taking medicine but finding out I had to lower my blood pressure I was happy to not have much of a side effect taking this one.Highly recommended my blood pressure is normal again nad its been a week when I started taking the medicine.,5
"Best drug in the world.  From end stage total heart failure caused by malignant hypertension BP 240/160 to perfect control and good health 11 years later.  The cough goes away in a month.  Stick w. it, it mixes well w. all other drugs and you can still drink heavily once a week w/out problems.  If you get postural hypotension and dizzy spells taking this w. other drugs quit the other drugs first.",5
"Gave me headaches,got cough and cold symtems.Eyes turn red.",3
I been geting a dry chough from this drug.,5
The medication was successful within a matter of days in bringing my blood pressure down to even slightly below normal range (100-120 for upper number and 60-80 for lower number).  However it has caused a persistant dry cough that is making me crazy and seriously disrupting my sleep.  My doctor changed me to another medication 2 days ago and I just found out it is going to take 4-6 weeks to get rid of the cough! So watch out for that.  My doctor didn't mention it as a side effect so I had no idea what was causing it.,4
"If you notice any joint pain or the beginnings of a rash once you begin this medication, discontinue and call your doctor immediately.  Allergic reactions are rare but severe.  When they say giant hives, they mean giant!",1
"High Blood pressure since I was 13. Best drug yet out of many,many drugs. I am 67 now.Question ? what is the long term effect of taking B/P medications this long ?",5
I have no side effects with this drug.,5
