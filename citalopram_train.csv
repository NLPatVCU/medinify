found it difficult to fall asleep.  Went from half a dose to full dose at bedtime and it has not helped.  I seem to not be able to fall asleep being awake alllllllll night.  Any suggestions.,1.0
"I was severely depressed due to a life event in 2003. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I essentially went ""down the rabbit hole"" and couldn't get out. I was a total wreck and had an extremely difficult time working and doing general tasks. My doctor put me on a new drug (at that time): Celexa. It wasn't long and I began sleeping well and functioning better. After 3 months, I was able to get off of them. I haven't had the need to take anti-depressants since that time. I highly recommend it... it definitely worked for me!",5.0
After the firs intake I had  a tremendous diarrhea. After 10 days I have a bleeding(hemorrhage)in my right eye. ,1.0
Since taking this medicine I have become very aggressive for no reason. I have had explosive diarrhea every morning. At night I get indigestion real bad and feel nauseated.,1.0
It has helped me tremendously,4.666666666666667
This med has made me get more depressed then I was had some very bad side effects and made me very aggressive when taking it..........,1.0
"I started taking this years ago and found it treated my depression and anxiety quiet well. I was on 40 mg. I have noticed, however, that my sex drive has decreased and I can't concentrate as well now. I'm going to be talking to my doctor about reducing  the dosage. However, when I first started it it was very effective and it made a huge difference in my life.",3.6666666666666665
"Other than the fact that this makes me very very sleepy, its great.",4.333333333333333
"Ive been taking this medication for a year now and it has helped me in so many ways. I take the 20mg. it took probably about two weeks before i noticed anything different. My family noticed an improvement in my mood the first week. I can wake up in the moring and not feel dread and i can control all my emotions so much better. I dont cry on a drop of a dime anymore. I actually laugh and it feels amazing. This medicine has changed my life. The only thing i get as a sideeffect is the constant yawning, but ive grown accustomed to it. Thank you citalopram.",4.666666666666667
I had taken Citalopram years ago and thought it was replaced as most meds are but I have been on it for a little while(2 weeks) and I already feel better which is great because the medicine I was on made my depression worse.My depression went from a 9 to a 5 on citalopram and I never thought I would get down to a 5 again.,5.0
I have been on Citalopram for two years.  Yawning is still frequent.  But I'm please with this medication.  I get a lot less irritated and anxious since beginning this med. I have noticed a decrease in sexual drive which I'm sure my husband is not happy about.  10 mg. was enough to put me back to feeling myself again.,4.0
"Never really thought it was depression, but maybe it was. Life was just too hard. This medication works very well, and I can usually tell if I miss a dose. Before I took this I wanted to have more intimate and sexual relations with husband. Downside is not caring if I have sex or not.",5.0
"I started taking Citalpram 20mg in March 2016, and have recently had my dose increased to 30mg.  The first couple of weeks on the drug were difficult, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. I yawned a lot, felt less inhibited, and a tiny bit dizzy.  After the side effects wore off, and making sure I took my medication everyday, I can now say I feel much better.  At first I was reluctant to take Citalopram, but I know I needed that extra bit of help. It's not a magic wand, or a wonder drug, but it has helped me to help myself.",4.666666666666667
"Have found that I need to carefully balance the use of this medication with my need for it.  If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.",4.333333333333333
Can't stay awake always tired and doesn't seem to work for me I've had up to 40mg need to try a different tablet,2.3333333333333335

"I took the medication for depression, it did a great job, however I was always tired. I couldn't stay awake on my job, couldn't stay awake while driving. I was just putting myself in harm by taking that medicine. The sleepiness, never went away. ",3.6666666666666665
Started taking 20 mg in 1996. Up to 40 mg for 8 years. Had some really bad things happen in my life.  Went into a deep depression. Didn't seem like it was working anymore. Went to a psychiatrist who had me try over 12 different anti-depressants over 8 months. None of them worked for me. I ended up back on citalopram 60 mg which is working exceptionally well for me. It also helped me with all my anxiety. Can't say enough good things about this med. ,5.0
"taken along with abilify and lamectal, it has worked well",5.0
"I recently had to kick my son out of the house. I could hardly bare it. I couldn't get out of bed and cried every day. I was talked into taking Celexa by my DR. After 3-4 weeks, I did stop crying and could get out of bed. But seeing a counselor helped me the most and have come to terms with my crisis event. After 2.5 months, I have stopped taking Celexa. I talked to my pharmacist and the side effects (for me) were multiple and harsh. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and the worst was the trembling in my hands. I thought I was getting Parkinsons! Good luck to all with finding your happiness.",2.6666666666666665
"This medication has changed my life. It has worked wonders for me. With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.",4.333333333333333

"I've had a chemical imbalance my entire life and mental illness runs on both sides of my family. This is the only medication that has ever helped take the edge off of the emotional roller coaster called ""life"". I've tried other things and this has helped me relax and look at the big picture. Thank God for this medicine and the doctors who created it to help people like me. I feel normal and happy and worry less. ",5.0
"Started on this just over a month ago. No more urges to end it all, much more calm, sleeping better and co-workers have noticed a great improvement in attitude. ",4.333333333333333
This drug gave me a new life- the one i had always felt just out of reach. And it saved my marriage.,4.666666666666667
"Celexa did not work. I never wanted to take an anti-depressant, but when I was finally forced into taking this, it didn't do anything and made it very hard to sleep at night. Insomnia and depression is not a good mix. I then switched to effexor and it works great! My doctor told me 50% of people feel an improvement in the first drug they take.",2.0
"I have been on this medication for five years now for the treatment of depression and anxiety. I absolutely love it, as it allows me to be fully myself. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from depression or anxiety.",5.0
"I am really happy with the medication Citalopram HBR 20MG.  Nightmare and horrible dreams have stopped.  Thoughts of ending my life have ceased greatly. Find myself a lot happier, yet am tired more which I think is good because now I am sleeping at least 7 hours a night.  One side effect I cannot yet understand is a salty taste in my mouth all the time.",4.333333333333333
less anxiety and more energy,4.666666666666667
"Just wondering if anyone has experienced nightly nightmares while taking this drug? I was on cymbalta fir about 3 years, went off due to nightmares, now this drug has the same effect. The nightmares are not always bad, but dreaming and talking in my sleep nightly",4.333333333333333
I am more tolerant of others and they are of me as well as long as I am on this medication.  I have gained ALOT of weight since starting this but I am still happier.  Started with 20mg but 40mg is what i have been on for years now and I definitely have a better outlook on life.,5.0
"FIRST, the best way to take this medication is at bedtime, as it really does make a person tired in the morning (though I know not everyone is the same). I have to agree with many on the fact that it is VERY hard to try to get off of this medication. Unfortunately, for me I am better staying on ot. I use it because I just feel out of control when I am not taking it and a cry easily when not on it. I just pray that anyone searching for help gets the help that they need. It has helped me but, with any medication there are most always side effects. Blessings to all!",3.0
I just started taking citalopram 20mg for depression. So far only side affect is severe nausea but seems to be tapering off but mood seems to be getting happier. I will come back in a few weeks with new review.,3.6666666666666665

"Starting taking this drug after heart bypass surgery in 2012. I was diagnosed with depression after the surgery, apparently it is rather common especially in men after a major event such as surgery. It took a while, but is has been helping. Hopefully I wont have to continue taking it for the rest of my life",4.666666666666667
"When I first started taking citalopram, I had dry mouth and night sweats, but those side effects weren't too bad. Within about 2weeks I noticed that I was smiling more-even when I wasn't necessarily happy. Citalopram has most definitely increased my quality of life. I may not always be happy, but I enjoy life more. I get out more and actually participate in life. I was on 40mg for a few years and have now been on 20mg for ~a month bc I'm trying to titrate down as I may be trying to conceive in a few months. I have had some withdrawal symptoms such as ""brain zaps"" which sounds scarier than they really are. I notice my sadness and irritability more, but I'm pretty laser-focused on trying to get pregnant soon. So I'm toughing it out. I am a bit frightened to not take it at all, but I'll be sure to talk about this with my M.D.",4.666666666666667
"No improvement after 3 months @ 40 mg.  TERRIBLE dry mouth, especially at night. I waken throughout night,'cuz my mouth feels like it's full of toxic glue, and I can't get it hydrated no matter what I try.  I'm titrating off starting today!",2.3333333333333335

"I was on this for two years for depression/anxiety.  At first it worked, but I had to keep increasing my dose and finally it just quit working completely.  Not only was I JUST as depressed as before, but I also gained 25 pounds and can't lose any more than 5 pounds after having been off if for four months.  I do believe it has done something to my metabolism and really hope I can get my body to return to normal.  If I could go back in time, I would NEVER have gotten on this horrible drug.  I will never take an antidepressant again. ",2.0

"I have been on this med for over 10 yrs and don't remember specific side effects early on other than dry mouth.  I notice that I have completely lost interest in sex (but am also menopausal, so which caused that?  idk)  I have had horrible weight gain over the years and like so many others have tried to go off the medication and cannot.  I can tell (as my husband can) if I forgot to take it or if I am even LATE taking it on a particular day.  A couple of years ago my doc added bupropion as the citalopram did not seem to be as effective anymore.  I do feel though, that my quality of life has been much improved with this med.

"Adjusting to 10mg of Cipralex was odd, it disoriented me. I was in a daze for a week. However, after three weeks, my mood was substantially lifted.   I highly recommend this anti-depressant for depression sufferers.   I have never felt so normal in such a long time. But I developed a weird sleep problem. I'd sleep 14 hours a night. I couldn't get out of bed otherwise. I don't know if it's my condition or if it was Cipralex.   I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued.   I talked to my doctor about trying Prozac and he thought it was a good experiment. But I'm very hesitant after seeing the plentiful terrible reviews on WebMD of Prozac.   Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects.",4.333333333333333

"I've been told, by doctors through the years, that I've been depressed all my life and don't know it.  Was prescribed Wellbutrin but it seems I'm one of those rarer side effects.
